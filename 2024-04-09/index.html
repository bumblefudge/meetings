<div onmouseout="$('#link-3').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-3').show()" id="3" class="information">Venkatesh_Rao: A topic that flies under the radar and that&apos;s kind of almost what makes it interesting protocols and standards so some background the summer protocols is um summer research program funded by the ethereum foundation and the goal is to give grants to people working on protocols in the broadest sense so on the loser wide scope aspects of protocols that um normally don&apos;t get as much attention as the detail technical aspects of any particular protocol so by the broadest sense we mean everything from what is the culture of handshakes in um given culture um how does governance and ethereum work how what does the Royal protocol and an imperial medieval court so any usage of the word protocol is in scope for us so the pilot here was last year and we are now in the second year and we are actually in the application Phase for the second Year&apos;s grant program. <a id="link-3" style="display:none;" href="#3">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-4').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-4').show()" id="4" class="information">Venkatesh_Rao: Close this Friday so have any of you are interested please check out summer protocols cam the uh call for applications is there and you can also go to if you&apos;re interested in just um being a bit of a spectator there&apos;s a forum summer of protocols cam where people post their rfc&apos;s request for comments um for their applications and proposals this year so you can see there&apos;s like 60 odd um rfc&apos;s there and we&apos;ll be able to only fund about uh 5 um significant projects so we have 2 grants a larger grant for 2 full-time researchers to do a bigger project and a small micro grant program so for the larger program we have like 60 applications for a 5 spots this year so we have an exciting time ahead to pick 5 okay so that&apos;s the background. <a id="link-4" style="display:none;" href="#4">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-7').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-7').show()" id="7" class="information">Venkatesh_Rao: Started was uh almost a year and a half ago Tim Baker who&apos;s part of the EF reached out to me uh to basically discuss broader philosophical um and managerial issues around ethereum and um he and I and a few other people from the EF including Josh Stark started um basically discussing these broad-based issues and we wrote a pilot study called the unreasonable sufficiency of protocols which you can find on the site uh but while doing that work we realized that the topic is far broader than um our conversations could hope to cover and we realized it would be a really good idea to start a program just focused on these broad aspects uh trying to like step back and look beyond the immediate technical issues not just of ethereum but of protocols in general so deliberate intent from the get-go was to focus on General problems and issues that were specifically instantiated in the ethereum world so for example the ossific of the blockchain but in a broad scope way so. <a id="link-7" style="display:none;" href="#7">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()" id="10" class="information">Venkatesh_Rao: The term that in the blockchain world is used to refer to um what happens to your blockchain as it matures in ages but this is a problem that you encounter in everything from like you know cities um to railway infrastructures to um I don&apos;t know even measurement standards or to talk about the stuff you guys talk about like um protocols and standards around how credentials are used in a society right so everything oif but there&apos;s a sense in which worldwide to study in broadly so that&apos;s kind of how it started last year we uh funded 12 significant what we call Core projects and about 20 what we called affiliate projects that built on the core projects you can see the research as we published it online and I would say the philosophical core of the program last year was to just establish the ground as. <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="information">Venkatesh_Rao: That there&apos;s a there there that there is such a thing we could call protocol science or protocol studies and I think we convinced ourselves that there is such a thing uh we did what we called nerd sniper cells so we kind of like all got really um interested in the topic uh we protocol build ourselves another term we use um and sort of went down various bunny trails and it was all super interesting and I would say the lighthouse idea for our Explorations was a quote by um. <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="information">Venkatesh_Rao: Which goes civilization advances by increasing the number of operations we can do without thinking about them so this idea became our Northstar and all the research projects kind of like Loosely orbited this idea of like what are these unconscious layer of civilizational infrastructure including you know familiar things like you know Screw gauge standards or um you know naming conventions uh all the way to um like soft things like handshakes like I mentioned to now climate protocols blockchain so all these things are kind of belong in these invisible layers that improve our lives but we don&apos;t think about them. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="information">Venkatesh_Rao: And uh last year&apos;s our overall outcome I would say was we convinced ourselves protocol science is a thing and that it should be a first class Citizen and how we think about the world and this year&apos;s Focus I would say is um move a little Downstream from that and start to establish a kind of like practice or discipline we think of as protocol entrepreneurship by which we mean take a domain that has like some uh protocols elements to it and think about either improving the protocols in them or perhaps dismantling the protocols maybe it should not be that protocol and maybe it should be more uh loose and um free flowing right so both protocol and deep protocol in an entrepreneurial sense are in scope and we want to ask what does it take to be a protocol entrepreneur how does it differ from being a regular entrepreneur or a startup founder in Silicon Valley how is it different from Simply being like you know um long-term bureaucrat in a government. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="information">Venkatesh_Rao: Thought I want to plant in your mind is I I&apos;m a big fan of the show Doctor Who and recently I noticed that recent seasons of Doctor Who use the word protocol a lot so this is the reboot since 2007 or so so I got curious and I went to a database and searched for the word protocol in the scripts. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="information">Josh_Stark: Uh and the other is that we you know really think a lot about I guess the kind of you know culture and values and philosophy side of things um it has been joked before that ethereum is really a philosophy project masturbating as a technical implementation uh and we know that the ideas here and the rationale for it is a big piece of that and so we try to pay attention to that as well. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="information">Josh_Stark: An idea about the EF is that we&apos;re not really 1 institution or 1 company um it is really a community of teams uh most teams at the EF are quite independent um they&apos;re just part of this larger umbrella of infrastructure uh that you know we maintain and if you&apos;re not too familiar with the ethereum ecosystem you should know that of course there are many many organizations companies teams outside of the EF itself uh who contribute to the protocol and play a large role in understanding it and developing it and improving it. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="information">Josh_Stark: The third idea that&apos;s important to understand about the EF is that uh we take really seriously and follow what we call a philosophy of subtraction and this is the idea that uh you know it is natural for institutions to want to accumulate power and to accumulate influence and Prestige and we know that we have to push back against that uh we very actively want to make space for others to step up and contribute to the protocol and to share the responsibilities of maintaining this this public good this open source project for others and so we try to have a quite light touch and we think very intentionally about uh where we can subtract ourselves uh so that others can add to the ecosystem in our place so that&apos;s the EF broadly um as M just said this kind of kicked out of um some thinking and discussions about you know questions that kept coming up um you know both inside the ethereum foundation and just in this it gives us some more broadly. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
