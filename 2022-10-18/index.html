<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="information">Harrison_Tang: To actually give us a presentation on ceramic and I think you&apos;ll go over what ceramic is right and then as well as why is it important and then we&#8217;ll open up to the general Q&amp;A at the end of his presentation so without further Ado Matthew please take the floor. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Awesome thank you would you guys prefer that I shared slides or do you want me to just talk because I can do either way. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Perfect no problem. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Okay so before I dive super deep into the slides I just want to give you guys a little about me I joined 3Box Labs to work on the ceramic Network about 9 or 10 months ago I come from traditional web2 companies prior to ending up at Ceramic I did a long stint at GitHub building Professional Services for that team so now I&apos;m a developer advocate in this space I&apos;ve done a lot with data over the  <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Years I traveled around the world and did a bunch of like database consulting for a while <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="information">Matthew_Davis: And that&apos;s kind of what led me into the ceramic world of things since ceramic definitely aims to be composable data on like the web3 mindset of building applications so that&apos;s a little about me let&apos;s dive into what ceramic is. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Also I&apos;m the lead developer Advocate on the team so when we open up the Q&amp;A session there might be a couple questions that I don&apos;t have the answers to for sure I mainly interface with developers and integrating this into their applications rather than like high-level strategic view stuff but any type of question that I can&apos;t answer for you here I can get over to our leadership team and they&apos;ll be able to answer that and I can follow up with you guys so <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  don&apos;t hesitate to try to throw me to <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="information">Matthew_Davis: the Wolves but at the same time you guys might get me on one or two so you&apos;ll have to forgive me. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="information">Matthew_Davis: So our team&apos;s been around for a while. Our core Foundry started at consensus way back in 2016 really focused on building leading web3 developer products most recently we&apos;ve shipped something around DIDs so decentralized identifiers called DID session we&apos;ll talk about a little bit later it&apos;s really awesome I think it&apos;s like the number one product for our team to be proud about with how they&apos;re managing DIDs and sessions for <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  apps as well as using those <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="information">Matthew_Davis: DIDs to control data and provide you know Sovereign data to the owner of the DID and stuff and we shipped compose DB which expands our database layer to allow a lot more indexing to make it more queryable and to conform a little better with traditional standards like graphql so we&apos;ve shipped a lot of things before that we&apos;ve worked hard on like chain agnostic capability objects we&apos;ve worked hard on react libraries like self-id. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  and a whole suite of <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Developer tools along the way some of you might have actually stumbled upon ceramic and not realized it if you&apos;ve ever used like 3 ID connect to get decentralized identifier from let&apos;s say Meta mask then you used ceramic in some way shape or form that used to be the flagship like product was this 3id connect which would pop an iframe the problem with that is it was very like user heavy the user had to <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  assign a lot of transactions to do very simple things so it didn&apos;t like <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Provide the best user experience DID session kind of solves that so I think in order to understand the value prop of ceramic it&apos;s really important to walk through a very simple user Journey it&apos;s one that we can probably all resonate with everyone of us has signed up to a social app I&apos;m sure whether it be Facebook Twitter LinkedIn right name one you signed up to it excuse me during sign up time you probably answered some standardized information. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  Like what your name is, what your birthday might be, where you&#8217;re located, a username <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="information">Matthew_Davis: And then once you&apos;re like logged in maybe you set up site preferences and then you had to go through this really long painful process of finding the people that you like in life to follow or the people that motivate you and you have to like follow them or and then if something goes wrong you have to unfollow them and this isn&apos;t a bad flow this is just like using an app but it gets really cumbersome when we go from one app to ten apps or however <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  many social apps exist a lot of them ask for the same information upon signup <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Right whether that&apos;s name birthday location we kind of get the point they all kind of had the same flow too once you&apos;re signed up and you&apos;re logged in then you&apos;re still adding and following your friends and your connections and and all the messaging and stuff exists this is not only a problem because we&apos;re repeating a bunch of data the bigger problem is that all of this data gets stored on that social app&#8217;s servers so if you consider Facebook which I think we can all agree Facebook has the <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  most wonderful data <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Practices of all time uh-huh all that sign up information and all that info about you get stored on Facebook servers and then when we sign up for Twitter it all gets stored on Twitter servers and what we signed up on LinkedIn it all gets sorted Linked In servers and these servers don&apos;t communicate with each other and you no longer own that data about yourself you you lose agency so you yourself the owner of the data has no agency over what happens to that data going forward. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  And this is kind of scary for developers <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="information">Matthew_Davis: too because what if Facebook Twitter LinkedIn whatt if they decide to shut down the API to that data right now a lot of these social platforms they allow open access to APIs so that developers can query the data and use it in other applications but there&apos;s still like this really weird like layer of trust that we have to trust that we&apos;re getting the correct view back from Facebook and Twitter and whoever might have the agency over this data. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  So this is like <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="information">Matthew_Davis: The major hurdle that we try to solve and it&apos;s not just one that we woke up to one day and said hey like let&apos;s let&apos;s fix a problem that&apos;s not real we&apos;re seeing a lot of web3 companies really demand that sovereignty over data exists for their user base and that&apos;s really what we&apos;re aiming to tackle so for us ceramic what it really is is a decentralized network for composable data and it doesn&#8217;t necessarily <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Make your application web 3 however it definitely contributes to the web3 stack. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="information">Matthew_Davis: It kind of comes in three very distinct components and if we can wrap our heads around these three components I think what ceramic is becomes really clear at the bottom layer the bare minimum here there&apos;s a ceramic node and this is just a small application that interfaces with ipfs it&apos;s the underlying infrastructure this is not currently an incentivized layer it will however one day be incentivized so that if you choose to. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  just be a node operator you can be a node operator. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="information">Matthew_Davis: So a node is is basically the small application that runs interfaces with ipfs but it is what decentralizes all the data stored on the ceramic Network the purpose of this is when we need to scale we can just horizontally scale by adding another node the main responsibility of a node is really providing the validity of the data so when we request data from a server that that that data is what it&apos;s supposed to be that the state is <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  current there&apos;s blockchain proof that accompanies that data to some degree <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="information">Matthew_Davis: And says &#8220;hey this data is correct&#8221; it also really keeps track of the stream history when I say stream I don&apos;t mean streaming data like we might find in Kafka or some other big data solution data streams on ceramic are very much just like Json objects of data so you could think like a mongodb document for us we call that a data Stream So these things go through changes consider if a user. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  they signed up <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="information">Matthew_Davis: to social app a and they said their name was Matt Davis and then all of a sudden I decided to start going by Matthew and I wanted to change my name I&apos;m going to need to update that stream about who I am to say Matthew instead of matt so ceramic will keep track of all of those changes to the data and what happens is when we do a read if it&apos;s an unknown read we will rebuild the history of all the changes that have ever happened to that data stream from genesis including  <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="information">Matthew_Davis: all the blockchain proofs to verify that what we are currently seeing since it was previously unknown to us is valid and accurate to the most current state so the node handles all of this stuff for us which is great because it would be a lot to have to handle on our own so the second layer to that is called compose DB and this is one of our newest products out the door if you used ceramic in the past this might have been called <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="information">Matthew_Davis:  ceramic we have renamed it to compose DB and added  <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-53').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-53').show()" id="53" class="information">Matthew_Davis: A bunch of <a id="link-53" style="display:none;" href="#53">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-54').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-54').show()" id="54" class="information">Matthew_Davis: functionality to it however at this layer this is an API that&apos;s always going to be open and that&apos;s also what the ceramic nodes help with is maintaining the openness of this API so that we at Ceramic could never take it away from developers like it&apos;s always going to be open and available so compose DB allows developers to create and distribute like commonly accepted data schemas for these apps so if we go back and we look at this problem <a id="link-54" style="display:none;" href="#54">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-55').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-55').show()" id="55" class="information">Matthew_Davis: Of name birthday location this this might be something like a user profile and this is a common schema that&apos;s used across apps or site preferences might be a specific schema shape and same for friends and followers so compose DB allows those developers to say hey I&apos;m going to outline what a common basic profile looks like once I build that schema I&apos;m going to publish it to the network and that <a id="link-55" style="display:none;" href="#55">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-57').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-57').show()" id="57" class="information">Matthew_Davis: for that schema and say hey instead of rebuilding a user profile let me just use what already exist and what becomes really cool about this is this is the composability piece if a user. <a id="link-57" style="display:none;" href="#57">✪</a></div>
