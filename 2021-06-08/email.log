Topic: Eip712Signature2021

https://uport-project.github.io/ethereum-eip712-signature-2021-spec/
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/194
Wayne Chang:  We will open it up after this topic to discuss 
  other topics people want on the agenda
  ...Goal is to issue LD credentials compliant with Ethereum 
  signing requirements
  ...This is an LD proof mechanism using a crypto wallet
  ...and usable with Metamask
<orie> I think their implementation uses JCS instead of URDNA2015
  ...Oliver did most of the work but was unable to join so I am 
  presenting on his behalf
<orie> an approach similar to workday signature suite
  ...Digest and Signature algorithm is the same that Ethereum 
  uses
<orie> signing arbitrary data is dangerous? I thought that was a 
  feature of JWTs :)
<orie> /s
  ...Many wallets in the Ethereum ecosystem are compliant with 
  this
  ...Well timed with the LD Signature work to show the 
  flexibility and usage
<heather_vescent> Thanks Wayne, sorry I was late, previous call 
  ran over.
Adrian Gropper:  What is the relationship between Metamask and 
  blockchain wallets?
<orie> Adrian : 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/
Orie Steele: Specifically: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#Address
Wayne Chang:  Difficult to issue JWT with Metamask
Adrian Gropper:  Under what circumstances do you use two wallets?
  ...does non-repudiation require a third?
<orie> yikes to everything that is being said about 
  "non-repudiation"
Adrian Gropper:  Healthcare normally requires hardware token
<cel> cryptocurrency wallets may be used with hardware tokens
Wayne Chang:  Need separate topic to look at healthcare
<identitywoman> sorry I'm late - did we already do annoucements? 
  I have one
I can't hear Orie
<rgrant> i can
<heather_vescent> I can hear you Orie
Orie Steele:  Part of the universal wallet interop spec was the 
  relationship between cryptocurrencies, blockchain identifiers, 
  VCs, etc. all of these things are related in that people use the 
  words "wallet" to describe various aspects of this. keys are used 
  to xfer cryptocurrencies
Orie Steele:  Keys are used to sign VCs. the statements about 
  non-repudiation are likely too technical to go to now, but you 
  can do it without hardware-bound keys.
Orie Steele:  We tried to go over this in the universal wallet 
  specification, and we'd love to continue the conversation there 
  to answer those questions.
Orie Steele: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#Address
Heather Vescent:  Thank you for answering the questions.
  ...Are you making it so that Eth wallets can hold and issue 
  VC's?
Wayne Chang:  Issuance and signing, yes. Holding and verifying 
  not the current focus
<phil.l> When the wallet "issues a credential"  are you not 
  creating a presentation in this case?
Heather Vescent:  That was the "what," how is this accomplished?
Wayne Chang:  The signature suite
Heather Vescent:  There are many different signature suites. Is 
  there a way to categorize what this does to aid in repo cleanup?
Wayne Chang:  This may be part of the up and coming working group 
  to handle
Wayne Chang:  Would love to work with the working group members 
  on structure
<orie> I'm supportive of the work item (speaking for Transmute)
Ryan Grant:  Question about eip712. What is the intent?
Wayne Chang:  Looking at claim data standards into eip712 for use 
  in Metamask
  ...Signature then to be compliant with VC
Ryan Grant:  Wallet is responsible for taking JSON-LD and 
  presenting in an eip712 format?
Wayne Chang:  Yes. Companion work should include an explainer.
  ...Metamask supports multiple accounts and wallets.
<orie> Linked Data Proof suites are used for both Verifiable 
  Credentials and Verifiable Presentations
<orie> Issuers Issue VCs, Holders Present VPs
Wayne Chang:  Primarily relying on signature component vs holding 
  within the wallet.
Adrian Gropper:  This sounds like it has little to do with the 
  signature suite but rather what is presented to you
  ...Metamask has a vested interest to present accurately
<orie> Similar examples of Linked Data Proof suites:
<heather_vescent> Thanks for that questions agropper.
Wayne Chang:  Not just Metamask but all wallets compliant with 
  eip712
<identitywoman> I made a comment up above about whether 
  announcements already happened - I was late. I have one.
<orie> nothing could be safer than javascript crypto in a web 
  browser.
<orie> /s
<heather_vescent> (I also have an announcement and joined late 
  too wayne)
<heather_vescent> (But my q+ is not for that)
Adrian Gropper:  The reason you are doing this in LD context is 
  that this is easier to check, thus reliability?
Wayne Chang:  Yes
Wayne Chang:  This is possible with LD proofs and not JWT
  ...Significant code changes to such a high security format is 
  unlikely
<cel> ethereum signing for JWT would need a new JWS algorithm 
  registered
<orie> another version of what wayne is saying is that IANA is 
  unlikely to register an eip712 `alg` field any time soon :0
Heather Vescent:  Thank you wayne for bringing this to the 
  meeting
<agropper> I'm happy to help on what Hearher's suggesting
  ...this is a heavy lift to understand the excitement about what 
  is being proposed. Can we summarize this or add a README to 
  describe what is being accomplished here?
Wayne Chang:  Should we start an issue to create an explainer?
Heather Vescent:  Yes, and I am willing to edit if others prepare 
  the work.

Topic: Announcements & Community Topics

Kaliya Young: 
  https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/GHP+Blueprint+Public+Review+Process
Kaliya Young:  The good health pass has reached draft stage 
  yesterday with 10 days of review
Orie Steele: 
  https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange/
  ...Specify formats and interop
  ...how to we get credentials to be exchanged for international 
  travel
Heather Vescent:  Last Friday rgrant and I met on how to record 
  minutes
  ...It is recorded and details the process
  ...Point 2, VC's for Ed will be added to the 101 series
Wayne Chang:  Are there topics that the community would like to 
  discuss?
Adrian Gropper:  Would like to talk about how VCs go from the 
  issuer to the verifier in the context of vaccine credentials
<orie> verifiable credentials don't go from the issuer to the 
  verifier, without the consent of the holder...
  ...Topic would be called "Authorization"
Wayne Chang:  Others? We should send a survey after this since 
  this is a bit on the spot
Adrian Gropper:  Geotrust architecture
<wayne_chang> "Zero Trust"
  ...as a result of the executive order for Zero Trust 
  Architecture (not geotrust)
Wayne Chang:  I would like to talk about normalization and 
  growing privacy
  ...Apple just released Identity on the phone
Orie Steele: 
  https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/digital-ids-might-sound-like-a-good-idea-but-they-could-be-a-privacy-nightmare/
  ...We should assume this is coming and nations are moving to 
  digital identity
  ...what are the risks?
Orie Steele:  Should we ask EFF or ACLU to come talk to us?
<identitywoman> The ACLU just put out an anti mDL paper - but in 
  that said nice things about VCs :)
<identitywoman> I know the author.
Adrian Gropper: +1 To ACLU or EFF on this
  ...It would be great to hear from these groups
<manu> Yes, let's please invite them in and have a discussion 
  with them!
Phil Long:  In Edu, the interest in the richness of metadata to 
  represent achievements is growing
<identitywoman> You might want to use an EDV :)
  ...There is an issue about the structure of credentials
Adrian Gropper: +1 Phil - it's all about authorization
Wayne Chang:  I was personally interested in microcredentials
  ...OpenBadges will supported
Phil Long:  I am part of this group. A topic is an evidence array 
  which can point to (URI) evidence that may be too big to pack 
  into a credential.
  ...Assertions related to the course curriculum or achievement 
  is also requested.
Kaliya Young:  If anyone is interested, I can talk about my book 
  "The Domains of Identity"
Wayne Chang:  The may be a chance of mandated interoperability
  ...recent chatter at FCC
  ...called Competitive Interoperability for anti-trust
  ...Competitive Compatibility
Ryan Grant: 
  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/competitive-compatibility-year-review
Adrian Gropper:  Is this like open banking?
Wayne Chang:  Yes, possibly like PSD2
  ...In the EU, one market that is competitive for all citizens, 
  not just those locally
Adrian Gropper:  Relates to authorization. Control is 
  consolidated around processor. Therefore, we need regulations.
Wayne Chang:  What about ESSIF?
  ...Should we broaden to other regional initiatives (e.g. DHS, 
  BC, Singapore)?
<wayne_chang> kicking to stop meeting in 3 seonds...
