\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:11:51.947Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Hopefully hopefully what we can talk about through these so with that then let me just get started so sort of Court part presentation you know what's what's fed CM introduction about it a bit of a we expect it to go and then how I think there's an intersection with choppy and Perhaps Perhaps the places in which there isn't an intersection choppy.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:11:52.341Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 okay so just.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:12:00.313Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Section about fit CM any questions so far anyone that's just seemed like a reasonable agenda.

\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:12:36.733Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 to contextualize things.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:13:09.572Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Federation at least for Consumer consumers being one of the two ways in which you can create accounts with websites you know you can use usernames and passwords or you can use Federation any using username passwords are typically these are backed by e-mail verification or phone number verification so at the core of like creating crania Council website you have only these two mechanisms and in we and.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:13:09.956Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 while Federation has its challenges.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:13:36.551Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: We think it has it has benefits over usernames and passwords so it felt like something worth preserving and maintaining on the web past keys are are evolving a lot to and making usernames and passwords a lot better in many ways it's so this is a moving Target but in and on itself we felt like Federation is something that's worth it seemed like good for the web.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:14:10.178Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Or the contest go in which fat cm is in is that Federation as as you will find choppy to was was built was designed unintentionally on what browser vendors called low level Primitives these are things like iframes third-party cookies and redirects these are these are low level Primitives because their general purpose the they are general purpose Primitives that can be used for.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:14:10.831Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 or a variety of things and just by accident one of the things that.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:14:43.265Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Used and abused by the ecosystem is cross-site tracking so cross sidetracking has become a problem on the web and it's the large likely the most active area of Investigation for for web browsers Safari and Firefox and chrome all pushing very hard on preventing tracking on the web and what in the big the big problem is that we call this the classification problem.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:14:43.551Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 because as far as a web browser is configured.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:15:11.045Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: It doesn't know the distinction between tracking versus reasonable uses of vulnerable Primitives because the smaller the classification problem because browsers are having a hard time preventing tracking while maintaining and preserving the valid uses of these Primitives one of which being things like creating accounts or websites with third-party identity providers.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:15:43.581Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: So you will see specifically in things like chappie for example that uses these low-level Primitives you know them being postmessage iframe third-party cookies and but window pops the browser vendors are more and more trying to constrain in and mitigate tracking and in doing so having an effect unintended effect on values cases so for chapter specifically.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:15:43.929Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 in the absence of third party cookies.

\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:17:58.943Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: That that would perhaps make this process a little bit better so that's the context in which fed cm is in the context in which fed cm is in is that browser vendors are making interventions on third-party cookies and cross-site communication and in doing so it's causing pain for deployment of federation so what phet SIM is is its high level I did you.

\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:18:33.469Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: I but it's one that makes a trade-off between extensibility and control so it's not as expressive as third-party cookies in iframes and postmessage this less expressive than that but it's but because of because it's able to narrow the the language and expressivity it's able to offer the user more control so so so fat Sam is a web platform API so so think of it as an alternative to you know third-party cookies of purpose message.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:19:38.811Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: So there's this there's much to be preserved here but then we always thought that in the process of preservation in the process of making so that we're not breaking the things that exist it would be good to make it so that you know once we take that step it allows us to do things that we wouldn't be able to do otherwise their Federation has massive amount of problems and we thought that maybe by introducing the browser as a neutral intermediator that maybe it would enable things to be.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:19:39.452Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 done that wasn't possible.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:20:13.364Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: The most concrete example is the Nazca flag problem that's got a flag problem with you're all very familiar with because chappie you know it's it's a problem that requires a neutral intermediator you know in your case you'll be invented often dot IO but in fact CM we've constructed that in the browser itself so that it's because they do you don't have to introduce a new origin but it can only be done right because you because you have this neutral party that.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:20:46.493Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: That's a bit abstract so I need to turn that into something concrete so but this is precisely concretely what fat skin is actually in production today if you try it so if you went to Chrome stable right if you're using Chrome or very or variant of chrome then it's likely that you will start seeing some of these account Chooser widgets that allows you to log into websites with your identity provider accounts in this specific case.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:21:21.305Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Being the identity provider but here you see kind of like a brochure mediated you I come in from the bottom you know suggesting your Google accounts to log into recipe website you can pick one of them and it looks like an account Chooser it's partially is and it's constructing such a way that the identity provider doesn't learn about the user going to recipe website up until the point in which the user clicks continuous Eliza meaning that.

\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:25:06.339Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: As recoverable as Federation so Federation bundled both on identification as well as identification so it is the case that Federation today is used for signing into websites but if I had to make a projection I would expect a lot of the signing into websites with we Federation to move towards a more secure and private mechanisms such as passkeys so you know we were.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:25:06.826Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 working really hard and this is I'm not a direct.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:25:42.325Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: To web often but I'm within the group that is but we I can say collectively like we're working really hard as browser vendors to make web often extremely successful right it has all the right properties when it comes to authentication and creating and creating accounts websites meaning you know like it discloses as little as possible from the user right it doesn't share the users email or Globe identifiers you know the private keys are directed you know public/private key cryptography.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:25:42.916Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 much better than most things combined and it's the user experience is seamless in.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:26:15.916Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Wonderful because it's proportional to the amount of risk that users taking right so the first separation perhaps to be made which I think is useful is to know that from a projection perspective we expect and want web off and succeed in allowing users to create a council websites and we expect web identity to to deal with with with with your identity so just that separation is a we.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:26:16.482Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 acted to be important as we go along now.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:26:47.357Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: It's a bit too abstract so let me try to make this into a little bit more concrete so first right like the you creating user names and passwords it's always predicated on something as recoverable as as an email address verification or phone number verification I'm also the editor for web OTP that does this verification phone numbers and email addresses but the but the the idea.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:27:22.649Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Fetch him to be something that allows you to express yourself in many different ways so so obviously Federation is much larger than Google itself as you all know it was probably actually the second or third identity provider so you know we're working hard to make it so that identity providers like Facebook and Twitter and apple you know see value in fat cm and in find ways to have their users represented in such a way that it can take there.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:27:54.534Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: We constructed fetch him such that it's not bound to Google as an identity provider because we know that the Federation is much larger than Google and we think that one of the things that we're excited about which I think has a big connection with choppy is that you know it's you know it's it's there's a reason why there's a NASCAR flag right the reason why there's an extra flag is because you know not all users are Facebook users not all users.

\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:40:07.519Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 Direction perspective it's.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:40:41.088Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Actually speaking it's it's easier to have the one intermediator control over all the identity providers right in in representing your needs then to have all the identity providers do that by themselves or to regulation and so if I hear you and I believe that from a direction perspective we're going to be in a better place than we are with the status quo Heaven having these things be done in.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:41:38.555Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: It was more of a trajectory and structs Architectural argument then a snapshot argument I think I think if you look at the ecosystem today you'll be right that the controls the browser vendors in the FED cm is exposed in aren't sufficient but I just wanted to say that I think that architecture Ali this is the better call because it would allow us to do so in a way that is more at scale than it was before so.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:46:41.426Z]	<Transcriber>	TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Years it built to be decentralized and distributed or is it confined to the browser vendors for that sort of thing.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:47:16.496Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: I mean we do should we would have to get into the specifics to for me to actually answer that question in a concrete and constructive way but we know that Federation is something that is much bigger than any single browser vendor right and so it is we have we have we have constructed pet CM such that there's a passing which other browser vendors can use it to like Firefox and Safari but then in addition to that we also know that you can log into.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:47:17.094Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 website you can log into net.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:47:50.912Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Over your desktop and then go through Android phone and use it to using Federation right and so we have constructed fed cm in such a way that we expect it to be something that is available not only across browser vendors but also across operating systems so so we expect it to be you know it's already desire for this to be pushed down into the stack all the way to operating systems such to Android iOS windows and Linux can can be that intermediator too.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:47:51.345Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 so I don't know if that answers your questions but.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:47:56.164Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: I it we certainly sir.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:47:59.800Z]	<Transcriber>	TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Almost it sounds like my personal laptop could serve as.

\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:48:50.352Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Yeah that would be correct so so if your laptop is a Linux machine then yes I would expect Linux to support this at some point if your laptop is a Mac machine then yes I would expect Mac OS to support that at some point as well as Windows and it's going to be a long term play but yes we Something That We're much like we have often right if you think about the web often play strategy web often cannot succeed unless browser vendors and or prison vendors also supported so.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:48:50.928Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 it could just cannot succeed unless Linux supports web often and windows.

\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:49:17.587Z]	<Transcriber>	BrentZ: All right so you said that the browser knows which idps the user is logged into which is cool it solves that NASCAR problem does that mean that the browser vendor also knows all of the different idps that the that the user has or is logged into or is it the local thing.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:49:48.738Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Oh so this will likely vary per browser vendor so but but but if you're locked out of the your browser then likely you're not storing that information back into the browser vendor as servers in fetch him specifically today I believe that if you are logged into Google into your browser we don't send any information back to Google servers so I think it's a local it's a local thing only.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:49:49.197Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 they're Engineers on the call where.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:50:09.937Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Of first and smarter than myself that can maybe confirma tonight is on the chat but I believe that it yeah csee still it's one of the engineers but yes yeah I believe that the best of my knowledge it is something that is kept locally as opposed to synchronize across your devices.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:50:19.679Z]	<Transcriber>	mprorock: Awesome alright we got about 10 minutes there you want to fire into the interest because I think there's some great collection points so.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:50:30.581Z]	<mprorock>	** starts up network sniffer **
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:50:53.649Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: This is likely the most interesting part I guess but it's also the least well-constructed one so stay with me a bit of a impromptu presentation here but yeah so let's let's just page back your memory this is what we have in in Chrome since 108 which was launched in November so it's still like in its infancy but this is what you have in production today that you can use right now if you wanted to as I said it sucks for a variety of reasons for one you can only use one identity provider at a time which kind of.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:50:54.220Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 sucks for two like he has a lot of language here that is signing specific you know and so on.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:50:56.897Z]	<Will>	present+
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:51:25.288Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: But but here but I wanted to give you a sense of projection of the things that were working on that I think will have the connection with choppy so here so here's let's so the first exercise that I went through with Dimitri at iaw left iow what's to look at Champion fed cm in turn and try to compare and contrast we were both looking at this are like huh they seem to be they seem to look at they seem to be similar things here you know what are the commonalities what are the differences here so first.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:51:25.726Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 you know I think it's important.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:52:00.798Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Both Champion fed CM operate as an intermediary between entities right in the charity case it's a it's a wallet selector in the FED same cases and account selector but both of them operates as a intermediate as a neutral intermediator to the user it's not an important detail but I just wanted to say that architecturally speaking chappie implements this in userland over off and but IO which is to be trusted whereas fed CM implements this in the browser but.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:52:01.403Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 if you discuss an implementation detail I think Chuck it was designed such that it could find its way to browse.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:52:35.240Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: So what you see here is a neutral intermediator that constrains the use two specific things like choosing wallets or choosing accounts it's also similar in many ways in that it connects in intermediates to different things to different these first in the case of chappie for issuance and for presentation you have the issuer and the verifier right saying like I want to start this or I want to get this right and so which is.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:52:35.761Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 Advanced GM would call a relying party meaning that it's.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:53:08.531Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Say that once the users account right and then you also have in choppy this selector of wallets that you have register in the past of their do you have access to right and in fact seems formulation is what we call an identity provider right but if you look at the threat model here right someone in chappie said we should show the origin of the website which show the origin of the issues so playground the chapter that I owe that is not by.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:53:08.876Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 mistake that it's there right that that is a critical thing.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:53:45.025Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: And then also demo dot various wallet that Dev it's also not by mistake that that orange is over there because that is the threat model that you have I'll put aside the rest of the ux because I think it's easier to see the connection between the two now these are the commonalities perhaps a differences are like I said some of the language here right so for one chappie is you know it's presented to the user as a wallet selector whereas fed cm is predictably users an account selector in chappie you are able to have multiple wallets rights.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:53:45.858Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 if that's him right now you can only pick accounts from a single identity provider like I said you have the wallet language.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:53:45.950Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Some of the.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:54:20.874Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Choices you know one is a modal dialog the others and all modal dialog chappie has a really interesting property of allowing what is to be registered as opposed to announced breastfed CM still operates in a model in which the relying party has to announce which I didn't provide is it won't work what's work with chappie can work with Native apps whereas potassium only works called providers okay but those are the differences but I wanted to give you a sense of the work that we're doing because I think that as we finish that work.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:54:21.295Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 work a lot of these differences are going to be decreasing so for one we're working on this thing.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:54:56.796Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Identity provider API which allows you to which allows our website to say I can take accounts from all these many different identity providers so what you see here in the specific Mark is it's very subtle so apologies for just being hard to read here but you see accounts coming from fat see em that shit chappie wallet won't a glitched on me which is a different origin from web idea that fat CM that this glitch about me meaning that these are accounts coming from different Origins right just imagine these being Facebook and Google.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:54:57.396Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 or Facebook and Twitter right but accounts from coming from multiple identity providers.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:54:57.683Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: We have the.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:55:31.086Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Well behind a flag and we expect to watch this as soon as we can you see here a bit of a demo what that looks like you know it's probably hard to read but this is this is one way in which you can have an identity provider in addition to Google as an identity provider embedded within the same UI dialogue so you see that this is the Google account wasn't come was before okay so with that I think we crossed out one of the.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:55:31.468Z]	<mprorock>	q?
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:55:31.551Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 Frances that chappie has multiple wallets in 50m can have.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:55:35.153Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Just now multiply deep identity providers.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:56:09.307Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Another another API that we've been working on is something that we call the art P contacts API and that is an API that allows relying parties to be more explicit about what context the fat emui problem is being is being used so like I said to you before like with membership cards and at getting access to journals and so on you know signing in isn't the action of the users taking is so RPS want the control to you know just use language that's more appropriate so.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:56:09.672Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 right now we have four different options that we implemented you can.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:56:42.645Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Language which is use use website with your identity provider or continue to website with your identity provider in addition to signing in in signing up so this gives our Peas the ability to you know just use different language in the dialogue and I think with that I think it's easy to kind of like incrementally add like a at wallet context or you know a % % credential kind of thing where.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:56:43.082Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 we're we can move away.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:57:18.890Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Fans from the language of identity providers and signing in for language where you can connect with a wallet like language and with that I think we cross all of a bunch of differences to I wanted to show you two like a small prototype that we built for what we call the identity provider registry API but it's an API that looks a lot like if you ever use register protocol Handler it's a very similar API but it's an API that allows an identity provider to register itself it's.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:57:19.528Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 to ask for the user's permission to be an identity provider and in doing so allows relying parties.
\f1\fs24 \

\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:57:50.812Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: For any registered provider as opposed to having to name them so if you look at the developer console here the API was called in a way that the providers weren't named in that you didn't call for Google as an identity provider or Facebook is a knitted provider it presupposes that you have registered identity providers and that's really wonderful for a variety of reasons in that you can bring your own identity provider to websites but I think we'll see once we do that then it's isomorphic to wallet.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:57:50.956Z]	<mprorock>	q?
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:58:26.235Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Okay so with that then we can I think we can also do well at registration so if you remove then all the differences then if you if you make a projection where it fits him is going to be like in a few in a few in a few quarters perhaps at the end of the year then it's likely that we're going to find fewer of these differences between champion and fed cm and so on can we only have a couple more minutes so I just wanted to perhaps and with.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:58:27.088Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 this with this like perhaps because I think it's perhaps the most goals concrete one to bring to this group here.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:59:01.910Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: I just wanted to kind of like put it on there like Fitz can compete with cross arching tracking and cook third-party cookies and postmessage not with chappie per se so I think what I mean imagine is more like a chappie overfed CM like chappie using fed cm is a third party cookies more so than chappie fetch a meal replacement of chappie and for the large extent it would be wonderful if we could make things backwards compatible so what I mean imagine is more like trying to remove the the the.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:59:02.499Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto:\'a0 the awkward parts of chappie being off that are your own interpreter.

\f0\fs32 [2023-01-24T17:59:23.251Z]	<Transcriber>	Sam_Goto: Right but maintained and exchange that to fetch him calls but maintain backwards compatibility between wallets issues and verifier such that they don't have to know that that change happened okay I think I'm going to end here because I think I'm going to run all the time I'm not sure.
