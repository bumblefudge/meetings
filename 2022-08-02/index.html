<div class="information">&lt;kaliya&gt; Identity is a central theme for us. Recently, the DeSoc paper advanced powerful new concepts and served to ignite important conversations and initiatives around this theme within the blockchain space. Moreover, many other communities, such as the Internet Identity Workshop, W3C working groups, and others, have worked on related challenges and fostered many of the innovations that are being used on the current web with tooling developed and ready for Web3 too.  We believe that the challenge of furthering open protocols that can support better and more scalable forms of digital sociality, greater local control and federation as well as composable and community-bound rights, is within reach.</div>
