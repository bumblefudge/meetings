Daniel Du Seuil:  For ESSIF under eIDAS
Daniel Du Seuil:  Slide 21
Daniel Du Seuil:  We can provide more elaborate legal report
Daniel Du Seuil:  We will be sharing in the next month
Lluís Alfons Ariño:  Open for questions
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Question about slide 16
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Verifiable credential hashes - how do they 
  work with right to erasure, permanence.  is a hash sufficiently 
  de-identified.  what tradeoffs did you make.  what determinations 
  did you make re: GDPR
Daniel Du Seuil:  Will share GDPR study.  want to limit what can 
  be traced back to individual.  We don't put VC on ledger, just 
  the hash, maybe with start and end date.  doesn't show VC itself, 
  just like a fingerprint
Erik Anderson:  Ongoing discussions re GDPR
Erik Anderson:  Looking at legal implications.  might put 
  pseudonyms for certain cases on ledger
Erik Anderson:  GDPR is a concern.  bottom line we do put things 
  on ledger but minimize correlation
Nate Otto:  Question about VC and DIDs on slide 17.  what DID 
  method is used and how id for individual is provisioned for 
  individual
Erik Anderson:  Not cast in stone yet.  we will allow users to 
  create their own DIDs, and own wallets, but will put minimal 
  requirements for DIDs.  DIDs need to be unique and you must be 
  able to show control.  Will be used for authentication and we 
  have minimal standards
Erik Anderson:  To meet legal requirements
Erik Anderson:   Exact format of DIDs are being fine tuned.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Anthony asked about VCs in XML to satisfy 
  legal binding signatures.  How can we help - can CCG express XML 
  serialization to help you?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Maybe jsonLD sigs would be acceptable.  what 
  do you think we can do to help you.
Erik Anderson:  Yes, we can align work.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  With PESC XML transcripts we may have use 
  cases that need XML VC support.  we've had discussions on mailing 
  list.  starting to understand it is all doable.  wondering about 
  overall priorities
Erik Anderson:  Would be great to collaborate.  will have initial 
  study available next week
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  In slide 17, W3C peer did is mentioned.  is 
  that a work in progress?  are peer kids something you looked into 
  and how will you use?
Daniel Du Seuil:  Peer dis are very interesting - less tracking, 
  more secure, more privacy.  following interactions.  valuable 
  concept to follow.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Reference on peer dids: 
  https://www.slideshare.net/SSIMeetup/peer-dids-a-secure-and-scalable-method-for-dids-thats-entirely-offledger-daniel-hardman
Kim Hamilton Duffy: @Blazp I will read it
Blaž Podgorelec: @Kimhd thank you!
Dominik Beron:  Everything boils down to privacy.  legal entities 
  are less problematic than actual persons.  peer dids aren
Dominik Beron:  Aren't necessarily stable.  We are looking at it.
Erik Anderson:  Much easier to implement anywise DID but might 
  have GDPR issues - don't want to allow correlations.  if we 
  correlate to a single number we will not get a good GDPR report.
Erik Anderson:  We think we might have to go to peer dids
Erik Anderson:  A single European number is dangerous.  a 
  verifiable id can be used with legal effect
