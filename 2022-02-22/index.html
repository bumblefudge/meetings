<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  So there were a couple of themes that sort of threads if you will that were woven throughout the different set of recommendations that I outlined last week but I think one of the number one things that came up in that we need to discuss is what I will call the need for crypto agility and so this is especially Critical with the forthcoming. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  Ocean from the current set of nist approved algorithms to the Future set of post Quantum crypto algorithms that are hopefully ultimately going to come out of the post Quantum crypto competition that they had been hosting I know that that Mike and Mary and others have already started pursuing crypto agility they&apos;ve been doing some prototyping and we can discuss that further perhaps they can. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:   Gus it further but clearly. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  The need for crypto agility the ability to be able to swap in new algorithms over time and all of the king material the parameters the the inputs and the outputs that go along with that is probably number one on the list. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  Number two when it comes to government use of these Technologies and the underlying crypto it&apos;s the use of validated crypto algorithms and modules there is a program by which such algorithms and modules can can be validated it&apos;s not a trivial Endeavor it takes some time and. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  There are some modules that are out there that have been algorithms and modules that have been evaluated improved and there are others that probably would need to be in order to be sufficient for government use and would love to discuss that further with all of you to get a better idea as to what you&apos;re currently using what if any experience you have with the US government. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  Validation programs and and just have that discussion number three this was my number for yesterday but I&apos;m going to make it my number three today and that is pay attention to bit strength pay attention because that that&apos;s sort of drives the security level of the algorithms that you&apos;re using and depending on whether you&apos;re using it for four hash or Mac or signature or. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  There&apos;s going to be different different levels than this guidance and we excerpted some of this in the tables in the report and in the slides there&apos;s guidance on on the bit strength that you need to have in order to ensure appropriate security and back to item one the crypto agility all these strengths apply now to the current algorithm sweets right so things like SHS, SHA-3 AES DSS but as we transition in the future to public key cryptography we&apos;re going to have to pay attention to the bit strengths of those algorithms as well. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  Top five number four is what I&apos;ll refer to is sort of keeping track of the keying material or memory management so there were a number of recommendations that talk about treating the different Randomness seeds other parameters just like you would the king material itself generate it use it and then destroy it. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  The more of an attack surface over time it presents the more susceptible it is to being attacked through various vulnerabilities or exploits oh so you want to pay attention you know consciously to sort of the I&apos;ll call the life cycle of that material from the moment it&apos;s created until the moment that it&apos;s destroyed and then finally number five is. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  As you write various standards whether it be the base standards or some of the axillary or supplementary standards the glue standards whatever the case might be make sure that your documentation fully addresses the use of crypto and includes all of the different areas that we recommended in that are mentioned here in the top five list. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  Its strength recommendations for proper handling of keying material and discussion of potential government needs or requirements I think one of the things that&apos;s important to recall from what we presented last week is even though this is primarily the government compliance is primarily for for their purposes and meeting fisma requirements and and that in turn requires the use of. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  So number five very important to document I&apos;ll also point out one of the challenges Nick Jenice my collaborator and I had when we were going through the V CDM and did standards was trying to find the references to nist Photography in fact we found that there weren&apos;t necessarily references in this cryptography there were references to other w3c documents to other ietf documents and then those documents in turn had references. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:   Has to various other documents and we were. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">David Balenson</span>:  Only after some time and Care able to trace to the nest crypto documents themselves and people who were on saw the presentation last week may recall the graphs that we had shown where we traced all that so I think part of documenting crypto is also being more explicit about the crypto including the use of government flying compliant crypto including the use of NE standards. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
