Topic: VC-EDU Mailing List

Now have a VC-EDU mailing list
Kerri Lemoie: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-edu/
Main VC list is very technical, but education has conversations 
  related to education and conversations don't have to be as 
  technical. Technical issues should got to CCG mailing list. Idea 
  is to inform and engage as many as possible.
Kerri Lemoie: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/

At second link is updated charter
Comment this week, comments will be discussed next week.
Today won't go into detail, but to touch on some sections.
First, note history of LER Wrapper. Demonstration of how you can 
  wrap VC in an LER wrapper. Technical challenges turned out to be 
  great.
Not just content inside an envelope but also verification within 
  the envelope. That was challenging.
Scope hasn't changed. While LER wrapper was one idea, other ideas 
  can be explored.
Number 4 in scope was added, is also addressed by VC-edu mailing 
  list.
Please comment on scope so these can be discussed.
Deb Everhart: Question about scope: Education credentials, but it 
  also says occupational credentials. Important to include ed and 
  training everywhere, including on the job, or recognize the 
  collaboration of colleges with employers.
"Occupational" was meant to include any kind of credential.
Deb Everhart:  Important to draw a line between occupation and 
  education/training, or other documented learning experiences 
  should be in the scope of this work.
Deb Everhart:  Scope could be made more explicit about HR, 
  workforce development, etc., not just colleges and universities.
Phil Archer:  Good scope observation. Concern of proliferation of 
  groups talking about this. It is worth remembering that this 
  group is part of the VC standards work. Thus should include some 
  who are more technical. In other groups, there might be people 
  concerned with adoption, for example, and not so much with the 
  standards.
Phil Archer:  So there will be other groups talking about this, 
  there will be lines between these discussions, but keep focused 
  on the strengths of this group.
Kerrie: The external groups section was updated in order to note 
  the other organizations that we ought to have communication with.
Kerrie: Use case focus is important. Everything we do should be 
  covered by a use case. We may be writing use cases that are 
  theoretical but important to have these in the list.
Kerrie: We want others to look to this group for VCed standards. 
  We want a VCed context file whereas others can have their own 
  standards files.
<phil_l_(p1)> For example - there will be two workgroups in the 
  LERN community, one addressing Adoption and Barriers to it for 
  VCs,  and another associated with presentation scenarios.  We 
  (LERN) will have specific projects with project plans & 
  deliverables in a reasonably short time frame (3-5 months). The 
  latter WG is about how Holders leverage self-issued credentials & 
  possible approaches by which these can be verifiably endorsed.
Kerrie: We have a lot of properties out there that are useful. 
  Look at the approaches to interoperability for detail on how VCed 
  is meant to be positioned.
<phil_l_(p1)> LERN Meeting Sept. 27th, 2021, 3:30 pm - 4:30 pm, 
  at

Kerrie: Section on Work Items Process was put in to emphasize 
  that chairs can't do all of the work. There should be different 
  sub-groups working on issues. There could be other orgs that want 
  to work on issues related.  The sub-group must have at least two 
  working on every sub issue.
Kerrie: Opportunity for other orgs to take the lead on this work.
Kerrie: I added all the other educational standards groups that I 
  could think of.
Kerrie: Deliverables are pretty generic.
Kerrie: Some work needs to be done on the work plans.
<phil_l_(p1)> Whoohoo!
<john_kuo> :+1:
<timothy_summers> :+1:
<deb_everhart> happy but feeling a little overwhelmed
Kerrie: Please spend some time reading this and add comments. 
  Email me if you want to talk about it.

Kerri Lemoie:  We have two work items. Link in chat.
Kerri Lemoie:  Link at top to CCG work items. We have a ways to 
  go to fill this out. I'm sure many have use cases that are not in 
  the document or the repo yet.
Kerri Lemoie:  Look at the guidelines for use cases. We have a 
  form to submit use cases.
Kerri Lemoie:  Second work item is the "modeling educational 
  verifiable credentials" section of the Work items draft.
<phil_l_(p1)> The HR Open community is adhering to the VC Data 
  Model for it's work in the Resume Group, as well.
Kerri Lemoie:  Open to discussion, anything missing? Ideally I'd 
  like to see this model doc completed by end of year.
Phil Archer:  HR Open is trying to look at credentials in 
  structured way that represent employer/employee relationship. JDX 
  was handed over to HR Open and has become the job description 
  template (JSON data model as well).  Andrew Consolo, resume 
  workgroup (or recruitment workgroup), looks at what job 
  candidates should be submitted to job portals as JSON structured 
  documents. Whether to include in the same VC free text narrative, 
  or whether that would be separate in the context of a 
  presentation.
<phil_barker> (as I understand it) HR Open Recruitment is the 
  workgroup, resume/CV is the current task they are working on.
Phil Archer:  Most recently, how might endorsement for on-the-job 
  learning work? There is workgroup looking at this.
Phil Archer:  Phil Barker sits on that group as well.
Phil Barker:  Name of the workgroup is HR Open Recruitment.
<phil_l_(p1)> Thanks for the clarification
Deb Everhart:  A question of who is the "they." Having Phil and 
  Phil on these different workgroups is valuable.
Kerri Lemoie:  Please sign up for the mailing list.
