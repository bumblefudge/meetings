<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Kerri Lemoie</span>:  Basically reflection of the specification and as you implement a 3.0 you can test against this they from what I can tell pretty much in sync that they make adjustments to the schema and they happen in the specification somewhat automatically I think so I&apos;m this is something worth knowing and then we&apos;re also going to look at the sample open badge this is their basic very basic sample. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Kerri Lemoie</span>:  Example that we&apos;re going to use for breakfast also going to be very simple and we&apos;re not going to be looking to adding for instance like alignments to competencies and that type of thing right we&apos;re going to be looking at issuing a verifiable credential in the form of an open badge from one issuer or from an issuer to a wallet right so it&apos;s about transporting and displaying an open badge as part of the plugfest. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
