[2023-09-19T16:02:57.422Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Hi everyone so welcome to this week's at w3c ccg meeting today we're going to have a very exciting topic a little bit different usually we talk about the IDS decentralised identifiers verifiable credentials and things like that today we're going to talk about authentication which is basically a the linkage doing the physical and virtual self and we got an expert here David wait the principal technical architect of hidden identity to lead the.
[2023-09-19T16:02:57.875Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang:  discussion of Fido and one of them so before we.
[2023-09-19T16:03:16.343Z]	<Wendy_Seltzer>	present+
[2023-09-19T16:03:28.836Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Just want to do something quick and then stuff the first of all just want to do a quick reminder of the code of ethics and professional conduct just want to make sure that we have a fruitful discussion here and hold a respectful conversation all right anyone can participate in these calls Harbor also extensive contributions to a nice easy walk items must be members of the ccg with for IPR agreements signed so if you.
[2023-09-19T16:03:29.217Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang:  have any.
[2023-09-19T16:03:40.073Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: In regards to how you do that or if you have problems sign up for the w3c account just reach out to any of the cultures.
[2023-09-19T16:04:11.439Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: These calls are being recorded and the meeting minutes are automatically transcribed so we publish these meeting minutes and audio recordings GitHub about within a day or two basically within the week at the latest we use teach each a2q speakers during the call so you can type in cubed plus to add yourself to the cube or q- to remove.
[2023-09-19T16:04:15.923Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Like you just type in Q question mark.
[2023-09-19T16:04:32.584Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: All right so that that's go to that introduction so and reintroduction so if you are new to the community or if you haven't been active and want to kind of introduce yourself a little bit feel please feel free to just me.
[2023-09-19T16:04:50.095Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: I see mostly familiar faces so if you're feeling a little bit shy toward the editor we got time feel free to just be yourself.
[2023-09-19T16:04:57.609Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Alright announcement and reminders any announcements and or reminders.

[2023-09-19T16:05:39.463Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: So on October 10th that's the week of the internet identity Workshop we will be holding a special hybrid open house session and IW so that will be 12 p.m. Pacific Time 3 p.m. eastern time so Kimberly will be outside in Mountain View and holding a hybrid open house session and people get join online I'll special I'll send out the email about it.
[2023-09-19T16:05:39.799Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang:  the week prior so.
[2023-09-19T16:05:47.255Z]	<DavidC>	present+
[2023-09-19T16:05:58.283Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: That time will be a little bit different because the our regular nine nine o'clock Pacific time kind of coincides with open circle discussions during the IW so that will be pushed to noontime Pacific Time or 3 p.m. eastern time.
[2023-09-19T16:06:03.116Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: By any other announcement organizers.

[2023-09-19T16:06:36.452Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: So click preview of what's coming so next week we'll have not money and kind of talk about the selected disclosure for data integrity and the week after that we'll talk about proof of possessions at the application layer by Mike Jones and then the week after that will be IW special hybrid open house session and then the week after that would be selective disclosure mechanisms different selected disclosure methods.
[2023-09-19T16:06:39.101Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Don't be led by Ori.
[2023-09-19T16:06:47.399Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: All right any other announcements or reminders.

[2023-09-19T16:06:55.375Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Yeah updates on the work items.
[2023-09-19T16:07:08.990Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: All right before we get to manage Enda last calls for introductions for introductions announcements reminders work items.
[2023-09-19T16:07:42.574Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_IdentityWoman: Sorry internet identity Workshop is coming up October 10 through 12 and it was finally confirmed this morning there will be an open Wallet Foundation pre IW workshop at 9:00 a.m. 9:00 to 11:00 30 something like that maybe it's at 11:51 happening nearby IW the venue is in chosen yet but those of you interested in the.
[2023-09-19T16:07:43.039Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_IdentityWoman:  and wallet.
[2023-09-19T16:08:06.610Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_IdentityWoman: An excellent opportunity to hear about the code that is already contributed and also an interactive part of the event where everyone who's there will get to contribute what they are doing that may be related or what they hope can happen with the foundation and its work.
[2023-09-19T16:08:11.987Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Sounds good thank you.
[2023-09-19T16:08:17.746Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: The on her last announcements were reminders.

[2023-09-19T16:08:24.546Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_IdentityWoman: Sorry I'll just say that I'll send a link to the registration when it opens hopefully before the next one of these calls to the list.
[2023-09-19T16:08:28.184Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Great thank you.

[2023-09-19T16:09:02.475Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: All right let's get to the main agenda so today very very happy and also very glad that David from peeing identity is able to take the time to present and lead a discussion on Fido and web often I think he'll go into what Phi do I wipe off that means and what are the differences later but it's a very important standard that's being adopted across all the major browser platforms that.
[2023-09-19T16:09:02.909Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang:  will contribute to more secure Authentication.
[2023-09-19T16:09:11.227Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Ends and accessing our accounts Beyond just password so without further Ado David the floor is yours.
[2023-09-19T16:09:21.008Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Yeah thank you for having me I was advised to turn my video off once I start presenting just want to say hello to everyone and I hope you enjoyed the presentation.
[2023-09-19T16:09:56.341Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Okay so when we talking about Fido the final weigh-ins and also the web authentication specifications which are created within the w3c I'm going to be talking about trying to talk a bit about how they fit into the larger credentials ecosystem that seemed appropriate for this group a little bit more details on how the system works I'll try to walk through step by step.
[2023-09-19T16:09:56.651Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  but also get a bit of an.
[2023-09-19T16:10:14.929Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Even the current state and some of the challenges because I suspect that's an area where people come into this field have to do a bit more research there's a lot of momentum and a little bit of a directional shift that have happened in the last will say year.
[2023-09-19T16:10:46.516Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Don't myself work on various standards Ping Identity we do on-prem and hosted mostly Federated identity an MFA although we have access control we also have new identity verification and essential as identity products I participate in web on 10 I'm also Vice chair over on the private to side that's working on the kind of.
[2023-09-19T16:10:47.304Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  adware protocols.
[2023-09-19T16:11:04.772Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Focuses more on privacy approaches and Technologies how can we you know make sure that the technology doesn't leak information or enable people to be tracked even if you know social realities still would.
[2023-09-19T16:11:39.183Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Into the specification landscape web authentication or often just called Web authentic is working group I believe it started in 2017 and its focus is on the client-side API so how do I as the web page also known as relying party how am I able to interact through the browser and do stronger Authentication.
[2023-09-19T16:11:39.555Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  this is done by bees.
[2023-09-19T16:12:11.480Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Those devices or software that perform authentication called authenticators which create an assert credentials so the one of the fundamentals is that there's no inherent like a federation where you have an existing account that shared a website after this is I want to use this system I want to get a.
[2023-09-19T16:12:12.059Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  credential in this case it's actually.
[2023-09-19T16:12:20.476Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Public-private key based in order to be able to prove it's the same user again in the future.
[2023-09-19T16:12:37.460Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: This is also you know by virtue of being w3c has user consent as part of the process it's meant to identify or authenticator should say people not machines and.
[2023-09-19T16:12:44.373Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Have to be done so with with their knowledge of what's going on since that's pretty strong tracking vector.
[2023-09-19T16:13:13.655Z]	<Nikos_Fotiou>	present+
[2023-09-19T16:13:16.446Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: The API itself supports both primary authentication as well as secondary secondary being the historical source of specifications and it relates to fight oh because Fido specifies the kind of Hardware protocols how do you work over USB in the like but also can be provided by software either provided within the platform itself like Windows hello or via third party.
[2023-09-19T16:13:49.446Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: I think one password may have actually really something this week that spective defines all the exchanges and also the format since they're cryptographically protected it also defines the extensibility mechanisms although there's caveat sand that browsers typically want to know what extensions are being supported so that they know the Privacy impacts of those so there's typically an allowed list of what extensions are a lot.
[2023-09-19T16:13:50.036Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  loud even if the Authenticator.
[2023-09-19T16:13:57.439Z]	<Nikos_Fotiou>	present+
[2023-09-19T16:14:23.504Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: A clean way little bit because there's a lot of different options within web authentic there's this concept of discoverability so this is I come with the browser of cleared all cookies I've cleared everything can a website use this API to just say try to authenticate the user if I have if there's been any sort of previous relationship I can't see that as website because of privacy I need you.
[2023-09-19T16:14:24.148Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  you to tell me does the user want to talk.
[2023-09-19T16:14:55.043Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: But I don't know who this so you need to have all the state necessary for tracking within the client within the authenticators what sort of relationships have already been established older school u2f what started Run 2013 and it's kind of the the source for webathon didn't have any storage so it wasn't capable of working this way so you either call these non discoverable or non-resident.
[2023-09-19T16:15:27.946Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: That was only useful for a second Factor really because one you traffic doesn't provide a way of any doing any sort of additional checks on who the person is but also you had to provide a list of handles and those handles were typically cryptographic information either seed values or wrapped credentials because those that Hardware was limited had no local storage.
[2023-09-19T16:15:28.344Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  the out pinning of this.
[2023-09-19T16:15:48.744Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: That discover one on discoverable credentials formed the basis of primary factor and second Factor authentication so are you supplementing something like a username and password or are you trying to get like a fully pastoralist even potentially user nameless experience.
[2023-09-19T16:16:20.805Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Concept called user presents this is a gesture showing that you as a user intend to authenticate that could be a button on a piece of Hardware or on a software user interface or could be the action of taking the piece of hardware and bring it close to a NFC Reader but that only shows that you have possession of the key and nowadays that may or may not even mean that it's a hardware Factor so there's an.
[2023-09-19T16:16:21.079Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  list additional concept called user.
[2023-09-19T16:16:51.735Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Occation authenticator controls the mechanism but it's way in the API to request that additional checks be performed so very diverse potential ecosystem of authenticators that could be a pinhead on a piece of Hardware it could be an activation code being gathered by the users web browser platform to unlock a piece of Hardware it could be a biometric sensor built directly.
[2023-09-19T16:16:52.086Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  and without.
[2023-09-19T16:17:06.645Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Is that your doing additional verification that's isn't just a piece of Hardware found in the street that this is set up in a way to actually verify the user.
[2023-09-19T16:17:39.247Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: If I don't liance little bit older than the website then effort started in 2013 with a overarching goal of reducing you know ideally eliminating passwords and replacing them with stronger authentication mechanisms a lot of their initial Focus was around there being lots of inventions for stronger authentication there were Biometrics being built into laptops for instance.
[2023-09-19T16:18:11.701Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: One of these had a different integration strategy and so widespread adoption you just wasn't going to happen you know it's the purview of browser plugins and integration on a site by site basis so they started the uaf protocol which was a primary factor for interfacing with hardware and software authenticators Google and Yuba code contributed.
[2023-09-19T16:18:12.160Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  adieu to F which was.
[2023-09-19T16:18:43.463Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: For second factor which actually wound up being coming the underpinning for web authentication see tap to which added back on top of that the idea of being primary factor by adding that additional memory and so the see tap to spec underneath the final alliances describing the hardware interactions it also defines something called a hybrid transport if you've tried web.
[2023-09-19T16:18:43.766Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  then and.
[2023-09-19T16:18:53.232Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Selected you want to try other mechanisms and you get a qr-code pop up which I can probably show at the end if people like.
[2023-09-19T16:19:24.401Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: That's actually being defined by fight alliances well and that's Mitch these are basically meant to be not tighter like a particular ecosystem or a particular piece of Hardware or a particular vendor for being cross-device cross-platform mechanisms for authenticating and then if you ever hear the term fito to its kind of umbrella almost marketing term for the combination of what with ahead and see tab.
[2023-09-19T16:19:57.340Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: People probably heard the term passkeys if they've looked at this space saying that a pesky is an alternative to a password is probably the best way to put it because it's not really meant to be a technical term it's more of a conceptual term it's more of how do we explain this concept to your average consumer in a way we're not really having to teach them something new or just leveraging their.
[2023-09-19T16:19:57.766Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  Ting knowledge.
[2023-09-19T16:20:03.986Z]	<Nikos_Fotiou>	present+
[2023-09-19T16:20:28.273Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Put passwords are and just saying this is a better alternative if you were to map that to technical term would be the that idea of those discoverable credentials that you can go to a website with no prior configuration on your local machine just that prior registration of an authenticator and login so you don't have to type in a username you don't have to do a lot of things the the.
[2023-09-19T16:20:55.447Z]	<BC>	present+
[2023-09-19T16:21:00.371Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Pharmacist and helping you authenticate and they provide that as kind of a consistent interface across different platforms across different websites that want to use this technology for the authenticators underneath it's really matter of user choice that one's it being pretty diverse set it could be that existing Hardware that could be done rolling platform so functionality built in like Windows hello or it could be.
[2023-09-19T16:21:04.381Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Relatively new idea of a third-party piece of software.
[2023-09-19T16:21:20.035Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So you know the lot of these are password managers getting into the space although there are some Enterprise piece of software that also want to provide very specific capabilities.
[2023-09-19T16:21:50.841Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: All this talking about why it's better than a password this is kind of the minimum bar expectation of how those are better that one is tracking resistance so while using the same email address as your username across sites is going to enable tracking at that level that is that these credentials are.
[2023-09-19T16:21:51.237Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  R generate a.
[2023-09-19T16:22:21.816Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: It's per site so each site gets its own unique key in those can't be used to crawl it you likewise when I visit a website like a retailer or social network they don't actually see I have any credentials at all registered until I give consent in the form of an authentication prompt and even then again it's still just proof that I'm the same person they've seen previously and have.
[2023-09-19T16:22:54.659Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Registered a credential with so it's somewhat up here authentication Factor another is reach resistance so since this is all based on public key cryptography even if the you know backup of the credential database table gets leaked that it doesn't actually enable any sort of exploits so a lot more resilient to people having to go and change passwords on a bunch of other websites because the right if you use the same password.
[2023-09-19T16:22:55.074Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  awkward and one of those sites got.
[2023-09-19T16:23:25.879Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Typically doesn't happen they just have more of their identities exploited the third one is strong fish and resistance so since these credentials are per site and since the browser is actively mediating and providing a channel there's a kind of a DNS binding of those credentials the cryptographic protocol was scribes the party that it's communicating with so.
[2023-09-19T16:23:56.314Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So as strong as the DNS and POS infrastructure of the web itself so much stronger fishing resistance email campaigns sitting new to the wrong website won't really succeed in capturing a credential you in fact won't even be prompted to supply the credential because the browser knows what it is and isn't supposed to be doing there.
[2023-09-19T16:24:32.247Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So where's this in the credential ecosystem little hesitant in this group to talk too much about what is or isn't a credential but these are pair wise so they're not meant to be Global men There's issues with using something like an identity credentials likes a driver's license for authentication in some cases that might be appropriate like the actual issuing authority or overarching government has.
[2023-09-19T16:24:32.630Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  as assurances there that there's.
[2023-09-19T16:25:04.558Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: This is there are certain actions that they can accept that risk whereas someone else may not know that identifiers or stable or not what they move whether they move to a different state whether they have another identity issue and have numbers rotated or have any sort of action they can take the turns out that credentials issued fraudulently so.
[2023-09-19T16:25:05.037Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  being paralyzed.
[2023-09-19T16:25:35.688Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: The big benefit for an authentication credential likewise it doesn't represent any sort of certification or qualification it doesn't really have any identity attributes whatsoever nor does it represent any sort of personal Authority or authorization it is just authentication just previously I registered this I'm the same party as I was at that point.
[2023-09-19T16:26:07.975Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Happy Hearts there's attestation so especially as you get more into regulated space you want to know how that user verification is performed you also may want to know the security properties of that key so for instance is the are the credentials cloneable and there are mechanisms now for doing additional data storage at time of registration which are used for things like say taking.
[2023-09-19T16:26:08.352Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  the underlying credential and.
[2023-09-19T16:26:13.071Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Get into like x.509 certificate form.
[2023-09-19T16:26:47.027Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So part in the white slide but this talks a bit about the parties involved so you have the end-user you have the client which is typically a web browser you have the authenticator which actually does the authentication process any of the relying party which is kind of in two parts since the JavaScript API you're typically not trying to.
[2023-09-19T16:26:47.562Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  authenticate the user.
[2023-09-19T16:27:21.015Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Purpose of the script running inside the browser you're typically trying to get access to improve that it's the user to say some sort of back-end system this is changing slightly with some new extensions that are coming but you generally have that kind of division at the relying party where it's kind of the front end and the back end so the process is very similar whether you're registering a credential.
[2023-09-19T16:27:21.774Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  in the first time or are using it again.
[2023-09-19T16:27:53.921Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: That the user initiates the client browser there's some sort of part of the presentation webpage to kick off the process ruling party usually wants to have its own interactive challenge so it fetches that that gets baked into a robot then request at the JavaScript level and then that gets turned by the client into this case a CPAP request.
[2023-09-19T16:27:54.375Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  and that goes to that piece.
[2023-09-19T16:28:24.276Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: I will say over USB it does in step five a check for user presents or verification like see it has a biometric and that creeps cryptographic response that gets sent back through the client to the JavaScript within the client and then on to say that the back end of the line party to actually perform Authentication.

[2023-09-19T16:28:41.409Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So talking a bit about the current state of things.
[2023-09-19T16:29:13.324Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So the markets pain devil is evolving quite a bit of the last year while Apple had things in preview for a couple of years prior last year was really the start of passkeys their public facing system-wide credential system and think ability it was also when Google added passkeys to.
[2023-09-19T16:29:13.613Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  to the Android platform.
[2023-09-19T16:29:44.717Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So adding describable credentials unifying around kind of that terminology it really change the position of the market before it was say very low double digits or single digits adoption insights where you know it's not a closed system where say an Enterprise's giving credentials to people.
[2023-09-19T16:30:15.811Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Telling them that they need to use them to having the ability to do what about then the actual authenticator to do it not just browser support for interaction being pretty much ubiquitous and this caused a bit of growing pains especially in regulated industries that adopted webathon early because these platforms have different security properties the big one is recover ability and sinking.
[2023-09-19T16:30:16.206Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  I'm so.
[2023-09-19T16:30:46.818Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Mobile phone vendor isn't going to want people to lose their ability to log into every website when they buy a new phone or replace the phone that was lost or stolen however that means that you're no longer really interacting with the security Factor you're interacting with an authentication process behind that authenticator boundary and that makes things a lot harder for people to reason about when they need to understand the risk and how the.
[2023-09-19T16:30:47.235Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  this fulfills.
[2023-09-19T16:31:16.029Z]	<Chandi_Cumaranatunge>	present+
[2023-09-19T16:31:17.707Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Their regulatory requirements so bit of growing pains there however there has been significant investment on kind of the unregulated consumer space and adoption there there's been several rounds of iterative user experience refinements there's been greater adoption of the passkey kind of terminology also relatively recently there's been plenty.
[2023-09-19T16:31:18.073Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  that forms the.
[2023-09-19T16:31:49.481Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: The software at a system level similar to how you have autofill from password managers today at a system level so a lot of the consumer password managers are seeking to become a ski providers and to integrate either within the browser at that system level to provide people an alternative with you know different properties that's again meant to be more of a diverse ecosystem where you know say.
[2023-09-19T16:31:50.066Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  a piece of.
[2023-09-19T16:32:02.218Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: You Linux or having a open database might be very compelling for some people and not really that interesting for others.
[2023-09-19T16:32:34.579Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So with this a lot of the metaphors have been aligning more with password managers and that kind of go along with that minimal level of assurances that you can get from passkeys which is that compared to passwords that has better security properties fishing resistance tracking resistance and resistance in the face of compromise.
[2023-09-19T16:32:35.390Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  so that kind of breach list.
[2023-09-19T16:33:06.416Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Passwords we've seen the user experience aligning more with autofill Behavior at login so this is nice because one of the biggest problems with technology adoption is how do you educate the user does every party that wants to use the system have to take some responsibility for educating the user so having it in the platform having a.
[2023-09-19T16:33:06.999Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  Zur meeting.
[2023-09-19T16:33:23.047Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: That but really only shows up if they've already opted into using the pass key system that really reduces the amount of Education needed especially on see the homepage of the website and.
[2023-09-19T16:33:42.780Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Not having likes it model prompts that people have to figure out what the system's even talking about definitely reduces the chance of churn that adopting this technology would cause people to just decide they don't want to deal with it right now and to leave the website all together.
[2023-09-19T16:34:01.343Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: The hope is as uptake improves as we kind of see wider spread adoption further ux improvements that relying parties don't feel the need to explain what pass keys are to the users what are they don't have to explain what a password is today.
[2023-09-19T16:34:35.194Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So in progress the standards you have web authentication level 3 so this it's referred to as conditionally mediated UI for that kind of Auto form fill Behavior providing more information about the same credentials for websites this is really meant for rejecting the credential this is meant so website understands is this a piece of Hardware where if they misplaced.
[2023-09-19T16:34:35.519Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  face it they.
[2023-09-19T16:34:35.595Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Be able to.
[2023-09-19T16:35:06.387Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Access my website at all or is this something like something backed by a cloud account where if the user has a lost or stolen phone they can recover access and be able to achieve kind of account recovery on that end so what is the burden and the site and they might use this knowledge to decide for instance whether or not they give user to completely eliminate password login options.
[2023-09-19T16:35:06.761Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  there's a little Ben.
[2023-09-19T16:35:37.543Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Number of quality of life improvements one of my favorite is that the robot then data a lot of its binary being cryptic messages one of those messages actually go all the way back to you to F so that there's compatibility with some pretty old like 10 plus year old Hardware at this point and unfortunately a lot of the burden and dealing with those binary messages and and how to coordinate with like a back-end system fell on.
[2023-09-19T16:35:37.986Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  in JavaScript.
[2023-09-19T16:36:09.467Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Of like if you bought a product that have their own libraries for how do you interact between that back-end server and your webpage well in what about them level 3 there's now a Json formats there's API built in to convert between kind of the API configuration or responses and to be able to get Json and use that for API calls to a back-end system and.
[2023-09-19T16:36:09.789Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  with a lot of as.
[2023-09-19T16:36:20.058Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: A lot of ongoing web standards many of the features are already deployed so the conditionally mediated you is already been in browsers for over a year.
[2023-09-19T16:36:51.449Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Kind of its companion over in fight alliances he tap 2.2 the sets that hybrid QR code based Bluetooth based web socket based mechanism that some of you may have seen and this is really meant to go cross device so how can I login to my desktop using my cellphone and credentials they created their or even cross ecosystem so how do I.
[2023-09-19T16:36:57.648Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Sign into a Windows desktop using my Android phone.
[2023-09-19T16:37:33.877Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So a lot of this comes down to and by Nature being in the w3c and and having this investment by browsers and platforms to being backed by an open-world model where it's really the users choice in what authenticator they use and then the relying party is meant to evaluate how well that meets the requirements for some sites just being able to get fishing resistance and to get some of.
[2023-09-19T16:37:34.694Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  the properties they would normally have to do.
[2023-09-19T16:38:06.088Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: P we're out of an authenticator is as great and other regulated environments the base level might not be enough and the ruling party may need to do additional Factor prompts and that's the public internet for you know for private parties like Enterprises or government to employer government to contractor there may be much further restrictions even going down to saying I.
[2023-09-19T16:38:06.721Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  I don't just want to use this.
[2023-09-19T16:38:18.965Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Need to use one that came from our ordered batch with the proper serial number with the proper configuration so that information is reported to us.
[2023-09-19T16:38:52.476Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Um that's really private parties public-facing including those in regulated Industries are expected to honor the users choice and and not reject some because it became from a particular platform or because it doesn't have a particular capability and a lot of that is both to prevent any sort of early adopter Advantage but also to really allow for a diverse ecosystem where.
[2023-09-19T16:38:53.056Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  you know say someone has accessibility needs.
[2023-09-19T16:39:12.403Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: An authenticator can be built specifically for their use without having to see go and get approval from the top 100 200 300 websites of the internet who have decided to Institute an allowed list.
[2023-09-19T16:39:44.136Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: But this goes counter to at the stations so the idea of how you know that say it's back to a particular piece of hardware by a vendor that has particular security properties so if I have safety security key fob that I'm selling into an Enterprise environment at the stations are great that meets the customers requirements that's part of the reason they're purchasing the.
[2023-09-19T16:40:15.276Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: From soccer based authenticator I had different motivations I don't want to have fingerprinting I don't want say websites on the internet decided that since password manager had a breach that that Pastor manager from this point forward will never be acceptable on a particular website is kind of a brand of penalty and you know in the web space we've seen what's happened.
[2023-09-19T16:40:15.644Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  and with say.
[2023-09-19T16:40:46.213Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: It strains and how you know a lot of browsers wind up lying either baking in the names of other browsers for regular expression purposes or having a quirks mode where they just say this is the value I have to return on this website in order for my users to have access however it is widely recognized that there's a gap between that Enterprise environment and say.
[2023-09-19T16:41:19.379Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Character enthusiasts Forum in regulated Industries such as Banks and health care where they may have requirements that the the base level does not satisfy and that makes it hard for them to adopt the system because they typically already have complex authentication processes that they feel to meet their needs so a better alternative to passwords may not be worth the cognitive load it may not.
[2023-09-19T16:41:19.788Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  be worth instituting.
[2023-09-19T16:41:51.899Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Another option for one part of the authentication process especially if they're going to be passkeys and then turn around and Reliance of like SMS to try to do a uniqueness constraint and that case they're adopting this and it's not actually solving even any other business costs so it's a known Gap there's active areas but it's also an area where the different parties have very different needs.
[2023-09-19T16:41:52.297Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  different worries different goals.
[2023-09-19T16:42:23.263Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Active research and development it is moving slower than I think anyone will like but this is why most of the software base and platform-based authenticators that have come out in the last year don't have at the station says because there's not really a desire to have people locked into particular platform to have websites decided they just aren't going to accept.
[2023-09-19T16:42:44.828Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Particular items so they've been a little bit of Anonymous in terms of how that credentials being source with backing authenticator is so I can speak a little bit to those in Q&A which I believe.
[2023-09-19T16:42:45.375Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q?
[2023-09-19T16:42:45.438Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  we're now at.
[2023-09-19T16:42:49.626Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: If people would like.
[2023-09-19T16:43:14.170Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Any questions for David by the way I have one question so earlier in your slides you mentioned that the web platforms have adopted their level one web application and then you describe the level of 3 so the natural question is like what is level 2 and then is there a level four.
[2023-09-19T16:43:39.470Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So so level one was the initial version level to had a lot of kind of adoption features more focused on Enterprise adoption so it added things like Enterprise at two stations this would be how with either machine policy so say a Windows or other emm policy or via policy on the hardware key itself.
[2023-09-19T16:44:10.766Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Identify internal websites and perhaps release more information than people would normally be comfortable with such as a serial number so if I use antibiotics key on an Enterprise site maybe a uniquely identifies the key and so they can track what your batch it came from which employee was issued to definitely not what they want for Seattle stations on the public internet in fact final lines the certification.
[2023-09-19T16:44:11.306Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  and one of the other.
[2023-09-19T16:44:43.345Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: At the station and say I think 50,000 or 100,000 device batches so you can kind of tell which weeks say yubikey was manufactured in but you can't get too many bits of information about a particular user based on the key that's being used Enterprise environment very different requirements so how do you opt in t tab 2.1 that's kind of the.
[2023-09-19T16:44:43.707Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  corresponding spec there and so it.
[2023-09-19T16:45:16.012Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Like if I if that key gets out of the employees control say they leave the company and they reset it and put it on eBay making sure that Enterprise policy is cleared out so it acts just the same as any other key from that manufacturer not something that has kind of a surface an unknown policy and that changes privacy characteristics so making sure certified devices have of.
[2023-09-19T16:45:16.336Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  reset policy that would clear out.
[2023-09-19T16:45:18.418Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: I was loaded on them.
[2023-09-19T16:45:51.529Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: That was level to a lot of cleanups a lot of areas where there was opportunity for improvement the discoverable credential it came from that and some of that was because in level 1 there was a residency term that Resident non-resident if it's in memory but it turns out that was really more the hardware roots from the sea tab side the u12 side and not really usability focused and.
[2023-09-19T16:45:51.892Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  and that actually cause some conflicts where.
[2023-09-19T16:46:24.465Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: On the Windows platform whatever you request it's always residents are always created by the Crypt of subsystem and always put onto a file system because storage is not a premium but those were actually meant to be usability terms and so websites would find out that they never meant for particular credential to be used some way but it was still showing up and say a list of the user even though.
[2023-09-19T16:46:24.850Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  will never work.
[2023-09-19T16:46:50.933Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Very inconsistent between authenticators and platforms that this new terminology came about in level 2 so there's a bit of more of a focus on what the behavior of things were supposed to be rather than what the hardware capability of things were supposed to be the browser's themselves had different levels of adoption so.
[2023-09-19T16:46:54.700Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Being a bit I believe they're not level 2.
[2023-09-19T16:47:12.594Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Which is in the current published spec and then level 3 I believe the goal is to have it go to see our early next year but we'll see where that is there's a lot of really interesting things that may wind up pushing it back.
[2023-09-19T16:47:19.280Z]	<Kaliya_IdentityWoman>	present+
[2023-09-19T16:47:31.821Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Got it and if you're a website like and trying to integrate with wipe off then you're just interacting with the platforms like apis right like why do you care about attestations of the hardware or different authenticators.
[2023-09-19T16:47:58.958Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So at the stations are kind of made to be a heavy lift or you can say some of that is implicit and you know optimizing for more the consumer cases some of it may be a little bit intentional because there's definitely an idea that for an open web model add two stations or something that they don't want a lot of people using just because there.
[2023-09-19T16:48:33.766Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: If all you want to do is about then to do basically Pass key is and you don't care about active stations you have a significantly smaller lift once you get into act two stations different Hardware May produce different formats that the station itself doesn't really prove much just kind of identifies the make and model so you'll have independent certification bodies like Fido Alliance that provide.
[2023-09-19T16:48:34.444Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  tables to kind of map that into capabilities.
[2023-09-19T16:49:07.141Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Students like you know this random number generator have a compromise or someone figured out how to exfiltrate information off of the key big kind of maintain certification levels and kind of active states of those keys but you kind of take all that if not on in order to consume active stations there's also some of this may go away in the future but.
[2023-09-19T16:49:07.874Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  there's currently also props to release those out to sea.
[2023-09-19T16:49:40.169Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: That is because it's hard to know that a non-conforming authenticated that hasn't gone through a certification process that they're not uniquely identifying the user but it's also just a little bit of an additional burden for people to take at the stations that if you don't need them you really shouldn't be asking for them and a lot of that comes back to that open mic model it just.
[2023-09-19T16:49:40.478Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  people don't want websites to say.
[2023-09-19T16:49:58.853Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: We're only going to accept this brand on the public internet they don't want to get to a point where someone has to carry 12 key fobs on their key ring and figure out which one gets into which website just because we're different security restrictions that quite honestly are arbitrary.
[2023-09-19T16:50:03.241Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q?
[2023-09-19T16:50:05.911Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Thanks any other questions.
[2023-09-19T16:50:25.862Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: And David you mind going a little bit deeper into kind of like the password recovery equivalent process right and also does the passkey you kind of have an expiration date and or does it is it like permanent.
[2023-09-19T16:50:52.226Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Sure so there's no key rotation process the ideas I can just register a new passkey and there's a user handle provided by the relying party so if the same authenticator gets a new credential with the same handle it just reads it just creates a new credential replaces the old one so.
[2023-09-19T16:51:23.264Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Rotation it just not really an expiry otherwise the relying party would have to make the determination that I kind of want a new one in terms of recovery so from a typical Hardware security key perspective there isn't any and that's been that was a huge adoption issue identify you know right up until a year ago that if I lose my security key then all of a sudden.
[2023-09-19T16:51:23.730Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  and I don't have a way to.
[2023-09-19T16:51:49.699Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: On WE authenticate these sites so if their whole purpose of adopting this was to get like a Al to say level of authentication you can't have recovery be the weakest link and so you know the whole water level went up an Enterprise so that you're not doing strong authentication with email magic link recovery but the.
[2023-09-19T16:52:20.937Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: So the guidance was well by multiple security keys and periodically go back at have websites support multiple passkeys and periodically go back and register your backup key from the safe with those various websites and this is you know even for someone in the security industry pretty difficult and so there was a proposal by yubico to.
[2023-09-19T16:52:21.331Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  have a protocol that's kind of a.
[2023-09-19T16:52:53.380Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Future introduction between keys where I could provide basically proof that Mikey was one that was mentioned in a previous registration or use there were some prototypes of that they didn't really get too much adoption issue interest mostly because every relying party would have to take the effort to support that new protocol and extension or else you know you were still at the same state where.
[2023-09-19T16:52:53.702Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  are there wasn't really any sort of built.
[2023-09-19T16:53:03.093Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  The platform's basically.
[2023-09-19T16:53:19.487Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: You treat passkeys as part of the sink fabric they have.
[2023-09-19T16:53:20.273Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Or passwords so the private keys are protected and synchronized in the cloud through whatever mechanism they have there were some improvements I believe to some of that some sir.
[2023-09-19T16:53:53.744Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Cloud HSM and you're really recovering access to use that cloud HSM but the idea where there was I still might get locked out because I might get at locked out of say my Google account or Apple account so you still need a recovery story but the recovery burden is written release reduced on the relying party because it's a much more exceptional flow rather than I hoped.
[2023-09-19T16:53:54.558Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  I updated a piece of hardware and now I realize it can never.
[2023-09-19T16:54:25.526Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Here at the same time the other part there is that whole hybrid that's in c-type 2.2 the cross-device authentication based on the QR codes and Bluetooth and a bunch of other things but the idea there is if I use my Android phone on my Windows desktop to get in a relying party could just offer it could detect that.
[2023-09-19T16:54:26.156Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  at and say.
[2023-09-19T16:54:58.643Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Don't you just add Windows hello so you don't have to go through this in the future assuming this isn't some sort of kiosk there's no reason you should have to use your phone to get into your desktop because we can just give your desktop access as well and so that also means that it kind of AIDS you and registering multiple credentials he had multiple ways back in so it none of that's a silver bullet you know nobody's invented the Silver Bullet solution.
[2023-09-19T16:54:59.104Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  for Recovery yet but every.
[2023-09-19T16:55:12.812Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Bird and then makes it so that recovery is a less often behavior and that therefore means that's going to be more scrutiny about it.
[2023-09-19T16:55:16.073Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Got it thanks for clarification.
[2023-09-19T16:55:48.838Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: I have a business question I got quite a bit of questions about I'm quite interesting this topic have a kind of business question I'm just curious like because you know the platforms like Chrome browsers like oh have passwords like password managers right and then he supports the web Athens and you know and then a Mac like it integrates with the touch IDs and things.
[2023-09-19T16:55:49.093Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang:  like that so I'm just curious.
[2023-09-19T16:55:58.649Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: The role of third-party password managers especially when the platforms already have have these features kind of baked in.
[2023-09-19T16:56:28.121Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: You know it's a lot of it is evolutionary speed so a company dedicated to building user-facing or family or say Enterprise facing password managers has more resources that they're probably willing to put on those products more desire to iterate and innovate.
[2023-09-19T16:57:01.869Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: You know someone very recent feature as a yesterday is that the Apple password manager added groups so that you could have a set of passwords and passkey shared with your family quite honestly I didn't think they would ever do that and it's not because it's not valuable is because I didn't know if it'd make the cut because there's a certain amount of cognitive load and there's ongoing support and from their perspective it's a feature not a product so.
[2023-09-19T16:57:02.385Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  so you know same with why would I.
[2023-09-19T16:57:34.289Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Additional software I think a lot of it is you know the ability to cater to the needs of your customers which may be different than the needs of everyone using pass keys and so having a consistent interface across platforms so knowing that works identical on singing Mac and on Android phone any support they have in the future for something like.
[2023-09-19T16:57:34.602Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite:  X which doesn't have a.
[2023-09-19T16:58:02.854Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Platform level feature for we'll both end and pass key is yet but I know there's people that have been looking into that you know all those sorts of things differentiate the the accessibility is a area I'm really interested in seeing what sort of you know very targeted Evolution could happen to help people with specific needs and.
[2023-09-19T16:58:21.444Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Freeze all ships that may become table Stakes when people realize oh this is excellent this is the baby should have done at all along but if you don't have more velocity and more experimentation than that realization may never happen.
[2023-09-19T16:58:43.279Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Thank you I think we're at time and I just want to say thank you big thank you again David for taking a time here to present in deep discussion and answer a bunch of my question that I have for a long time about by do a wipe off that but thanks a lot.

[2023-09-19T16:59:05.612Z]	<Transcriber>	David_Waite: Yeah and if you or anyone else has additional questions and kind of this space feel free to reach out you know there were it was talking the past of whether or not the act of stations that fire do created where usable for wallets generally don't think that's a great idea but.
