Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Mike Prorock: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2023Mar/0101.html
Mike Prorock:  All right all hello and welcome today we're going 
  to be talking about verifiable credentials did web and actual 
  practical useful stuff which is why I am sure the numbers are 
  lighter since there's less room for generalized commentary and we 
  actually are looking at grow real code that's the end of my snark 
  and that's purely from a personal observation level so we love to 
  talk to details.
Mike Prorock:   And just.
Mike Prorock: https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/
Mike Prorock:  I can hear first and foremost want to talk about 
  and mentioned that this meeting as with all meetings is covered 
  under the w3c code of ethics professional conduct really have a 
  good time here and never tend to have any issues with that but 
  just in case it's a handy reminder one note that this meeting is 
  a w3c community group meeting and as a result of that anyone can 
  participate in these competitions.
Mike Prorock:   Calls they are open to the.
Mike Prorock: https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/join
Mike Prorock:  Public however if you're going to do work if 
  you're going to contribute into w3c work items at this community 
  group you do need to be a member and you need that's primarily 
  for I pr reasons right to prevent any potential intellectual 
  property claims and nasty stuff that can come up down the line 
  should work proceed from here where we incubate work into 
  something like a working group we're working actually that gets 
  finished and standardized so just a note there we do take 
  meeting.
Mike Prorock:   Minutes as you are seeing go in the chat and 
  those recordings do get posted.
<mprorock> type “q+” to add yourself to the queue, with an 
  optional
Mike Prorock:  In the chat you may type Q the letter q and the 
  plus sign to add yourself to the queue or raise your hand that 
  stuff is sync up also work and I are see if you are on the IRC 
  channel for some reason.
Mike Prorock:  With that before we get into the main meeting do 
  you want to pause and see if there are any new folks to the call 
  that would like to introduce themselves.
Patrick_(IDLab): Hey guys I see here oh yeah I'll just give a 
  short introduction so I'm devops specialist I work for the 
  digital identity laboratory of Canada than in the digital 
  identity space for about two years now it's very very interesting 
  so we as a independent entity we pride ourselves in being 
  unbiased and really just observe the various.
Patrick_(IDLab):  us efforts that are being made.
Patrick_(IDLab): Here in Canada and internationally currently we 
  have a lot of interest a lot of traction and the hyper Ledger 
  side of things with Aries and a non credentials and what 
  provinces are doing in Canada for a digital identity which is 
  interesting regarding w3c I've been attending the VC API calls 
  for some time now with special focus on test.
Patrick_(IDLab):  sweets and testing and implementation.
<orie> yay! did:web for testing is excellent
Patrick_(IDLab): Ends and understanding how everything works I 
  was particularly interested in this call today because I am sort 
  of prototyping a proof of concept for a did web methods to manage 
  and on creds credential the a non-credit credential has been made 
  into its own sort of specification recently and we are exploring 
  branching out to different did methods for.
Patrick_(IDLab):  very interested in.
Patrick_(IDLab): Services parameters and also videos so hopefully 
  it will be an interesting call today for me.
Mike Prorock:  Cool well great to have you and yeah we're 
  definitely I'm particularly interested in the topic today as well 
  because I think it's a good one let's see here with that I'm 
  going to pause for any announcements or reminders for the from 
  the broader Community here so anything relevant to ccg from the 
  community before I start calling all the folks I am going to note 
  that there's been a good thread that I think Manny might have 
  started just given the fact that.
Mike Prorock:   That our GitHub is getting a little up in size 
  and probably.
Mike Prorock:  Place to store a bunch of audio video Etc so there 
  is some discussion of getting that stuff over to YouTube and 
  possibly backed up to Archive org and some other options so 
  chairs definitely will take that under consideration and it seems 
  like there's broad Community Support so we will figure out some 
  next steps there in our next chair meeting over the next two 
  weeks so I'm going to be traveling next week so it'll probably be 
  the week after.
Mike Prorock:   The with that.
Mike Prorock:  Any other announcements from the community side.
Mike Prorock:  Mr Manu.
Manu Sporny:  Hey oh geez I'm late and all Jesus was already 
  discussed it was announcement on the or there was a question on 
  the mailing list about whether or not we want to have a YouTube 
  channel and upload like these recordings that we're doing well 
  now to YouTube people have provide some feedback thanks for that 
  I'm guessing we'll leave it open the question open for another 
  week and then see what we want to do but if you have a.
Manu Sporny:  Please provide some input on the mailing list 
  that's it.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah definitely in a maniac I just noted will 
  probably sink up as chairs not this week coming up the following 
  after there's been some more time for that to bake and we've got 
  some good options but it looks like there's a rough consensus 
  driving at least in a certain direction to get some stuff out 
  there so thank you for starting that thread.
Mike Prorock:   Also many other announcements from.
<orie> fediverse / peer tube!
Mike Prorock:  That impact ccg wise otherwise I'm going to turn 
  the ball over to or a here I am a big fan of the federal workers 
  as you know or a so.
<bumblefudge> nic
<bumblefudge> e
Mike Prorock:  All right well Ori I'm going to hand it to you 
  topic of today is implementing did web for use with verifiable 
  credentials just a lovely topic yeah.
Orie Steele:  Yeah and as I recall if I turn my video on servers 
  melt right so maybe I don't turn the video.
Mike Prorock:  Screen share works great video I don't know so.
Orie Steele:  Right here how do I screen share in this thing 
  there's the button.
Orie Steele:  Tire scream I'll see my entire screen.
Mike Prorock:  We can indeed.
Orie Steele:  All right so the structure of this is presentation 
  I do have a demo at the end of it I can give that basically just 
  Recaps what you've all seen I can't see the chat or anything 
  actually I can make it so that I can see that though.
Mike Prorock:  I'll keep it monitored and yell if there's 
  something crazy and then.
Orie Steele:  Hopefully hopefully yeah there's interrupt does we 
  go love love for it to be more conversational given several talks 
  on did web at this point so it's fairly boring topic to me and 
  I'd rather take your questions and yeah it just just Dive Right 
  In so the purpose of today's talk is to just focus on what do you 
  if you're trying to.
Orie Steele:   Explore using did well.
Orie Steele:  What's a easy way to get started you know and how 
  can you use d-did web when you're sort of first learning about 
  decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials it's it's 
  not geared towards production and it's not even geared towards 
  sort of safe testing environment it's geared more towards a local 
  testing environment for developers giving them the tools they 
  need to figure out what's going on.
Orie Steele:  So high-level agenda we're going to briefly recap 
  what did web is going to talk about key generation and did 
  document construction and hosting and then there's just a brief 
  commentary on signing and verifying once you have added documents 
  nice to do something with it and then there's technical details 
  section which I imagine we spend a good amount of time and 
  because there's lots of fun privacy and security.
Orie Steele:   Purity considerations when it comes to did web.
Orie Steele:  And questions at the end but of course questions 
  along the way are welcome.
Orie Steele:  And I'll provide an export of these slides for 
  folks so you know don't worry I'll get up to the chairs at the 
  end so what did well well web is a way to use the centralized 
  identifiers with web infrastructure DNS and https and certificate 
  authorities another way of thinking about what did web is is its 
  kind of an alternate representation of oid see issuer and all IDC 
  you have a web origin and.
Orie Steele:   Well known open ID configuration and that.
Orie Steele:  Describes where to find signing keys for that web 
  origin as an issuer and those documents are Json documents the 
  configuration is a Json document that's not signed and it's 
  served from a web server with with TLS and the well-known J W KS 
  which contains public Keys is also not signed and is just a Json 
  file that serve from a web server.
Orie Steele:   And so one way of sort of just.
Orie Steele:  That is you know these are ways to discover keys 
  that are authoritative for a web origin and oh IDC has one way 
  that they do that for open ID connect and did web is just a way 
  to do that but for dids basically and then of course did web is 
  not a blockchain so if you were excited to talk about blockchain 
  here this is about web Technologies which have been around for 
  quite some time.
Orie Steele:   And so.
Orie Steele:  There's no blockchain here.
Orie Steele:  At the bottom are a series of pictures that I found 
  inspiring when thinking about what the web is.
Orie Steele:  Key generation the old-fashioned way.
Orie Steele:  If you if you want to if you want your did to be in 
  any way useful you're going to need to generate some keys and 
  you're going to want to keep the private key private and you're 
  going to want to put the public key in your did document and most 
  of what did create operation is in any did method is about that 
  first date document construction and getting your first Keys into 
  the document so here I've shown some excellent openssl commands 
  for generating nist.
Orie Steele:   Compliant public and private keys.
Orie Steele:  Just a quick note you know with openssl you're 
  going to get key formats like Pam and you're going to have to 
  convert them into like a jwk format if you want to host them in 
  your document and luckily there's like lots of really excellent 
  tools that will do that for you because this is a problem that 
  folks who have been using openssl have had for quite some time so 
  converting between pain and jwk is relatively easy converting 
  between pain and jwk and other more newer key.
Orie Steele:   Formats can be kind of tricky and when you're 
  building your first did.
<mprorock> wrong!
Orie Steele:  I would encourage you to think about maybe not 
  trying to support all of the different cool key formats you've 
  ever seen But focus on the ones that are going to help you 
  quickly verify your hypothesis like why are you using did web 
  what are you interested in doing you know try and use 
  off-the-shelf key formats as much as possible and you know just 
  because it's old does not mean it's socks or the newer stuff is 
  better Star Trek next Generation is the best Star Trek still.
Orie Steele:   So making.
<bumblefudge> here... here?
<mprorock> TOS all the way
Bob Wyman: Question: Please discuss relationship between did:web 
  and WebFinger. What does did:web do that WebFinger can't? Are 
  there use cases that would be well served by using both did:web 
  and WebFinger in the same app?
Orie Steele:  Document and this is a this is where I introduce 
  the spice they're part of this talk is going to be about a 
  product called n grok which I've used for many years and it's a 
  really great way of debugging network activity and opening 
  tunnels to localhost and exploring and securing you know web 
  services at the development phase so on the right hand side you 
  can see an example of a did document and.
Orie Steele:   And I created this Json.
Orie Steele:  Basically starting the and grok web service and 
  using its instrument apis to get the origin that it was but the 
  tunnel is bound to and that's what goes into the did web 
  identifier the public key also goes into the document and that 
  public key comes from the openssl key generation there wasn't any 
  cryptocurrency required there's no web 3 5 7 or 11.
Orie Steele:   Key formats although.
Orie Steele:  And if you were excited about experimenting with 
  those actually think did web can be a great place to do that 
  because you just add them as verification methods and it's Jason 
  and it's very easy to use and in this case there isn't any need 
  to add any other contexts or extensions if you're just trying to 
  do Jason this vocabulary that's added at the top basically will 
  automatically assign term definition so even the skull emoji and 
  the fire Emoji have term.
Orie Steele:   Missions here and so I highly recommend doing 
  this.
Orie Steele:  Because you will encounter all kinds of problems in 
  your libraries that are processing your did document if it's not 
  well formed json-ld so I always add a vocab to my did web 
  documents so that those libraries don't explode and then I can 
  look at you know a specific term assignments and I can decide 
  whether I like those term assignments or not and I'll show you at 
  the end a demo of a library that will definitely explode if it's 
  not valid Json till date.
Orie Steele:  Library that I use a lot in terms of so thinking 
  about what the shape of a json-ld to document looks like.
Orie Steele:  So hosting a did document it's not enough to just 
  have a Json file has to go on to a web server and this is where n 
  Gras comes in so the first line in the upper left-hand corner is 
  basically saying I'm going to serve a folder with korres on 
  localhost 3000 and normally that would only be accessible to you 
  of your on localhost 3000 on the server that's running but what 
  an grok will let you do.
Orie Steele:   Do is it'll let you bind a tunnel to that service.
Orie Steele:  See you know the in the end Rock Network diagram 
  what it looks like when you don't have that web service up so 
  it's green Up Until the End Rock agent and then it's red because 
  your web service isn't running but then if you turn your web 
  service on which is the first command in the upper left-hand 
  corner you get did Resolute you get an actual did resolution for 
  well it's not that resolution but it's the data web and point for 
  that web origin resolved successfully.
Orie Steele:   And that's because the.
Orie Steele:  As has spun up in the tunnel is binding to 
  localhost 3000 and its binding on this origin which is this you 
  know hexadecimal string Dot and rock that app and we can talk 
  more about that in the private in the sort of technical detail 
  section because there's all kinds of privacy issues with doing 
  this in a production environment but for testing there's a lot of 
  benefits for this with did web and again you know this is just an 
  example you probably know.
Orie Steele:   How to host Json files without using and rock I'm 
  just showing and rock here for the.
Orie Steele:  Showing developers that this is a tool that's 
  really useful when you're testing things with did well.
Orie Steele:  So on to sign and verify so if you're going to sign 
  and verify you need to be able to get key material I've shown on 
  the left hand side a little bash script that will use J Q2 which 
  is a tool for processing Json responses so this bash script will 
  work against any resolver that returns you know did documents in 
  a reasonable form.
Orie Steele:   And basically.
Orie Steele:  You're going to want to do is you need to get the 
  public key that you're going to use to verify the thing so 
  whatever it is that's been sign you got to get the public key 
  which means you have to talk to a resolver and in the context of 
  did web you know you could Implement that resolved or locally or 
  you could trust a third party resolver but one way or the other 
  you're going to have to dereference to the public key material to 
  check a signature.
Orie Steele:  See the key conversion piece at the bottom there 
  you know if you resolve a key but it's not in the right format 
  for your library that's going to check the signature you might 
  need to deep Dukey conversion before you can really process that 
  payload in a specific way.
Orie Steele:  Talking about creating the signature here if we 
  still have the private key from the original key generation we 
  can sign with that private key so we could sign choose to sign a 
  file then we're going to want to do this middle dereferencing 
  piece which is what we're just looking at before and that's you 
  know how do I get my public key that I need to do dereference I 
  need to get this public key in order to verify signatures that 
  are supposedly signed by it.
Orie Steele:   So dereferencing.
<mprorock> w?
Orie Steele:  Is really important for using did web for anything 
  like you need to get the keys verifying the signature or the 
  openssl is at the bottom and that's easy and that's only possible 
  because you've obtained that public key so you can basically use 
  existing libraries like openssl as long as you have a clear and 
  consistent way of moving from a did or a did URL to a public key 
  and so the main point that I'm trying to make here is that.
Orie Steele:   Is that like dad's might be a new way to discover 
  public keys.
Orie Steele:  The software that works with public and private 
  keys still works it's great some of that software is empowering 
  and securing major components of the internet for a very long 
  time and so one way of thinking about your first you know 
  experiments with dids might be how do I use all of the tools that 
  I'm really familiar with and then just add bids as a tiny little 
  extra step and that's really about key generation and 
  dereferencing in my opinion so if you're interested in exploring.
Orie Steele:   Flooring Dead's I'd suggest start with what you 
  know and try and add a.
Orie Steele:  As opposed to sort of starting with dids and then 
  trying to figure out why you're spending any time with kids.
Orie Steele:  So technical details there are a bunch of privacy 
  issues with with did web and I've included this excellent 
  Anonymous picture here with Anonymous bearing the coffin of 
  privacy a lot of folks have have pointed out that you know 40 IDC 
  servers it might be acceptable to disclose public keys that are 
  used to sign access tokens but that's because the server is 
  represent a business.
Orie Steele:  You wouldn't really.
Orie Steele:  I do that same kind of thing if it was for 
  individual like and human users or in particular human users that 
  are highly vulnerable to disruption through a normal legal 
  process or through State actions web infrastructure does have 
  some kinds of security issues associated with censorship and.
Orie Steele:  Attacks on certain layers of the network 
  infrastructure that powers the web are very easy for certain 
  classes of attacker and they're pretty hard for other classes of 
  attacker so depending on what your threat environment is did web 
  might be really not the right method for you I tend to think of 
  did web as being the right method for a lot of businesses 
  probably a lot of individual developers but definitely not the 
  best method for someone who's you know.
Orie Steele:   Really private.
Orie Steele:  A journalist or is a freedom fighter or terrorist 
  like I don't think did web is a good it's good for those use 
  cases at all I think they folks who are interested in you know 
  truly immutable self Sovereign identity would be better off with 
  other formats potentially ones that have no network observability 
  at all.
Orie Steele:   So I purely deterministic.
Orie Steele:  Did not consent so one thing to think about you 
  know with respect to did web is like well how can I trust the web 
  server to not add new keys or change you know the public key that 
  I've added and if you can't trust that web host service to not 
  tamper with your regular content you should definitely not trust 
  them to host your key material I'm so I used look GitHub to host 
  a lot of did did web demos and I.
Orie Steele:   I generally trust GitHub to not.
Orie Steele:  Ten that I put in a web server I also trust GitHub 
  to manage my version control for my software so I have a lot of 
  trust built into that web origin already and if I feel 
  comfortable with GitHub performing those operations then it 
  follows maybe I feel comfortable with GitHub not altering my my 
  did Json file which has the keys that I've added to it but you 
  know other folks might feel differently about GitHub right so 
  just be careful that you know with did.
Orie Steele:   You have to trust.
Orie Steele:  Service provider that's like an important part of 
  using did web.
Orie Steele:  And you know in terms of the privacy issues 
  associated with did what I'm about to show an example of exactly 
  what I mean with respect to privacy but that did Jason well-known 
  endpoint has to be resolved in order for did resolution on that 
  did web to succeed so that origin is seeing resolutions and they 
  might just be seeing resolutions for their single identifier but 
  in a world where they're using the path based routing so not the 
  well-known and point but but.
Orie Steele:   But many.
Orie Steele:  Origin and there's even more risk of privacy issues 
  and having the did controller you know in the context of the 
  hosting service provider have visibility into that it can be 
  actually really big benefit for certain businesses but it also 
  has privacy issues if those businesses are acting on behalf of 
  individuals.
Orie Steele:  Again there's no blockchain here so web 
  infrastructure has been shown to scale pretty well.
Orie Steele:  And then if you want to learn like a lot more of 
  like the technical details behind what's really going on with did 
  web I've included some scripts on the right hand side for 
  analyzing a did web you know this is not black magic it's the Dig 
  curl and traceroute commands but they can help start to sort of 
  pique your curiosity regarding the security infrastructure that 
  goes behind did web and whether or not you can trust content that 
  you're looking at if you're doing.
Orie Steele:   Did resolution.
Orie Steele:  And the rest is appendix and so I can give a demo 
  now unless there's further questions.
Patrick_(IDLab): I have a few questions I'm wondering if I should 
  wait for the demo first or just go ahead.
Orie Steele:  And ask now.
Patrick_(IDLab): All right so my first question so regarding the 
  whole block chain thing in the did method so it's fair to assume 
  that depending on the did method there is sort of infrastructure 
  backing it and the case of did web it's obviously a lot more open 
  handed but if you have like the did you PSI for example we know 
  very well that there is a blockchain infrastructure behind it and 
  this going to bring some sort of implicit.
Patrick_(IDLab):  Concepts to the documents that are.
Patrick_(IDLab): Start there the most notably wand obviously 
  availability is going to be a big one in youth ability and some 
  kind of access control for writing on that server so parallel to 
  that there's the concept of the verifiable data registry so how 
  do you how would you explain the correlation between the 
  verifiable data registry and the underlying infrastructure does a 
  what I mean is does a verifiable data registry need.
Patrick_(IDLab):  to have certain security features and it.
Patrick_(IDLab): Secret few key features are really just 
  depending on the infrastructures on which it relies that that 
  make sense.
Orie Steele:  Okay so the four when you create a did method you 
  describe the identifier format so that's like you know what the 
  identifier is going to look like and then you describe the 
  operations create update resolved and deactivate and then you 
  define security and privacy considerations.
Orie Steele:   In any did.
Orie Steele:  Lies on a verifiable data registry as a software 
  component you usually have some treatment of the privacy and 
  security considerations section for that component so if you use 
  the theorem or Bitcoin your privacy and security considerations 
  should say something like we used ethereum or Bitcoin for this 
  it's a public permission list you know Ledger and anyone can 
  write to it but everyone can read from it and there are other.
Orie Steele:   No security issues.
Orie Steele:  Blah you talk about the verifiable data registry in 
  your privacy and security considerations section.
Orie Steele:  If you so if you're talking about the kind of the 
  verifiable data registry as it was sort of more of an abstract 
  concept.
Patrick_(IDLab): But my concern is like how does the verifiable 
  that urgency fit into did when I guess it's the my main question.
Orie Steele:  Yeah so yeah so the the what is the registry right 
  the registry here is its DNS and it's a combination of DNS and 
  HTTP and certificates it's not just you know one software 
  component it's a slice across the web stack and adding each of 
  those components up produces the consistent software experience 
  that implementers rely on to build did web resolution or 
  resolved.
Orie Steele:   All that.
<bumblefudge> in terms of historical resolution/versionTime=, the 
  registry is the Internet Archive 🌶️
Orie Steele:  Resolve operation for did web you need to consume 
  those layers of the web infrastructure how those layers are 
  implemented could vary greatly right so you could have a scenario 
  where you know one did web uses a specific web server and a 
  specific web origin and another one uses a totally different you 
  know top-level domain totally different web hosting 
  infrastructure and those are different implementation details 
  underneath the same verifiable data registry.
Orie Steele:  Does that make sense.
Patrick_(IDLab): Yeah it does so the reliability of this VD R is 
  going to really depend on the underlying implementation so you 
  could have two implementation of did web one can be secured and 
  the other one less secured yeah.
Orie Steele:  Yeah yeah and you haven't really said this directly 
  but I hear maybe hear a hint of it and what you've mentioned 
  before like what if you really like a blockchain and you want to 
  use the blockchain to manage the did Json documents and then you 
  just expose the did Json documents on a web origin then the web 
  origin is still trusted to not tamper with the those documents 
  but you're kind of using a really stronger database.
Orie Steele:   The store them instead of just putting files on a 
  web server and.
Orie Steele:  You allowed to.
Orie Steele:  Do that but remember the trust is in the web origin 
  because the web origin is the root and that's where tampering can 
  occur.
Patrick_(IDLab): Yeah so that there was something else I'm 
  exploring is obviously with did web you could within some 
  document you could reference other did methods so like object 
  stored on other did methods so another question I would have is 
  if me as my implementation I want to make an API that's meant to 
  respond to did web request is that from the pain or.
Patrick_(IDLab):  is that fine.
Patrick_(IDLab): Storing a document but I'm sort of responding a 
  document dynamically.
Orie Steele:  No that's totally fine like so the file like the 
  did Jason is like that the spec says this endpoint is what you 
  must perform an HTTP resolution on to get the did document it 
  does not tell you whether you have to implement the endpoint as a 
  file or as a database query that talks to a blockchain or 
  whatever you can do that however you like.
Mike Prorock:  Exactly there's a good degree of flexibility there 
  and I'm just jumping in because I see Bob on the cue and I do 
  want to make sure or he's able to get to demo as well but Bob 
  fire up.
<bumblefudge> controller property
Juan Caballero: "Controller":"did:stronger-vdr:alice"
Bob Wyman:  Okay question okay give them the did web it relies on 
  DNS it uses HTTP to fetch documents it doesn't rely or doesn't 
  require any crypto and it exploits the dot well-known.
Mike Prorock:  You got it.
Bob Wyman:  A convention so the obvious question is is did web 
  really just a profile on the use of webfinger and can we say 
  right so so why why do we have why do we have did web as anything 
  other than a profile on webfinger like when would I can did web 
  do something that webfinger can't is there ever a case.
Bob Wyman:   I swear I would want both.
Bob Wyman:  And did wave in the same app like.
Mike Prorock: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033
Orie Steele:  Great great question so I'm webfinger is obviously 
  useful as a building block in lots of other ecosystems like you 
  know I think activity Pub or or Mastodon or one of one of those 
  systems definitely uses it I've had to use it before.
Bob Wyman:  Macedonia is it although not very well and kind of in 
  a silly way but anyway.
Orie Steele:  But the point basically there is that like the web 
  server has a need to expose whether accounts exist on An Origin 
  or not and that's kind of very strongly aligned with the did web 
  path based identifiers approach format but it's not very well 
  aligned with the raw origin did Web format so there's there's two 
  primary ways to resolve a did web document one is the well-known 
  did Jason and the other is a path based routing.
Orie Steele:   And I mean if you asking not.
Orie Steele:  In like it would be much better to just throw out 
  everything that we have for did web and rebuild a profile on top 
  of web finger.
Orie Steele:  But that's not how standards work like this thing 
  has been around since basically the beginning of dids and it's 
  evolved to have its shape based on the community contribution and 
  feedback spec is under development at the ccg and it becomes very 
  hard to change what a did method is over time and that's why it's 
  great to be able to create new did methods that have the 
  properties that you wish the other did methods have and then you 
  know you can advocate for hey.
Orie Steele:   Guys like stop using did web start using did web 
  finger or.
Bob Wyman:  Well what is it about.
Bob Wyman:  Did web that would need to change if one said it is a 
  profile of wet finger.
Orie Steele:  You have to describe the read operation in the 
  verifiable data registry in terms of the web finger standard.
Orie Steele:  That's just sentences in a document basically.
Bob Wyman:  Okay but other than changing sentences with anything 
  semantically change.
Bob Wyman:  Like what any bits on The Wire have to change if one 
  said that it was a webfinger profile.
Orie Steele:  I mean the content that you're getting from the in 
  the response would be different but you know.
Orie Steele:  The overall approach that you're suggesting is one 
  that can be explored and you know I encourage folks to just go 
  make a new did method as a profile of webfinger and look at did 
  web and look at the thing that you've got and you know show what 
  the differences might be I think that sounds like a fun fun thing 
  to do.
Bob Wyman:  Okay it just strikes me that.
Bob Wyman:  Frances between did web and potentially it did 
  webfinger are so subtle that.
Bob Wyman:  Not doing ourselves a favor by having this variety of 
  this kind of variety or these differences like.
Bob Wyman:  I mean this is is this ietf versus w3c is that what's 
  going on here.
Orie Steele:  I don't really know what you're what you're getting 
  at with that but the in at least in the context of like the 
  approach that did spec Registries and did core you know first 
  publication took the approach was to document requirements where 
  we could get consensus as a working group and then to make it 
  possible for people to really.
Orie Steele:   Explore the.
Orie Steele:  Space of did methods and we did that with the did 
  method Registries so you it's very easy you can easily create a 
  new did method and it could be 99.9% the same as an existing one 
  and if you've made some small Improvement to it that justifies 
  giving it a separate name great and no one can stop you from 
  doing that right it would be a problem if You Were Somehow not 
  able to do that because it would be evidence that the 
  decentralization property of the specification was weekly 
  implemented.
Bob Wyman:  I understand I understand that did webfinger would be 
  trivial to spec and get registered but we didn't wasn't there 
  just on the list there was recently a discussion about how 
  flexibility ain't quite all its said to be.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah there's there's I mean there's a bunch of 
  stuff in it honestly like Baba actually I like this kind of 
  conversation because I think it's going down some interesting 
  especially meta type like you know how can we improve things are 
  we putting effort in the right places etcetera but but I'd say 
  let's probably table it for now and take the conversation to the 
  list just because I Seek You stacking up and I want to make sure 
  or he has 10 minutes at least four.
Mike Prorock:   Demo followed by a question or two.
Bob Wyman:  Okay sorry if I go too far off track.
Orie Steele:  It's great is it ready.
Mike Prorock:  If that works for you oh yeah yeah no worries yeah 
  it's a cool topic and that's why it's easy to go away who you 
  know way deep in lots of different directions on this so many.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah just real quick to try and address Bob's 
  concern the fundamental differences are the webfinger the the 
  file that you get at the other side is a totally different data 
  format from the from the did spec there's no compatibility with 
  the rest of the did methods so you know it would be kind of a 
  one-off you know for webfinger it was considered but you know 
  webfinger was.
Manu Sporny:   Kind of you know.
Manu Sporny:  Specifier in webfinger it was just designed for 
  kind of a different problem space you can step back and go like 
  oh yeah I can see how there are more or less the same thing and 
  that's true but the problems come in when you go to implement 
  right lawyer where you go to implement key formats and file 
  layout and yeah exactly that's where everything kind of falls 
  apart that's it.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah compliance with the data model itself and 
  stuff like that yeah yeah yeah cool yeah awesome thanks man who 
  and or you want to dive into demo and then we can take a few 
  questions here.
Orie Steele:  Sure so I have running in this tab that web server 
  command.
<smagennis> zoom in please
Orie Steele:  This MPX serve of the WW origin and that's what is 
  meaning this localhost pieces up here and then over here I have 
  the an grok binding and you can see these you know server logs 
  are reporting to me every time a resolution occurs so if I go to 
  a resolver like this resolver processes did documents that are 
  well formed json-ld and it makes you this like.
Orie Steele:   Little graph.
Orie Steele:  So you can you know look at the different 
  components and pull them around zoom in and out of them in 3D 
  space or whatever I was I made this resolver to basically 
  highlight the cool part of json-ld and the did course back you 
  can see you know all of these different relationships here for 
  this one particular key and then you know you can see other 
  details about that particular key you can see blank note 
  identifiers Everyone likes to look at those.
Mike Prorock: https://lucid.did.cards/
<manu_sporny> Very cool demo! :)
Orie Steele:  Like you know this particular format this only 
  works because this is a well-formed json-ld document and every 
  time you know I refresh this you can see another resolution so 
  I'm tracking my own resolutions on my did basically here and if I 
  look to another resolver so different web origin and I resolved 
  again it's going to trigger another one of these here.
Orie Steele:   Inside of an grok.
Orie Steele:  Deeper at these so this is like their minimal 
  interface that they provide but they have full request response 
  introspection available here which can be really helpful if 
  you're debugging something detailed but the important thing to 
  note here is that this is just the well-known did Jason so I 
  don't know what the user is trying to do with the did document 
  like I don't know if they're trying to look at a specific 
  verification method there's only one verification method good 
  chance that that's what they're looking.
Orie Steele:   For here.
Orie Steele:  I have hundreds in here and then I wouldn't 
  necessarily know which key they were trying to use and for what 
  purpose and similarly for service you know endpoints like there 
  aren't any service and points in this particular did document but 
  if there were I would just see resolutions of the did Jason I 
  wouldn't know exactly what they're trying to do here but just 
  having that timing information can be a big problem like if you 
  imagine this wasn't me self-hosting but instead this is me.
Orie Steele:   Me and to some degree and rock is still seeing 
  some of this transaction.
Orie Steele:  So if I you know if this weren't you know for 
  development and testing purposes maybe I'm concerned I'm leaking 
  did resolutions to and rock because they can see each did 
  resolution that's happening as a result of this well-known did 
  Jason but again this is for one origin and this is me 
  self-hosting that's very different than if you look at the server 
  logs for this resolved or here where this resolver is going to 
  have resolution logs for every did method that's resolved through 
  it.
Orie Steele:   So the point here is you know if you.
Orie Steele:  If you want to use did web and grok and a Json file 
  and a simple web server is really really easy way to get started 
  and if you want you know to take the entire thing down you just 
  killed it and Iraq instance and when you go to resolve it not 
  going to resolve on any resolvers anymore and the wet local 
  webservers up but the tunnel is down and like that's that's the 
  whole sort of Point like you you were basically adding in these.
Orie Steele:   These layers to serve Json files and that lets you 
  easily update the.
Orie Steele:  Machine you don't have to.
Orie Steele:  Push anywhere you just change the file and it's 
  going to change the behavior on the web server.
Orie Steele:   That's it.
Mike Prorock:  Cool thank you sir Patrick I see you on the queue.
Patrick_(IDLab): Yes I usually have a few questions try to be 
  sensible of time sometime I get over myself this is it was very 
  interesting I've been looking at did web for the last two weeks 
  or so like I mentioned beginning I'm trying to do like some 
  prototype proof of concept implementation for the an incred 
  specification so without going into too many details there's a 
  requirement.
Patrick_(IDLab):  to sort of.
Patrick_(IDLab): Serve other type of documents than a did Json 
  documents mostly just Json structure that are necessary to 
  process the type of credentials that are issued and verified and 
  upon my research I came to the conclusion that the best way to do 
  that would be to use services in the documents and so more 
  specifically I think.
Patrick_(IDLab):  think like a sort of a file storage.
Patrick_(IDLab): Service that would resolve these document so my 
  first question is how I can.
Orie Steele:  Yeah so you can't you can't just take did web and 
  get the behavior you want there because what you're really asking 
  is I need a resolver that knows how to handle related resources 
  in the URLs right.
<bumblefudge> nginx rules?
Orie Steele:  Yeah so you need a resolver to do that and resolver 
  might be able to process the path component of the did URL or 
  process query parameters in a did URL and that resolution process 
  would usually the way that it works it would resolve the did 
  document then it would use the did document to resolve the 
  relative resource or external resource and it would do that by 
  processing the other components of the.
Orie Steele:   Did your El.
Patrick_(IDLab): Exactly so let's say I have a service which is 
  my resolver which is I think what you're referring to.
Patrick_(IDLab): If I if in my did document I use one of the 
  service let's say I want to one of the examples like a shimmering 
  so I need to publish some scare Maya is like a defined data model 
  so I have one of my services could be like Shimmer resolver let's 
  just pretend.
Orie Steele:  Yep wait but you need that web service that knows 
  how to handle did your Ells that point to resources that aren't 
  in documents at web service is a resolver and resolvers are not 
  standardized so you know you have the whole you can read the did 
  resolution spec it's a draft in the ccg you know it's going to 
  handle that one way other people can Implement other ways to 
  handle did urls.
Orie Steele:   Yes and this is its.
Orie Steele:  With did core like this is an area of the working 
  group wanted to do more but you know our Charter forbid us from 
  making this easy.
Juan Caballero: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-web/issues/61#issuecomment-1201181499
<bumblefudge> ^ This might help
Patrick_(IDLab): Okay because at the moment my way of thinking 
  was to use like it did web URL with query you know parameters 
  with the service and the relative reference I think it's called 
  it's not pretty you know and I'm wondering what's the point of 
  this service query the service parameter if it points in the did 
  document to.
Patrick_(IDLab):  like that.
<bumblefudge> but orie's right on the resolution side
Patrick_(IDLab): Fragment could I just use the fragment directly 
  instead of a service parameter.
Orie Steele:  So usually the fragments are for referring to sub 
  resources in the document that you resolved with a specific media 
  type so they're not really great for identifying external 
  resources that's not their primary use there to there to identify 
  sub resources in a result document the purpose of the service 
  parameter and the relative ref you know features and these are 
  extensions too.
Orie Steele:   Decor that are in the did Speck Registries was to 
  give.
Orie Steele:  There's a way to create did URLs for resources that 
  they are in control of without binding to a specific location so 
  I could have an ipfs Gateway that I use to host ipfs content and 
  I can make did relative ref did URLs for ipfs hashes and then if 
  that Gateway service provider goes away I just change their 
  service and point out and all the did URLs are still the same but 
  the ipfs Gateway that's.
Orie Steele:   Used to resolve is no different.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah Brent I see you on the call so I'm going to 
  put you on the spot because I know at least At Last he pack some 
  discussion came up around standardizing some of the resolution 
  side and things like that to get at these issues and what's your 
  sense of where things would be going possibly in the future from 
  a did working group reformation and you know potential work.
BrentZ: So did working group right now is you know on extension 
  while we work on a draft of the new Charter the primary work in 
  the new Charter is to maintain the did course back there was 
  conversation around some possibly additional things did methods 
  and did resolution primary amongst them even if the did working 
  group Charter in ends up including.
BrentZ:  those things.
BrentZ: It wouldn't result in a normative specification within 
  the next couple of years most likely it would be for the group 
  after the next group to more formally address those as part of 
  the did work.
Orie Steele:  But just to be clear on the point I think the 
  current did working group can work on documents of a pre 
  candidate recommendation draft status that would be related to 
  standardizing specific did methods or standardizing specific did 
  resolution processes that correct.
BrentZ: It is proposed that the next did working group would have 
  that in its Charter yes.
Orie Steele:  Right yeah the charter is Charter text has recently 
  received a pull request that emerged that and the charter text is 
  not yet been voted on I think right.
BrentZ: Write the next step is presenting it to the AC and having 
  a conversation with the rest of w3c around how they feel about 
  our proposed new chart.
Mike Prorock:  I am sure that will go flawlessly and perfectly 
  smooth.
Orie Steele:  And I guess you'd have to be on the AC members list 
  to participate in that conversation because it'll it won't be 
  open.
BrentZ: It is formally a conversation amongst AC representatives 
  for w3c member organizations.
Mike Prorock:  Cool well with that I see we're coming up towards 
  the top of the hour there's been a goal for us to not run this 
  meeting much Beyond 5 minutes to the top of the hour since 
  everything seems to be running back to back these days I am going 
  to just check the queue and see if there's any kind of final 
  questions comments and otherwise I'm going to let already closed 
  down and thank him for his time because this was extremely 
  helpful and a nice thorough Deep dive.
Orie Steele:  Awesome thanks always fun to present on something 
  technical I'll give a PDF of the slides to the chairs for the for 
  the list notes and if you have any questions their repository 
  with all the code for the demo is public and it's linked in the 
  slides and feel free to file issues their message me in the dip 
  Slack.
<harrison_tang> thank you, Orie !
<manu_sporny> Great presentation, thanks Orie!
Mike Prorock:  Awesome thank you so much mr. orry with that 
  everyone please have a wonderful day and we will close.
