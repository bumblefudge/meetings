<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> tangent — I 
  notice that `Meeting for 2023-10-16-vc-education` is the latest 
  EDU call in https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/ ... and there's 
  no link from there to the "raw" files/directories
<dmitri_zagidulin> oh huh
<dmitri_zagidulin> hi Rachel! we ended the meeting early; we're 
  just hanging out and chatting at the moment
<rachel_donahue_(she/they)_-_digital_promise> How does CTDL 
  compare to schema.org?  Most people in the VC community seem to 
  be moving toward CTDL but I'm relatively new and still learning 
  about RDF
<rachel_donahue_(she/they)_-_digital_promise> Hi thanks Dmitri!  
  The meetings haven't been showing up on my calendar so I just 
  took a chance today :)
<dmitri_zagidulin> ohh hmm I should take a look at the calendar 
  thing
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> "Credential 
  Transparency Description Language"
<rachel_donahue_(she/they)_-_digital_promise> It stands for 
  credential description transparency language
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> 
  lod-cloud.net
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> JSON-LD or 
  Turtle or N3 or N-Triples or N-Quads or TriG or ....
<rachel_donahue_(she/they)_-_digital_promise> Thanks y'all,
