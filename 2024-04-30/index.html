<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Joe Andrieu</span>:  Actually came out of the ccg and it had stabilized as a task force. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)&gt; A Task Force is a subset of the CCG, typically being those who self-select to work on one or more Work Items. It can be thought of like a subcommittee.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Joe Andrieu</span>:  The main reason is because you want to meet every week like to have a regular rhythm um and I don&apos;t know how long the VC task force works but that was how I first got involved um and the the entire point was really to incubate to the point of having a charter that could be adopted and so the community notes that were developed alongside that like the VC use cases were intended to eventually go to the working group so that was how we have leveraged that in the past to good effect um assuming you like verifiable credentials. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="information">Harrison_Tang: Thanks Joe Kenn you&apos;re next. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Um so I started the vceda you know we we could have started work items in you know gone met sort of met within the ccg meetings run it as a you know sort of like you asked for a status on work items at the beginning kind of thing um but we had enough of our own sort of momentum conversations we had to have and um a set of work items and it is also that we didn&apos;t know we were still sort of Designing what that would look like so I&apos;ll put in the charter I think the main thing um it it to do this it&apos;s good to make sure upfront you have a reasonable set of people that that are really committed to participating in it um. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Manu called this Charter the best charter he&apos;d ever seen written so I probably should have retired after after writing that but um so like being very clear about what your intended deliverables are which uh how you relate to other organizations so that you&apos;re not um you know sort of. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Overlapping too much so um so yeah that group has been really successful um in terms of you know sort of just figuring out which use cases they want to address um coming up with data formats that are appropriate for it they&apos;ve um you know even promoted some of the work into IMS or now called 1 Ed Tech um uh standards so um yeah that was the context on VCU. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="information">Harrison_Tang: Uh by the way will um I think your your sound is a little bit on the lighter side we cannot really see you. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Yeah we had for a while a practice in the ccg of saying um the task forces must report out status with some certain Cadence so um I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s done much anymore but it was a good practice on both sides um yeah. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="information">Harrison_Tang: Actually Ted Ted you&apos;re in the queue. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="information">TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Yeah just quickly um task force is roughly like a subcommittee um we&apos;ll get together outside of the main sessions to. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="information">TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Work on a work item 1 or more work items um whether or not the task force reports out its results to the main group sort of depends on the work item whether that makes sense uh. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="information">TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It may be set out as a work item because nobody else is interested and only that sub Cruise group cares and so they don&apos;t need to report out necessarily unless there is a real Milestone hit if it&apos;s just ongoing discussions then there&apos;s nothing to report out and that&apos;s fine. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="information">TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Yeah hopefully that helps clarify things a little bit. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Dmitri Zagidulin</span>:  Just just had a random idea as as we&apos;re talking about this about how to improve connections between the task force and uh the main ccg. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Dmitri Zagidulin</span>:   And I was wondering. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Dmitri Zagidulin</span>:  Be worth uh working it in to part of our boilerplate ritual right when we say are their introductions in the introductions and Community announcements uh what if we had a section uh any of the task forces or work item leaders want to report something right so just just leave it at that right as a reminder as a weekly reminder to connect. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Dmitri Zagidulin</span>:  Yeah that&apos;s a good that&apos;s a good idea. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Yeah I mean I we I remember these conversations at Joe&apos;s on the call as well um we really leaned into um uh embracing this uh Power of Silence awkward silence um you know and calling on on people to make them accountable to uh to to the work items so I think for a while it was part of the role that we would say like um you know we would tell task forces you will uh report out on this date and then so we would call on them but then also we would cycle through work items and um even if people so it was just part of our ritual and um often the answer would be nothing&apos;s been done nothing&apos;s been done but it was still kind of a good forcing function because eventually progress would be made and I do think that we were trying to do something for a while about you know after there&apos;s not progressed after. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:   After a certain time. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Uh the chairs put a comment in the issue and say this doesn&apos;t progress by X time we will assume it&apos;s on hold um because I think for a while we were just dealing with so many work items that we had to start being a little more forceful about to make sure our attention could focus. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="information">Harrison_Tang: Joe do you have a comment. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
