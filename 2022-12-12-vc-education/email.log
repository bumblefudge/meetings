Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
<jeff_o_-_humanos> Is transcriber on?\

Topic: Connecting the European Higher Education accreditation framework to the VC ecosystem with Colin Tuck\

Colin_(EQAR): Yes hi everyone thanks thanks Simone for the kind 
  introduction and hi everyone please to to join your meeting today 
  I'm so I'm calling I've been working as the Director of Academia 
  open quality assurance register basically since its founding 
  which is in 2008 and so I've prepared a few slides indeed I'm 
  going to show them why Prezi I hope you.\
Colin_(EQAR):  you see them more mirrored but the right way.\
Colin_(EQAR): Normal is see them in the you see them in the 
  video.\
Colin_(EQAR): That's too bad well.\
Colin_(EQAR): Well let me yeah let me then quickly put the link 
  right yeah so that's going to take a second I can probably send 
  you a link over the stand.\
Colin_(EQAR): I've never used that life crazy before but it's 
  supposed to be possible so let's see.\
https://prezi.com/live/eqar/\
Colin_(EQAR): I will put the link into the shop.\
Colin_(EQAR): Well that's great.\
<jeff_o_-_humanos> link good here so far\
Colin_(EQAR): Well I give it a few seconds and I'll also send 
  that's the that's the LifeLink LED this chair for reference I 
  just share a link towards work afterwards again without the life 
  one.\
<colin_(eqar)> (For reference: 
  https://prezi.com/view/fgwiU4FnmQ8izHNMQu4G/)\
Colin_(EQAR): Should be like one should be good for now let me 
  just change my video here done with that wouldn't you stopped or 
  but just presented from here life okay so I'm going to try to sum 
  up in a few words okay what is our starting what is the European 
  higher education quality assurance system because I.\
Colin_(EQAR): And of course there will be some people won't hear 
  from you but many will not be and some might be familiar with 
  that and some might not so sorry for those that are already 
  familiar with it if it's going to be any boring but I think it 
  it's just to illustrate what is the starting point for linking 
  this to the fiber credential echo system so in the European 
  higher education area we have a quality assurance.\
Colin_(EQAR):  this framework that consists of.\
<simone_ravaioli_(vc_edu)> Can everyone follow  the slides ?\
<sharon_leu> Works for me.\
Colin_(EQAR): Of standards they are called the ESG or the 
  European standards and guidelines for quality assurance and they 
  have already been agreed since 2005 as a general set of standards 
  for quality assurance at the institutional level at external 
  level in higher education for the whole European higher education 
  area and these statements are then used by national and Regional 
  quality assurance and accreditation by this too.\
Colin_(EQAR):  to to do.\
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> sure\
<simone_ravaioli_(vc_edu)> Thanks\
Colin_(EQAR): Collected editions of higher education institutions 
  and programs in Europe so the nail in addition to the ESG as a 
  set of Standards you have a card or the organization I represent 
  European quality assurance register and we are the official 
  register of quality assurance agencies that have proven their 
  compliance with the agreed set of Standards so we currently have 
  about 50 agencies on the register from a number of you.\
Colin_(EQAR):  in countries and these agencies were call.\
Colin_(EQAR): Common language reference framework so so we have 
  currently the those countries you see in green on the map if you 
  see the slide of course so that's 29 countries in Europe that do 
  work in line with the agreed standards and that are working with 
  agents quality assurance and equitation agencies that I register 
  Tanaka and this part of the common agreed framework then.\
Colin_(EQAR):  a couple of years.\
Colin_(EQAR): Have had an addition to the register of agencies we 
  have also been maintaining a pan-european database of quality 
  assured higher education institutions and programs so we so we 
  have been working to bring together all the information on 
  accredited higher education institutions and programs by those 50 
  agencies in one single place in one single European one.\
Colin_(EQAR):  One Stop Shop to make that easily available.\
Colin_(EQAR): For the public and because we thought okay we do 
  have a common framework so we need to have also the information 
  on who has been accredited in line with that agreed framework in 
  one place and in one comparable format especially if there was a 
  specially created for the purposes of furthering recognition and 
  automatic recognition within the European area but I think it's 
  something that comes in very hard for now on trying to link.\
Colin_(EQAR):  this existing.\
Colin_(EQAR): Through the by fiber credentialing system onto 
  digital credentials in more General because as a result of that 
  work on Decca we have a comprehensive data set on accredited 
  higher education institutions and programs in at least 20 23 
  European countries and that the number keeps growing because 
  they're covering more and more countries by their agencies being 
  registered with us and by the age.\
Colin_(EQAR):  this is providing us with data on.\
Colin_(EQAR): Higher education institutions and programs so since 
  we already have data for so many countries in a standardized 
  format it of course seems quite logical to go through us to to 
  connect those to the very fiber credentials echo system to make 
  sure that quality assurance data can be easily used in in the 
  field of digital credentials I'm going to say a few words about 
  linking.\
Colin_(EQAR): Canvas with the European digital credentials for 
  learning initiative which is an EU initiative and that is 
  currently not based on verifiable credentials but as far as we 
  understand that might that might change in the future and that is 
  just to to illustrate briefly that we have also other digital 
  credentials existence where Deca data is already linked to but so 
  is so the European digital credentials initiative is based on.\
Colin_(EQAR):  on bit closer.\
Colin_(EQAR): In this is if it's based on every country providing 
  a list of accredited education providers so in that case there's 
  basically a poor country export of data from decorated that 
  countries can use to to feed that information into the European 
  digital credentials ecosystem and once they do that it can be 
  used in a standardized way but I'm not going to go into details 
  with that but rather say a few words about linking duck under 
  verifiable credentials are.\
Colin_(EQAR):  assisting with is as Somalia said being inspired.\
Colin_(EQAR): Pepsi or initiative but I do want to underline that 
  is of course not limited to AB c-- for us because in a way AB C 
  AB c-- was the first concrete starting point where we were that 
  made us think about linking DACA to verifiable credentials and 
  expressing data from that caused by fiber credentials but we also 
  soon realize that that is not that that should not be limited to 
  AB c-- and that of course.\
Colin_(EQAR):  there might be a more generic use case for.\
https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/What+is+ebsi\
Colin_(EQAR): So in FCS some of you probably know the the general 
  idea is that quality assurance a quotation results itself is also 
  expressed as a very fiber credential in our case the issue of 
  that accreditation cadential would be would be a cow in a way 
  it's we are not as such the issue of the accreditation because we 
  are not accredited education institutions that.\
Colin_(EQAR):  we are quite a thing we are creditors if you 
  like.\
Colin_(EQAR): So in this case we will be acting as a proxy for 
  the accredited agencies to issue by fiber credentials and they 
  would of course be issued to the higher education institution 
  that is accredited with some details in a about the scope or 
  specific program study program or degree that is accredited of 
  course we have I think we have.\
Colin_(EQAR): With a quotation credentials you have one ones say 
  one advantage of one aspect that makes some things rather simple 
  for us because all the data all the information we are talking 
  about is public by Nature so privacy is not really an issue at 
  all for an accreditation could ensure so we are our approach to 
  files being to basically offer well.\
Colin_(EQAR):  a fiber credentials them.\
Colin_(EQAR): Nothing I could have taken for download which could 
  be for public download so the institution concerned or anyone 
  else who needs to rely on it could use it because there's a 
  really nothing private or Secret in there so as a result of as a 
  result of discussions with an absolute with yeah started on the 
  one hand to issue the issue AB c-- compliant ofc a standard 
  aligned the very fiber credentials.\
Colin_(EQAR):  to use within the apps ecosystem but we have.\
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> this looks like a very logical 
  set of data to publish as linked open data in CTDL-- that would 
  provide the data structure to connect the QA information to the 
  specific credentials issued\
Colin_(EQAR): Empowering than mainly as a proof of concept for 
  now we have also been issuing let's say a generic de Cobo fiber 
  credentials just to just to show how we could easily I should 
  verify the credentials for any accusation of quality assurance 
  and deca so I'm going to say a few words about the implementation 
  how we're doing that for now we're using a software called.\
Colin_(EQAR):  SI kit by V ID.\
https://walt.id/ssi-kit\
Colin_(EQAR): To to basically do the fiber credential signing and 
  so so we basically integrated that with our existing deck aback 
  and and whenever we need Deco report expressed as a very fiber 
  production which is the SSI cat2222 request and sign that it's a 
  credential I'm done with this as I said eventually presented 
  publicly.\
Colin_(EQAR):  luckily for download so this is how it would look 
  if.\
https://credreg.net/ctdl/terms/QACredentialOrganization#QACredentialOrganization\
Colin_(EQAR): Look as a single accreditation record on Decca in 
  this case it's an Institutional a quotation of a university in 
  Spain and here you would see that you could find the very fiber 
  credential that both in the genomic data format which would be 
  available for all institutions and all accreditations we have in 
  this case because it is an institution University that is 
  participating also the ab c-- early adopters you would also find 
  it there.\
Colin_(EQAR):  are in an under specifically for form.\
https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Early+Adopters\
Colin_(EQAR): Why us so I'm just going to zoom into how the 
  credential looks like that's now a generic decode them show where 
  you would see them the main problem I would say well the main 
  shortcoming we see now with the generic could mshulist that we 
  are not able to issue it to any to any date for the University at 
  the moment so at this moment for proof of.\
Colin_(EQAR):  except we just identified.\
Colin_(EQAR): Education institution by playing UI which refers to 
  its identifier on Decca and but of course that is not that would 
  not be that would not be very good for ya for production use and 
  the case we do have an institution that participates an AB c-- of 
  course there would be issued to the app see the ID of the 
  institution and well otherwise you would see the details of the 
  accreditation or.\
Colin_(EQAR):  or were in the credential we also include.\
Colin_(EQAR): On the identifiers of the institution that we know 
  of for example from the last month program from other European 
  Registries of higher education institutions Etc and and then of 
  course there this point for generic generic credentials we issue 
  them by the web from our side was the ab c-- credentials would be 
  issued by our data.\
Colin_(EQAR):  oopsy and of course.\
Colin_(EQAR): To include the information on the actual 
  accreditation Agency on whose behalf so we are showing that 
  credential understand the actual accreditation now to finish off 
  with open questions and issues we have or I could see of course 
  one main questions how eventually how will we link quality 
  assurance cadential and the qualification credential that is 
  issued under that act rotational I'm not that.\
Colin_(EQAR):  it's a.\
Colin_(EQAR): Quality officer quality assurance in the case of ab 
  c-- days of there is an approach of translation register sewing 
  the case of a Pepsi will work in such a way that the higher 
  education institution takes the very fiber credential that we 
  issued to them and upload that themselves onto the trusted issue 
  register with their with their own apps idiot of course they're 
  the biggest problem for doing anything at scale for.\
Colin_(EQAR):  US would be to how do we.\
https://api-pilot.ebsi.eu/docs/apis/trusted-issuers-registry/latest\
Colin_(EQAR): Our existing data set to higher education 
  institutions identity in the sense of any kind of did based 
  identity they might use for also later on issuing credentials to 
  students for app see that that works only manually for now so 
  what if we do have an institution that the participates in the 
  axial adopters we would need to go into our into our data set and 
  record their the ab c-- did some worm before before we could.\
Colin_(EQAR):  tissue an FC Alliance accreditation.\
Colin_(EQAR): As I said before for other higher education 
  institutions with do not have any any system in place yet for 
  linking the data we have to do any kind of did the institution 
  might be using we have been thinking that could be a possibility 
  for trying some kind of Auto Discovery or all to matching of the 
  web's because we one of the information that we do have on every 
  higher education Institution.\
Colin_(EQAR):  that is in that car is the.\
Colin_(EQAR): Domain and web site so so there will be one 
  possible Avenue for for doing that and of course we might think 
  of there any other ways to reliably and automatically true for 
  link the higher education institutions are density and that car 
  through the two that did of whatever thought so for example we 
  could imagine that if a higher education institution can could 
  produce a wave.\
Colin_(EQAR):  a fiber presentation that includes.\
Colin_(EQAR): Could answer by any kind of authoritative Source 
  the confirms the VLT number or other legal identify that we might 
  know then you might have a possibility to link the identity but 
  we don't really have any clear solution to that problem yet and I 
  think that will be the biggest the biggest challenge for scaling 
  this up because we couldn't obviously work with an approach where 
  we will need to manually link and.\
Colin_(EQAR):  situations identities and that come with them.\
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> an example, Higher Learning 
  Commission with linked data connections to HE institutions and 
  credentials/qualifications for which accreditation is performed 
  https://credentialfinder.org/organization/403/Higher_Learning_Commission\
Colin_(EQAR): That Leti in the fiber credentials and data 
  acquisition system and the ladder another open issue that we have 
  is of course we vocation and status of credentials where we 
  haven't implemented anything yet but here we presume that this is 
  not going to be a major issue to do because again unlike the 
  actual student diploma student agree use case we do not have any 
  privacy issue.\
Colin_(EQAR):  here so it would be the woman oh.\
Colin_(EQAR): For example to issue a revocation lists that are 
  completely public because that information which accreditation 
  might be revoked with anyway the public by Nature so so I think 
  they had to sum it up really that the biggest challenge we would 
  have to scaling up the use of DACA issued accreditation 
  credentials would really be to identify a higher education 
  institutions on Match their identity in the very fiber.\
Colin_(EQAR):  it's a cool system with that existing identity 
  indica.\
Colin_(EQAR): Thanks for that and look forward to some questions 
  and discussions with you guys.\
Colin_(EQAR): That's correct yes.\
Colin_(EQAR): Well of course it's not register of universities 
  act as a way to stop agencies but then because we are already 
  federating that information from those agencies which Institute 
  which universities and programs they they have quieted that's why 
  we do already have a Federated trust issue a list in a way.\
Colin_(EQAR): So I think that my main but my problem is that we 
  have we have no direct relation with the individual universities 
  so we do have we do gathered information on universities and 
  which of them have been a quality but we don't have a diary I 
  mean it's not that the institutions have any direct contact or 
  login with us or something of that sort.\
Jen_Schreiber: Yeah thanks so much for the great presentation was 
  really interesting and relevant from some other working groups 
  that I'm a part of but could you explain a little bit how the 
  accreditation credential is published or how is that made 
  available to the public.\
Colin_(EQAR): Well at this moment they are they're quite simply 
  make sure they're made available on our website within the DECA 
  database where you find.\
Colin_(EQAR): Imitation information for every accreditation 
  record you would find the corresponding y fiber credential next 
  to it.\
Colin_(EQAR): So it's just sort of thrown out there publicly on 
  the web.\
Jen_Schreiber: Got it but no kind of API endpoint it's all in the 
  gooey.\
<simone_ravaioli_(vc_edu)> @Jen here is a list of EBSI's APIs 
  https://api-pilot.ebsi.eu/docs/apis/trusted-issuers-registry/latest\
Colin_(EQAR): I know that it's actually there is an API there's 
  an API endpoint that we use internally at this moment it's not 
  it's not public but it is going to be very soon I mean it's just 
  because we have we've been testing it for the past couple of 
  months and in the very near future that will be an API endpoint 
  where you can basically directly access their by father.\
<jen_schreiber> thank you!\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Hey everyone so thank you this 
  is this is super interesting not only with regard to our work at 
  credential engine but also because I've been working with and 
  quite hey on their International standards guidelines for Q&A 
  agencies and part of what we surfaced in that work is exactly 
  this type of data the need for trust Registries in terms of.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  who are the Q&A.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Students and how can they serve 
  varying roles and who Q&A is a Q&A organizations right now that's 
  sounds kind of Meta Meta but it's actually super important the 
  the more tactical point I wanted to make here is that this seems 
  like a very logical set of data to use linked open data so the 
  credential.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  conspiracy description.\
<simone_ravaioli_(vc_edu)> btw, more on EQAR and EBSI 
  https://www.eqar.eu/qa-results/synergies/european-blockchain-service-infrastructure-ebsi/\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Language actually provides the 
  structure for this where there's a type of organization it's Q&A 
  organization and then that Q&A organization can actually issue 
  I'm sorry can document quality assurance credentials that they 
  provide to the institutions and part of the beauty of it being 
  linked up and data is the data from the institutions and their 
  information about their credentials comes from the institutions.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  the data from the.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Body comes from the Q&A body 
  but it all gets connected via the linked open data and that can 
  be done with see gdl regardless of where the data resides but 
  also this could the data that you have already could be published 
  to our registry for providing those kinds of connections.\
Colin_(EQAR): So I think you also posted a link in the chat 
  before we didn't you yeah I think we definitely look into that 
  and I think that will be interesting to see where ya explore 
  different ways where we could publish everything from that is on 
  Deck has linked open data where we have been focusing a lot on 
  the European logic model which of course is also.\
Colin_(EQAR):  so linked open data.\
<simone_ravaioli_(vc_edu)> European Learning Model 
  https://github.com/european-commission-empl/European-Learning-Model/tree/ELM-v3\
Colin_(EQAR): Because that of course is our main let's say out 
  our main focus area so sir but we so I think we were yeah they've 
  been following the development of the European learning model 
  quite a lot and we'll work on publishing the Deka date and that 
  format as well.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Yeah everything we can do to 
  get this into linked open data and have data contributors coming 
  to it from multiple angles is very useful thanks.\
Nate_Otto_(he/him): Cool thanks I'm great presentation I'm always 
  very interested in development that are in this area of 
  understanding like why should we trust this particular product 
  credential for this particular purpose could you walk through a 
  little bit from the perspective of a consumer who is the Persona 
  of the consumer of this information presumably someone who is 
  looking at a credential that is in your network and how do they 
  get access like what question are they asking in terms of trust 
  about that credential.\
Nate_Otto_(he/him):  oh and then how does the.\
Nate_Otto_(he/him): That you're presenting answer that question.\
Colin_(EQAR): Yeah I mean the I would say that the consumer will 
  be asking the question okay where's the is the credential well is 
  the credential that I'm seeing where is the institution that I 
  might be studying at is that is that the trustworthy an 
  accredited Institution.\
Colin_(EQAR): Been for me the I would say the biggest challenges 
  okay how do we and I think that in that way that God would give 
  them it's a very well say it's a very binary yes-or-no type of 
  answer because that's the whole European quality assurance 
  framework is also about in that regards a lot about are showing 
  minimum standard so it would just give you the information of 
  courses this is an accredited University in the European higher 
  education area or or.\
Colin_(EQAR):  not it will not give you of course further details 
  or any kind of waiting about the quality.\
Colin_(EQAR): I think the main challenge I see is how okay how do 
  we get that information to the user and how do we connect how do 
  we connect the way fiber credential institution my tissue to a 
  student with the information on the trust information that could 
  come from the car.\
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> this is the INQAAHE 
  international standards and guidelines I referred to-- see pp. 10 
  for the specific reference to the need for trust registries 
  https://www.inqaahe.org/sites/default/files/INQAAHE-International-Standards-and-Guidelines-ISG.pdf\
Colin_(EQAR): Well I mean in Europe of course I'd is in higher 
  education it's in the end it all comes back to the to how they 
  belong and processes govern and that is that is I would start an 
  international organization what is an international inter 
  governmental process you will so you have 4149 - County to so 47 
  countries coming together who at the level of the.\
Colin_(EQAR):  the education ministry's.\
Colin_(EQAR): The common framework and agreed on the on the ESG 
  and okay now we agree on a set of Standards we agree on the role 
  of are kaiser official register of accreditation agencies so in a 
  way they they gave the Mandate of course at International level I 
  think that would be I mean that would get more.\
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> that's an example of QA agreed 
  upon by jurisdiction-- there are also broader global concerns 
  across jurisdictions\
Colin_(EQAR): Of course then you could go for you could imagine 
  like a purely subsidiarity based approach where you say well 
  every every country basically defines who are The Trusted we're 
  just one who are the 12 those in in this country that that can 
  decide on trusted issues in higher education and of course your 
  has the advantage of having already a transnational approach.\
Colin_(EQAR): We need to look at every single country anymore but 
  at International level of course that could be an option of 
  following saying we're finding a solution where every country can 
  published information who are The Trusted issues and that 
  country.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): So that's that's a really good 
  example of where the countries have come together and they've 
  defined the jurisdiction right and then they've defined the 
  quality assurance rules and processes within that jurisdiction 
  and that's typically the way it's done that's not going to go 
  away but there are increasingly needs for cross jurisdictional QA 
  processes in part because.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  cuz people's credentials.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Our need to be more mobile 
  right so if I got a particular license in the EU but then I moved 
  to India what's the meaning of the quality assurance of that 
  credential in in place where I live as distinct from the 
  jurisdiction where it was issued so those types of processes are 
  increasingly important and also that there are increasingly many 
  many credentials that defy jurisdictions.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  so for example.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): If they're issued by a global 
  company or if they're explicitly designed to have transfer value 
  stay from you know one country to another or even from one state 
  to another so my bottom line point I guess is that QA processes 
  are extremely important and.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): In a world where we need these 
  credentials to have meaning globally.\
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> where we can't have clear 
  overall governance, we need as much transparent data as possible 
  to provide guidance and meaning\
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> Do you have a sense of the ways 
  this kind of development is being received, or thought about, by 
  universities and higher ed institutions? Basically, are higher ed 
  officials creating strategies for integrating credentials into 
  their systems?\
Colin_(EQAR): Yeah that was my fault thanks yeah I just thought 
  because I it that's a single question and to be honest I'm not 
  100% sure in I mean not even in Europe to what extent hi I mean 
  how Keen higher education institutions and universities are on 
  average to adopting very fabric redemptions or digital 
  credentials of any sort them in their strategy I mean.\
Colin_(EQAR):  on the one and of course we used.\
Colin_(EQAR): U.s. the u.s. pushing an infrastructure and 
  developing an infrastructure to allow institutions to do that but 
  I don't have any clear information yet on whether yeah how how 
  fast I would see higher education institutions to take that up or 
  not I think it also depends a lot on what do they see is them and 
  for them I mean of course if there is a mite.\
Colin_(EQAR):  it might be attractive to higher education.\
Colin_(EQAR): But of course that it will also depend on how much 
  students will be asking for and how much students will be asked 
  for having the deter very fiber credentials instead of 
  traditional paper degrees so yeah hard to say I'm fine for now.\
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> thank you - we are 
  seeing/experiencing much of the same in the US.\
Colin_(EQAR): So I just raised my hand once again for on the 
  governance well say the governance question of international 
  level and I do agree with what you said before that it's more of 
  a government's issued under attack issue of course and Europe 
  will has been kind of easy I would say because we do have an 
  established governing structure at the European level and the 
  international level you said yeah you have your lesko and letting 
  on the one and it will make sense.\
Colin_(EQAR):  how to use your mask.\
Colin_(EQAR): Thought formal to discuss this matters within the 
  UNESCO context also in relation to the global convention because 
  I would always say well it's we shouldn't we shouldn't invent a 
  new governing structure just because of a new tank but we should 
  use the existing and establish governing structures and somehow 
  connect them with the new tech rather than trying to invent a new 
  governing structure but of course at the European level and so we 
  had the international number might be more tricky because there 
  is not.\
Colin_(EQAR):  I mean UNESCO is there but on the other hand 
  UNESCO is not governing an.\
<kaliya_identitywoman> Did GCCN come up as a meta directory or 
  registries?\
Colin_(EQAR): Coastal area and in such a practical sounds I said 
  say the European higher education area is governed by its 
  governing structure so I think that that maybe makes it complex 
  that on the one hand I think we should invent a new governing 
  structure on the other hand there's not really an existing one at 
  European level.\
Colin_(EQAR): Sorry at the international level.\
Colin_(EQAR): Yeah so I'm what is the gcn among.\
Kaliya Young:  So it's the sum I'm not directly involved in this 
  project but my close colleague Lucy Young on John Walker have 
  been leading it GCC on is stands for Global covid certificate 
  network but they've been working with undp and who.\
Kaliya Young:   To build a kind of.\
Kaliya Young:  Our directory of trust Registries infrastructure 
  using train.\
Kaliya Young:  Come on the technology side of like how do you if 
  you have trust Registries plural across the globe how do you find 
  them and potentially you could use this infrastructure to list 
  registries.\
Kaliya Young:  Lucy's here since it's me first.\
Lucy Yang:  I thought monster thank you clear for bringing you up 
  I was listening I was think so what we're clear Mansion is what 
  my colleague Ann and I were doing an initially from the covet and 
  from Linux foundation and we recently moved to the United Nations 
  development programme and work on that in collaboration with the 
  who while because I believe shows working with the different 
  large networks of Cobra credentials and now I'm moving beyond 
  covid credentials.\
Lucy Yang:   Stand figure out how different kind of network and.\
Lucy Yang:  At the middle of Alaska we mentioned and one of the 
  things I think probably someone is about to say like we leverage 
  training because train use idns DNS attack so by leveraging 
  existing like infrastructure that everyone probably has using 
  especially government and companies and how we can leverage that 
  infrastructure to actually help those different ecosystems just 
  being discovered in a trusted manner at other Global level we're 
  just a matter level because there are going to be more and more.\
Lucy Yang:  Registries I think especially that's what we're 
  seeing in the education sector I wasn't one of like that 
  discussion I think two weeks ago there's some your Yura eura 
  initiative in the you their small University kind of Consortium 
  or ensuring credentials are talking about their preferring more 
  kind of smaller networks and you know kind of rough trust 
  Registries instead of like a bigger one so what you're going to 
  do when you have so many of them out there and how you kind of 
  being able to kind of cut.\
Lucy Yang:   Discover them and knowing that they're be sure that 
  they're safe.\
Lucy Yang:  Who they are.\
Lucy Yang:  And help them connect you know doing key exchanges 
  and other thing that's what we're pretty much doing for covid and 
  but now I also expanding to other areas of of use cases happy to 
  share more information we're about to launch at the openly like 
  this but specification and an open source kind of core 
  infrastructure and in early January so happy to either present or 
  share more on this forum like when we have more information to 
  share.\
<colin_(eqar)> @Lucy & Kaliya, sounds definitely interesting!\
Colin_(EQAR): The things that definitely sounds interesting I 
  believe me can I ask you a question back basically what is the 
  governance model or what's the decision model behind it I mean is 
  it basically it's a eventually boils down to a peer-to-peer 
  decision like every one eventually decides who Mel's they trust 
  or what is the governance well yeah once the governance model 
  behind it.\
Lucy Yang:  I can respond if so so this is a question is not is 
  just to be solved so we at least our work was started was 
  technology and looking at existing because all the to covid not 
  work we work with they're already in production so we're looking 
  at their existing unprocess existing governance but idea is at 
  the meta level is too.\
Lucy Yang:   Because needs to be governed more.\
Lucy Yang:  In a decentralized way in a sense of what we're 
  looking at is we're not asking everyone to follow a very kind of 
  comprehensive kind of governance but in but more in the sense 
  that you have your own governance but to be participating to be 
  discovered a meta level there are certain set of information you 
  need to provide regardless of your governance and that 
  information for example like who you are right and you know and 
  some of like the document you were providing we like the matter 
  platform needs to validate.\
Lucy Yang:   Are you saying who you are and also are those 
  informations are kind of legit.\
Lucy Yang:  In from you so the matter what network is not saying 
  that you'll just continue to do this and that because you can't 
  do what you have to give them kind of their own like especially 
  nation state or sovereignty but the same time being validating 
  the trust information on the matter platform so this is the next 
  step we're about to pick off a consultation period at the undp 
  and in early in the first quarter of of next year so that 
  hopefully this is something because we have figure out a lot of 
  Technology requirements very very practical.\
Lucy Yang:   Ones and Next Step needs to be figure out some look 
  like the foundational governance piece and part reason why were 
  using covid as.\
Lucy Yang:  Not like the first use.\
Lucy Yang:  This is because a lot of things are real or not just 
  a hypothetical so hopefully we have more to share it was just 
  group as we progress thank you.\
