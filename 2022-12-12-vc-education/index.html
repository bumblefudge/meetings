<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="information">Colin_(EQAR): For the public and because we thought okay we do have a common framework so we need to have also the information on who has been accredited in line with that agreed framework in one place and in one comparable format especially if there was a specially created for the purposes of furthering recognition and automatic recognition within the European area but I think it&apos;s something that comes in very hard for now on trying to link.\ <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="information">Colin_(EQAR): Higher education institutions and programs so since we already have data for so many countries in a standardized format it of course seems quite logical to go through us to to connect those to the very fiber credentials echo system to make sure that quality assurance data can be easily used in in the field of digital credentials I&apos;m going to say a few words about linking.\ <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="information">Colin_(EQAR): Canvas with the European digital credentials for learning initiative which is an EU initiative and that is currently not based on verifiable credentials but as far as we understand that might that might change in the future and that is just to to illustrate briefly that we have also other digital credentials existence where Deca data is already linked to but so is so the European digital credentials initiative is based on.\ <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="information">Colin_(EQAR): In this is if it&apos;s based on every country providing a list of accredited education providers so in that case there&apos;s basically a poor country export of data from decorated that countries can use to to feed that information into the European digital credentials ecosystem and once they do that it can be used in a standardized way but I&apos;m not going to go into details with that but rather say a few words about linking duck under verifiable credentials are.\ <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="information">Colin_(EQAR):  assisting with is as Somalia said being inspired.\ <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="information">Colin_(EQAR): Pepsi or initiative but I do want to underline that is of course not limited to AB c-- for us because in a way AB C AB c-- was the first concrete starting point where we were that made us think about linking DACA to verifiable credentials and expressing data from that caused by fiber credentials but we also soon realize that that is not that that should not be limited to AB c-- and that of course.\ <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="information">Colin_(EQAR): So in FCS some of you probably know the the general idea is that quality assurance a quotation results itself is also expressed as a very fiber credential in our case the issue of that accreditation cadential would be would be a cow in a way it&apos;s we are not as such the issue of the accreditation because we are not accredited education institutions that.\ <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="information">Colin_(EQAR): So in this case we will be acting as a proxy for the accredited agencies to issue by fiber credentials and they would of course be issued to the higher education institution that is accredited with some details in a about the scope or specific program study program or degree that is accredited of course we have I think we have.\ <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="information">Colin_(EQAR): With a quotation credentials you have one ones say one advantage of one aspect that makes some things rather simple for us because all the data all the information we are talking about is public by Nature so privacy is not really an issue at all for an accreditation could ensure so we are our approach to files being to basically offer well.\ <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
