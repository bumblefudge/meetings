[2024-05-21T16:08:00.952Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Let's get to the main agenda so today uh the main agenda is on credentials format comparison and we're very glad to have uh Miracle Lucy uh in Korea to kind of join us uh to present their work.
[2024-05-21T16:08:01.588Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang:  so miracle.
[2024-05-21T16:08:23.533Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Yep that would be great I think that that makes sense in terms of the the the flow to go from simpler to more complex.
[2024-05-21T16:08:26.007Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Um okay I.
[2024-05-21T16:08:29.562Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Uh okay I'm.
[2024-05-21T16:08:41.107Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: I would like okay uh oh Google Chrome would like to record this computer screens audio I guess so.
[2024-05-21T16:08:50.623Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Sorry it's asking me to do things I didn't really know.
[2024-05-21T16:09:24.046Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Maybe miracle if you could uh just kind of introduce yourself a little bit I know you're doing uh great work uh that uh other foundation so.
[2024-05-21T16:09:24.408Z]	<Kaliya_Identity_Woman>	present+
[2024-05-21T16:10:01.921Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: All righty great thank you so much um so.
[2024-05-21T16:10:20.003Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: I'm gonna share out this paper and the previous paper that Lucy and I wrote um called standards based digital credential flavors explained uh we were sponsored to do this work by.
[2024-05-21T16:10:28.976Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: DHI the crown Corporation for the country of Bhutan that's led the development of their um.
[2024-05-21T16:10:33.951Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Digital credential um system.
[2024-05-21T16:10:40.979Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: And we work with companies to do sponsored work like this where.
[2024-05-21T16:10:45.454Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Information would be good for the whole market and folks um.
[2024-05-21T16:10:45.736Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman:  pay us to do.
[2024-05-21T16:10:48.480Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: The research and and share it.
[2024-05-21T16:11:30.165Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Um you can see um this was the purpose of the project to provide a simplified but Tech technically accurate overview of the main flavors of C based digital credentials for humans in the market today to inform policy business and Technical decision makers on the fence regarding what to use for their implementations um the purpose of of why we did this and we did not um we did not choose to focus on every possible flavor Under the Sun we focused on what was what was in market and being used.
[2024-05-21T16:11:40.049Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: So the first version of the paper was written when Lucy and I worked for the coid credentials initiative under Linux Foundation Public Health.
[2024-05-21T16:11:45.889Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: In 2001 and covered.
[2024-05-21T16:11:58.398Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Uh 4 major flavors and took them through a journey of the life cycle and sort of articulated how each flavor was different in in each stage of the life cycle.
[2024-05-21T16:12:01.914Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: We evolved this paper.
[2024-05-21T16:12:18.325Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: For the next version in 23 and we um split it up into some new sections the top section cover data formats so Json Json LD and core.
[2024-05-21T16:12:28.512Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: And then section covered different cryptographic securing methods JWT cwt and data Integrity proof.
[2024-05-21T16:12:38.042Z]	<Nate_Otto>	present+
[2024-05-21T16:12:42.581Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: And then we also went through some key capabilities like selective disclosure and explained how those worked along with subject holder binding and Hardware binding.
[2024-05-21T16:12:52.427Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Then we went through the same steps that we had in the first paper sort of the life cycle of a credential from issue to.
[2024-05-21T16:13:09.526Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Covering 4 different flavors and then at the very end we touch on 2 of the flavors that we dropped from this paper the a non-red flow and um what was called.
[2024-05-21T16:13:21.736Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Jason ldz KP with BBs plus called BBS with data Integrity signatures and 2 New Kids on the Block we touched on um.
[2024-05-21T16:13:33.362Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Authentic chain data containers acdt and gordian envelopes and then we discussed how most of zks is.
[2024-05-21T16:13:36.851Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: That are in the real world or.
[2024-05-21T16:13:48.326Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Pseudo zks were statements are signed but the actual cryptographic sort of math properties aren't happening so that's the difference in the 2 table of contacts.
[2024-05-21T16:13:48.628Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman:  I thought I'd.
[2024-05-21T16:13:54.477Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Walk through sort of some of the content of the paper.
[2024-05-21T16:13:58.577Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Is this difference between Json and Json LD.
[2024-05-21T16:14:14.983Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: On the left hand side is Json it's just name value Pairs and on the right is Json LD that has um an app context file that points to schema.org and you can see below is.
[2024-05-21T16:14:23.000Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: The reference in this is drawn directly from the schema.org um.
[2024-05-21T16:14:25.984Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Website and the.
[2024-05-21T16:14:39.510Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: The context um sort of map for birth date in this schema is the schema.org birthday right so it's a way to reference.
[2024-05-21T16:14:51.664Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Using Uris specific data fields so that meaning can be determined and 1 of the things is also that provides the potential to do language mapping so you could.
[2024-05-21T16:15:01.111Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Have assert that this is a birth date in Chinese or Hindi or Thai or whatever language you want and.
[2024-05-21T16:15:01.306Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman:  and you.
[2024-05-21T16:15:06.165Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Could figure out that it was referencing a birth date so it's it's good for the.
[2024-05-21T16:15:09.615Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Multilingual World we're moving into.
[2024-05-21T16:15:35.350Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Then this is an example of severe so we just took the Seymour that was on the left on the previous screen and translated into sibur and so this is basically all the words in the that's in the paper because it would be lots of numbers if we kept going with it but it gives you kind of a tangible example of these 3 different data formats that are being used in credentials.
[2024-05-21T16:15:35.709Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman:  and then.
[2024-05-21T16:15:36.305Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: And we have.
[2024-05-21T16:15:41.316Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Happening infographic that we made um.
[2024-05-21T16:15:45.804Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: And so I just thought a good.
[2024-05-21T16:15:46.082Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman:  thing to.
[2024-05-21T16:15:55.182Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Share would be some of would be these infographics for us to look at we did Json signed with a JWT.
[2024-05-21T16:16:01.617Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: The whole thing is signed all of all together.
[2024-05-21T16:16:05.336Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: There is no selective disclosure capability.
[2024-05-21T16:16:20.542Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: On the right hand side you have Json LD with data Integrity proofs very similarly the whole all the information of the credential is signed together external link to go and be able to do.
[2024-05-21T16:16:23.951Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Um resolution of what the.
[2024-05-21T16:16:28.497Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Names in the name value pairs actually means.
[2024-05-21T16:16:37.801Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Then we have the 2 formats that supports ISO MDOC mdl.
[2024-05-21T16:16:57.385Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Um basically that the top is the the sort of what happens with the issuance of the credential and the bottom is what happens with the presentation of the credential so that um.
[2024-05-21T16:17:12.236Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: The individual is able to share some of the values and and doesn't have to share all of them.
[2024-05-21T16:17:26.252Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Um with estie JWT hashes of the values are signed and disclosure object are given to the individual and when they share those disclosure objects.
[2024-05-21T16:17:33.659Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Combined with the hashes the information becomes viewable by.
[2024-05-21T16:17:44.766Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Verifier so these are 2 different strategies that are quite similar to achieve the same thing which is selective disclosure.
[2024-05-21T16:17:55.763Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: And then finally the infographic uh included the 2 pets that were in the earlier paper data Integrity with BBs Plus.
[2024-05-21T16:18:03.232Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Of showing that you each value is signed separately and that the holder can.
[2024-05-21T16:18:10.257Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Name value Pairs and the signatures.
[2024-05-21T16:18:16.734Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: And a non-red also um has a similar architecture.
[2024-05-21T16:18:33.226Z]	<PL/T3>	present+
[2024-05-21T16:18:40.660Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: So those are the formats covered in the paper and um maybe that's all I have to share and um I'm happy to take a few questions if people have any before or we can just go on to next doesn't matter to me let me stop sharing I'm not sure their stop sharing okay great.
[2024-05-21T16:19:02.563Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Any questions on the what Kia has presented.
[2024-05-21T16:19:22.857Z]	<Kaliya_Identity_Woman>	Here is where you get the paper - https://medium.com/@identitywoman-in-business/new-paper-and-infographic-on-flavors-of-digital-credentials-released-b9b6ec5b95af
[2024-05-21T16:19:54.285Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Yes looks great.

[2024-05-21T16:30:10.642Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: So a quick question um so what's next like uh what's the next phase other than like Gathering inputs and then like complete this further what's the next phase phase on this project.
[2024-05-21T16:31:56.921Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you.
[2024-05-21T16:32:02.510Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: And do you have a I know this is to do but do you have a hunch on what are the.
[2024-05-21T16:32:02.832Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang:  uh for.
[2024-05-21T16:32:13.595Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Mats or uh protocols that that that has the biggest market share were poised to uh to have the biggest market share.
[2024-05-21T16:34:54.510Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: No I agree with your comments I do think Simplicity helps uh adoptions as well so thank you.
[2024-05-21T16:34:58.938Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: I think that I you know I.
[2024-05-21T16:35:02.294Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Pretty clear we're going to live in a multi.
[2024-05-21T16:35:15.661Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: Um there are really legitimate reasons for a different choices.
[2024-05-21T16:35:21.129Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: And I think yeah so.
[2024-05-21T16:35:21.592Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman:  I I.
[2024-05-21T16:35:22.146Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: I don't think.
[2024-05-21T16:35:31.148Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: 1 format to rule them all I do think that we will have several formats that have different trade-offs.
[2024-05-21T16:35:35.116Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya_Identity_Woman: For different reasons and that's fine.
[2024-05-21T16:36:15.664Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Great um any questions in regards to any of the formats or.
[2024-05-21T16:36:18.757Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Technology or the comparisons.
[2024-05-21T16:36:21.866Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q?
