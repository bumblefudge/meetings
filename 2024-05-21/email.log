Harrison_Tang: All right any updates on the work items.
Harrison_Tang: All right last call is for introductions 
  announcements reminders and work items.
Harrison_Tang: Let's get to the main agenda so today uh the main 
  agenda is on credentials format comparison and we're very glad to 
  have uh Miracle Lucy uh in Korea to kind of join us uh to present 
  their work.
Harrison_Tang:  so miracle.
Kaliya Young:  Yep that would be great I think that that makes 
  sense in terms of the the the flow to go from simpler to more 
  complex.
Kaliya Young:  Um okay I.
Kaliya Young:  Uh okay I'm.
Kaliya Young:  I would like okay uh oh Google Chrome would like 
  to record this computer screens audio I guess so.
Kaliya Young:  Sorry it's asking me to do things I didn't really 
  know.
Harrison_Tang: Maybe miracle if you could uh just kind of 
  introduce yourself a little bit I know you're doing uh great work 
  uh that uh other foundation so.
Kaliya Young:  All righty great thank you so much um so.
Kaliya Young:  I'm gonna share out this paper and the previous 
  paper that Lucy and I wrote um called standards based digital 
  credential flavors explained uh we were sponsored to do this work 
  by.
Kaliya Young:  DHI the crown Corporation for the country of 
  Bhutan that's led the development of their um.
Kaliya Young:  Digital credential um system.
Kaliya Young:  And we work with companies to do sponsored work 
  like this where.
Kaliya Young:  Information would be good for the whole market and 
  folks um.
Kaliya Young:   Pay us to do.
Kaliya Young:  The research and and share it.
Kaliya Young:  Um you can see um this was the purpose of the 
  project to provide a simplified but Tech technically accurate 
  overview of the main flavors of C based digital credentials for 
  humans in the market today to inform policy business and 
  Technical decision makers on the fence regarding what to use for 
  their implementations um the purpose of of why we did this and we 
  did not um we did not choose to focus on every possible flavor 
  Under the Sun we focused on what was what was in market and being 
  used.
Kaliya Young:  So the first version of the paper was written when 
  Lucy and I worked for the coid credentials initiative under Linux 
  Foundation Public Health.
Kaliya Young:  In 2001 and covered.
Kaliya Young:  Uh 4 major flavors and took them through a journey 
  of the life cycle and sort of articulated how each flavor was 
  different in in each stage of the life cycle.
Kaliya Young:  We evolved this paper.
Kaliya Young:  For the next version in 23 and we um split it up 
  into some new sections the top section cover data formats so Json 
  Json LD and core.
Kaliya Young:  And then section covered different cryptographic 
  securing methods JWT cwt and data Integrity proof.
Kaliya Young:  And then we also went through some key 
  capabilities like selective disclosure and explained how those 
  worked along with subject holder binding and Hardware binding.
Kaliya Young:  Then we went through the same steps that we had in 
  the first paper sort of the life cycle of a credential from issue 
  to.
Kaliya Young:  Covering 4 different flavors and then at the very 
  end we touch on 2 of the flavors that we dropped from this paper 
  the a non-red flow and um what was called.
Kaliya Young:  Jason ldz KP with BBs plus called BBS with data 
  Integrity signatures and 2 New Kids on the Block we touched on 
  um.
Kaliya Young:  Authentic chain data containers acdt and gordian 
  envelopes and then we discussed how most of zks is.
Kaliya Young:  That are in the real world or.
Kaliya Young:  Pseudo zks were statements are signed but the 
  actual cryptographic sort of math properties aren't happening so 
  that's the difference in the 2 table of contacts.
Kaliya Young:   I thought I'd.
Kaliya Young:  Walk through sort of some of the content of the 
  paper.
Kaliya Young:  Is this difference between Json and Json LD.
Kaliya Young:  On the left hand side is Json it's just name value 
  Pairs and on the right is Json LD that has um an app context file 
  that points to schema.org and you can see below is.
Kaliya Young:  The reference in this is drawn directly from the 
  schema.org um.
Kaliya Young:  Website and the.
Kaliya Young:  The context um sort of map for birth date in this 
  schema is the schema.org birthday right so it's a way to 
  reference.
Kaliya Young:  Using Uris specific data fields so that meaning 
  can be determined and 1 of the things is also that provides the 
  potential to do language mapping so you could.
Kaliya Young:  Have assert that this is a birth date in Chinese 
  or Hindi or Thai or whatever language you want and.
Kaliya Young:   And you.
Kaliya Young:  Could figure out that it was referencing a birth 
  date so it's it's good for the.
Kaliya Young:  Multilingual World we're moving into.
Kaliya Young:  Then this is an example of severe so we just took 
  the Seymour that was on the left on the previous screen and 
  translated into sibur and so this is basically all the words in 
  the that's in the paper because it would be lots of numbers if we 
  kept going with it but it gives you kind of a tangible example of 
  these 3 different data formats that are being used in 
  credentials.
Kaliya Young:   And then.
Kaliya Young:  And we have.
Kaliya Young:  Happening infographic that we made um.
Kaliya Young:  And so I just thought a good.
Kaliya Young:   Thing to.
Kaliya Young:  Share would be some of would be these infographics 
  for us to look at we did Json signed with a JWT.
Kaliya Young:  The whole thing is signed all of all together.
Kaliya Young:  There is no selective disclosure capability.
Kaliya Young:  On the right hand side you have Json LD with data 
  Integrity proofs very similarly the whole all the information of 
  the credential is signed together external link to go and be able 
  to do.
Kaliya Young:  Um resolution of what the.
Kaliya Young:  Names in the name value pairs actually means.
Kaliya Young:  Then we have the 2 formats that supports ISO MDOC 
  mdl.
Kaliya Young:  Um basically that the top is the the sort of what 
  happens with the issuance of the credential and the bottom is 
  what happens with the presentation of the credential so that um.
Kaliya Young:  The individual is able to share some of the values 
  and and doesn't have to share all of them.
Kaliya Young:  Um with estie JWT hashes of the values are signed 
  and disclosure object are given to the individual and when they 
  share those disclosure objects.
Kaliya Young:  Combined with the hashes the information becomes 
  viewable by.
Kaliya Young:  Verifier so these are 2 different strategies that 
  are quite similar to achieve the same thing which is selective 
  disclosure.
Kaliya Young:  And then finally the infographic uh included the 2 
  pets that were in the earlier paper data Integrity with BBs Plus.
Kaliya Young:  Of showing that you each value is signed 
  separately and that the holder can.
Kaliya Young:  Name value Pairs and the signatures.
Kaliya Young:  And a non-red also um has a similar architecture.
Kaliya Young:  So those are the formats covered in the paper and 
  um maybe that's all I have to share and um I'm happy to take a 
  few questions if people have any before or we can just go on to 
  next doesn't matter to me let me stop sharing I'm not sure their 
  stop sharing okay great.
Harrison_Tang: Any questions on the what Kia has presented.
<kaliya_identity_woman> Here is where you get the paper - 
  https://medium.com/@identitywoman-in-business/new-paper-and-infographic-on-flavors-of-digital-credentials-released-b9b6ec5b95af
Harrison_Tang: Yes looks great.
Harrison_Tang: So any comments or questions.
Harrison_Tang: So a quick question um so what's next like uh 
  what's the next phase other than like Gathering inputs and then 
  like complete this further what's the next phase phase on this 
  project.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you.
Harrison_Tang: And do you have a I know this is to do but do you 
  have a hunch on what are the.
Harrison_Tang:  uh for.
Harrison_Tang: Mats or uh protocols that that that has the 
  biggest market share were poised to uh to have the biggest market 
  share.
Harrison_Tang: No I agree with your comments I do think 
  Simplicity helps uh adoptions as well so thank you.
Kaliya Young:  I think that I you know I.
Kaliya Young:  Pretty clear we're going to live in a multi.
Kaliya Young:  Um there are really legitimate reasons for a 
  different choices.
Kaliya Young:  And I think yeah so.
Kaliya Young:   I I.
Kaliya Young:  I don't think.
Kaliya Young:  1 Format to rule them all I do think that we will 
  have several formats that have different trade-offs.
Kaliya Young:  For different reasons and that's fine.
Harrison_Tang: Great um any questions in regards to any of the 
  formats or.
Harrison_Tang: Technology or the comparisons.
Nate Otto:  Hey thanks this is a really cool resource um first of 
  all um I'm curious about the.
https://openwallet-foundation.github.io/credential-format-comparison-sig/#/
Nate Otto:  Internals of the claim structure as well um.
Nate Otto:  What space does this tool have to talk about the 
  different types of claims that might be made in various different 
  um profiles is that a direction that you're interested in 
  exploring or is that.
Nate Otto:  Up way too much and would be out of scope or 
  unmanageable.
Nate Otto:  Sure so a lot of the um comparison that we're seeing 
  here is at the kind of the envelope of the uh.
Nate Otto:  Credential not about what.
Nate Otto:  Specific claims the issuers are making about holders 
  or recipients um are you interested in covering.
Nate Otto:  Specific claims like uh you know for example uh 
  whether achievements were made skills were held birth dates uh 
  degrees.
Nate Otto:  That type of level of.
Nate Otto:  Content in this comparison or is that out of scope.
Harrison_Tang: Simone you're next.
Harrison_Tang: Any other questions.
Harrison_Tang: Last call for questions.
Harrison_Tang: All right well thank you thank you Mo thank you 
  can uh Clea for coming on and presenting your work this is 
  definitely very interesting and definitely a very important work 
  to uh showcase all the different options and help users uh or uh 
  the decision makers uh make a more informed decisions on what the 
  appropriate Technologies to use so thanks a lot.
Harrison_Tang: All right so I think this concludes uh this week's 
  w3c ccg meeting and uh.
Harrison_Tang: Will see you next week thanks a lot.
