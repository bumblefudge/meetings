<simone_ravaioli> Good morning, good afternoon everyone. This is 
  Simone speaking, today chairing our Monday call with the W3C 
  Verifiable Credentials for Education task force. Today is June 
  the 3rd. Let's just get started with the housekeeping items. IP 
  Note: Anyone can participate in these calls. However, all 
  substantive contributions to any Credentials Community Group Work 
  Items must originate from members of the CCG with full IPR 
  agreements signed. You can find the link to this in the meeting 
  invites. You'll need to have a W3C account, that is also 
  something easy to do online. Moving on to call notes. Please note 
  that these meetings are recorded. We have a robot transcriber and 
  we also make audio and video recordings, that are archived and 
  available online. If you want to speak, please raise your hand, 
  or add yourself to the queue by typing “q+” in the chat. And 
  please be brief if you have a question to ask, we want to 
  maximise the time for conversations. Thank you. Now to 
  Introductions & Reintroductions. If we have any new people in the 
  call, or somebody would like to reintroduce themselves, please 
  feel free to take the floor. If nobody wants to take the floor, 
  we can move on to announcements and reminders. Anyone has events 
  or things that happened that people should be aware of, again, 
  please queue yourself up and share the news with us. Now we can 
  move on to the main agenda topic, that is Learning and Employment 
  Record Resume Standard (LER-RS).

<pl/t3> Thanks for the link Deb
<dmitri_zagidulin> we can hear you, but it sounds like you can't 
  hear us
<ildiko_mazar> We can hear you
<ildiko_mazar> Yes, we can hear you.
<dmitri_zagidulin> we can still hear you
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
PL/T3: 1 of which uh some of which are listed here it's tamper 
  evidence it's um certainty of the whole wallet holder's identity 
  I put a big star around that and we'll come come back to that 
  clear descriptions of the claims skills.
PL/T3: Structured data link data references to standards and 
  Frameworks uh potentially 4 things like competencies and skills.
PL/T3: Of asking for what sought in what scent meaning there's a 
  mechanism by which a relying party can make a request for 
  credentials and the the holder of the credentials can make a 
  decision about whether to share them or not and that's sort of 
  the core set of of attributes.
PL/T3: The current state of these vrs is really uh sort of 
  twofold 1 is the ability to send a group or stack of credentials 
  1 or more in a verifiable presentation to an endpoint such as a 
  credential wallet or some other endpoint.
PL/T3: On arrival they are an independent unordered set of in of 
  credentials that is a verifiable credentials the relying party 
  can ha does have agency to choose what gets put into the package 
  that is sent.
PL/T3: That's their their agency that they have the actual 
  initiation of the request comes from the relying party 
  themselves.
PL/T3: The second alternative a poet for sending credentials um 
  is that 1 can send a compound credential where that is 
  credentials embedded within a credential and that's the model of 
  the CLR V2.
PL/T3: The outer credential envelope.
PL/T3: Um is a signed document a signed credential which uh has 
  metadata.
PL/T3: Then there are embedded credential objects in this case 
  with clrv 2 obv 3s open badge version 3s single assertion 
  credentials.
PL/T3: Um they are used in the case of the crv20001.
PL/T3:  the package.
PL/T3: A hole can be signed and the obvious can be left unsigned 
  if the institution wishes that's issuing.
PL/T3: Or they can both be signed.
PL/T3: Um as as in doing so allowing the individual obvious to be 
  separately verified if they are uh if the individual who was a 
  recipient of them wishes to do so.
PL/T3: The composed credentials neither of these approaches.
PL/T3: The holder or.
PL/T3: Or the school at the job the holder.
PL/T3: For either a job or a school application the ability to 
  orchestrate the sequence of their credentials to the relying 
  party highlighting what the holder may want to emphasize and I 
  mentioned that simply because.
PL/T3: That's the current state when you get a stack of obvious 
  threes in a VP.
PL/T3: Then those credentials are there for the individual 
  relying party to look at as they wish or not in any order they 
  wish or not and that's the same as uh a true of the uh of the 
  compost conventional as well.
PL/T3: Why does this matter now.
PL/T3: Well because we're increasingly needing to use the 
  capabilities of linked claim of verifiable credentials and Link 
  claims is a particular framework for doing so for a particular 
  population which I'll get to so there's the obvious concern today 
  with respect to the of validity of credentials in terms of their 
  are they actually from somebody that's real um to what extent are 
  these credentials uh fabricated and not associated with the uh an 
  issue or that uh that you can identify in some fashion.
PL/T3: Um and most importantly from our perspective.
PL/T3: There is an entire segment of the population that is 
  likely not to have issued credentials from an institution or 
  training body.
PL/T3: Um or from an employer who has the ability.
PL/T3: The present time none are exercising at this point to 
  credential their own workers.
PL/T3: So the self-employed the non-traditional workers those who 
  are in small businesses that can't afford the infrastructure 
  necessary to issue and or process verify the credentials um 
  constitute a population for whom our current architecture and 
  design essentially overlooks.
PL/T3: So with the interest in skills-based hiring and 
  advancement.
PL/T3: We are interested in putting a surgeons of credentials.
PL/T3: Endorsements in the same secure verifiable context as 
  assertions of achievements licenses and other uh verifiable 
  credentials like degrees.
PL/T3: We want to mirror the pattern of social recommendations 
  currently used for job applications and resumes.
PL/T3: Where typically you send in a CV or a or a resume and at 
  the bottom you list 4 or 5.
PL/T3: Whom you suggest as recommendations to support the 
  contents of your application and the validity of your of your 
  resume or CV.
PL/T3: But we'd like to do that with the same architectural 
  framework that VCS and general possess.
PL/T3: And more importantly we'd like to make sure that they're 
  recommending credential is designed specifically for that purpose 
  that is it contains bonafides so that the relying party can judge 
  the recommenders knowledge and the value to uh that the 
  recommender is suggesting in terms of the prediction of the 
  ability of that particular applicant to do the work the job is 
  that the job requires.
PL/T3: So to do that we need recommendations that allow you to 
  bind together 2 different verifiable credentials.
PL/T3:  in a.
PL/T3: Way that is.
PL/T3: 1 credential to the other that that link between the 2 is 
  tamper evident.
PL/T3: We also want to be able to bind in a tamper evident 
  fashion links to digital objects that are somewhere out on the 
  internet for example evidence that you might have and you've 
  placed it in say a Google Drive you'd like a link from your 
  credential to that evidence in that Google Drive that is 
  temporary evident in the sense that since that love that evidence 
  was placed in that Google drive it has not been changed.
PL/T3: And we'd like a method to provide confidence in the 
  credential subject that that credential subject particularly the 
  self issuer is who they say they are there's an asterisk by that 
  because that is part of the future work which I'll get to at the 
  very end.
PL/T3: The general framework um I'll pause for a second so I 
  can't see speaker notes if there are any questions at this stage.
PL/T3: Um or common metric or Karen as to my intro.
PL/T3: And I'm hearing nothing.
<dmitri_zagidulin> no questions so far
Karen O'Donoghue:  Nothing for me I thought that was a really 
  good intro thank you.
PL/T3: So maybe I should stop sharing.
<dmitri_zagidulin> we can hear you though
PL/T3: Stop sharing for a second.
PL/T3: Can you all was were you able to hear me through that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We were able to hear you.
<simone_ravaioli> Yes we heard you.
<kayode_ezike> Yes, we can hear you Phil
<ildiko_mazar> Can you please explain Phil what the significance 
  is of ordering/sequencing the credentials and what makes it not 
  possible?
PL/T3: Okay were there any questions because I'm not hearing 
  audio from anybody at this point.
<simone_ravaioli> No questions
<karen_passmore> Nothing from me at this time
PL/T3: Okay I see a question that eidos mentioned can you please 
  explain what the significance is of ordering and sequencing the 
  credentials and what what uh makes it not possible.
PL/T3: Issue is not that they can't be.
PL/T3: That an individual can't choose to click through them.
PL/T3: Uh as they wish the issue is that the the um.
PL/T3: The person that has sent the credentials that is to say 
  the person who is the credential subject the person whom the 
  credentials are about does not have a way for indicating to the 
  relying party the order and the focus of the credentials that 
  they're receiving.
PL/T3: That is I can't.
PL/T3: The relying party I'd like you to go in this order with 
  these credentials.
<ildiko_mazar> Is that a credential FORMAT limitation or a DESIGN 
  feature?
PL/T3: Um I can't say that within a given credential I would like 
  to highlight these particular elements potentially relevant in my 
  view to the application that I am applying for or the position 
  I'm applying for ETC none of that is possible I can simply 
  present the credentials in the context of the combined credential 
  uh in the CLR V2 fashion there may be the opportunity for these 
  things to be grouped in a standard way based on some template 
  that represents what we think of as a resume or a CV but I'm not 
  in any way able to point.
PL/T3: Sequence of going through those uh to the relying party or 
  say anything about uh the evidence or other elements in those 
  credentials I would like to highlight.
PL/T3: I hope that addresses the question.
PL/T3: What else do we have here uh.
PL/T3: And these questions are coming in faster than I can 
  respond to them.
PL/T3: Demitri do you want to take some of these uh because I've 
  got to get my audio fixed because I am hearing nothing.
<dmitri_zagidulin> sure
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sure yeah so uh the 1 Thing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That I would mention.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh to iOS follow-up question of is this a 
  credential format limitation or a design feature uh it's 
  basically a a question of whether the issuer arranges it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Or can the receiver arrange it right that's 
  that's the main design question its.
PL/T3: Because I question.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   This is the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This is the general Choice design choice 
  between.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Kitchen sink credentials like your full 
  transcript versus.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Pending individual credentials of your courses 
  and allowing you to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Um compose them into some of them into resumes 
  uh into other credentials right so it's just.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh uh single picture versus uh puzzle pieces.
PL/T3: And I've got your audio now so I'm you can hear me.
<ildiko_mazar> :+1:
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh good good yeah we can hear you welcome 
  back.
PL/T3: Okay weird um okay so I will go back is there anything 
  else in the in the question list that that um hasn't been 
  addressed that we need to respond to the deco.
PL/T3: Okay so I'll go back to uh presenting.
PL/T3: And go there.
PL/T3:  that's where I.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
<sharon_leu> Can you clarify - in the model with the CLRv2, where 
  it's mixed VC/Non-VC, are links only the VCs or can you link a 
  claim to a non-VC, too?
PL/T3: And I would like to.
PL/T3: Go off of sharing now and turn it over to Karen to go walk 
  through briefly uh a view of what this might look like.
PL/T3: Sure go ahead.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I I can I can take that uh and yeah go ahead 
  Karen um if you could share your screen and say a few words of 
  introduction But to answer Sharon uh you can link.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh the the general notion of hash links which 
  is what which is a link plus a cryptographic hash of the 
  destination can be applied to anything to credentials to PDFs to 
  non VC documents and so on.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Okay can you all see my screen.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh not yet.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Not yet okay great let me try.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We can hear you clear though.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Thank you uh a lot of share screen.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Are you able to see my screen now.
<sharon_leu> @Dmitri, Is that useful if it's not verifiable 
  though? In the context of this group?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh not yet I think you have to select uh the 
  window or the table that you're sharing.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Let me see window share uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And now we can hear you now we can see your 
  screen.
Karen O'Donoghue:  All right sorry I'm not familiar 1 second go 
  ahead.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay oh no problem no problem yeah so Sharon 
  uh you follow-up question uh is that useful when it's not 
  verifiable though so the.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To create a very simple very dumb credential 
  that I read this PDF right that's the that's the self assured we 
  see that I'm that I'm creating.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   And if.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I if I linked to that PDF without uh 
  cryptographic component if I just linked to it all I'm all I'm 
  putting in there is the URL somebody who's hosting that PDF could 
  change it to a completely different contents uh you know after I 
  issue this credential that that I read this thing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Add any sort of cryptographic hash to your 
  link.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You can say I read this specific version and 
  if it gets changed afterwards then the signature the uh then the 
  hash won't verify.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So that's that's all the assurance that it 
  gives it doesn't hash links don't give Assurance of authorship.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh you need additional verified credential 
  mechanisms for that so all they do is just lock down the version 
  of the object that you're referring on referring to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh over to you Karen.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Thank you thanks Dmitri so I'm going to show 
  the experience of a user who is interested in creating a 
  self-claimed credential or for a specific skill that they have 
  and I'm going to be showing the mobile version of this experience 
  although these are responsive designs that we've created so they 
  would work across any any type of device and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Karen do you wanna do you want to say a few 
  words of introduction for yourself.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Oh sure yep thanks okay so my name pardon me 
  right when you asked that of course my throat's all clogged.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Um my name is Karen Passmore I'm the CEO of 
  predictive ux and I have a background in excuse me designing 
  Enterprise applications and SAS applications and I was working 
  most recently with Arizona State University on their digital 
  wallet for um verifiable credentials which is where I met Demetri 
  and then subsequently got introduced to Phil.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Pardon my goodness.
Karen O'Donoghue:  And we've been working together on the user 
  experience of the linked claims app and our approach to this 
  project has been to look at it from an inclusive design 
  perspective to ensure that it's usable by very different types of 
  people across various intersectionalities uh and paying close 
  attention to things like internet connectivity so how can we 
  create an experience where someone might be working on uh either 
  their local machine with intermittent internet connectivity or 
  perhaps they're working in a public environment and they can't 
  save data to their local device so we've taken a lot of that into 
  consideration as we've created these designs and we've also 
  looked outward to research other people have done in this space 
  to learn what we can about people who.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Might be creating some of these uh claims and 
  our goal is to First create the experience for the user who would 
  claim a skill and then we're going to move on to the user 
  experience for getting a recommendation for a specific skill um 
  but today uh we just have kind of our first iteration or pass at 
  these Concepts and ideas and so as I show this um bear in mind 
  that you know if you want to give some feedback on anything you 
  see here today it would not hurt my feelings at all and whether 
  it's positive or negative uh so we welcome your insights it all 
  just we want to make the best app possible for uh everyone who 
  might want to use it to include you know folks that are going to 
  take this kind of Open Source platform and extended into an 
  application that they can Envision for themselves.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Uh so to get us started uh this is the kind of 
  landing page that a user would see when they come here to create 
  a self asserted skill credential.
Karen O'Donoghue:  I've put some kind of marketing material 
  content on here but of course anybody could put anything here it 
  was just to help tell the story of why you might want to create a 
  self asserted skill credential and the idea here is that this 
  user can come here sign up in seconds to capture their skills and 
  this would be a way for them to stand out from other people when 
  they can say I have a verified skill and I potentially have these 
  recommendations behind that skill to help validate it further and 
  the pitch here is that they can now tell a verifiable story and 
  we're suggesting they can capture volunteer work document their 
  on to job training or claim the number of years of experience 
  they have in their field.
Karen O'Donoghue:  They can also add their proof points request 
  recommendations.
Karen O'Donoghue:   And then.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Nice thing here is that the user keeps total 
  control of their data which I think Demetri and both Phil were 
  alluding to in their presentations and you can share only the 
  information you want and you can revoke access at any time.
Karen O'Donoghue:  So from here if someone wants to get started 
  they can click get started for free.
<dmitri_zagidulin> (this will be a free open-source web app, btw 
  -- shown here in mobile browser view)
Karen O'Donoghue:  And we welcome them and you know we have this 
  sort of friendly user interface like this person Tessa is going 
  to walk them through the experience although we're not using any 
  AI at this stage and we just asked them where they want to save 
  their linked claims and the reason is that we wanted to make sure 
  that people could get started and if they lose internet access 
  their data could be saved somewhere that they choose or they 
  could choose to save their data manually and then come back later 
  because they may not be able to finish this entire thing end to 
  end so for our demo today we're going to allow people to choose 
  Google Drive.
Karen O'Donoghue:   And then.
Karen O'Donoghue:  They want to connect to and then from here 
  once they're validated with that account they can continue to.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Their linked claim.
Karen O'Donoghue:   So the.
Karen O'Donoghue:  First thing we want to ask them is we can 
  we're going to be able to get some information from them if they 
  select something like Google Drive so we want to verify that we 
  have the right name displayed here for how they want to present 
  their uh linked claim and they could change this name if they 
  want to but if everything looks good they can click next and then 
  now we want to ask them about the skill that they want to claim 
  so they can fill in a skill name and then they can describe how 
  they earned this skill and we would provide some prompting text 
  here so I have it already filled in with an example but we're 
  mindful of the fact that some people might not know what to put 
  in to these fields so in the screen before this we actually have 
  prompting text and then on the bottom we have the duration and we 
  chose duration specifically because research has shown that when 
  actual dates are put in here it can create a sort of bias against 
  people uh because it might show gaps in between make.
Karen O'Donoghue:   Maybe their earnings.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Their employment records so using duration 
  actually decreases that sense of bias and instead focuses on the 
  level of expertise someone has inquired around a specific skill.
Karen O'Donoghue:  So from here we choose next and they can 
  describe the skill that they have and we do provide prompting 
  text here in a future State iteration of this design we're going 
  to be adding in the opportunity for people to use AI to generate 
  a description here if they want to or they can simply type in 
  their own description.
Karen O'Donoghue:  And from here they can then choose to add 
  portfolio items and this is an optional step so if they have 
  videos or photographs or um anything that they want to point to 
  online they can add those items here and this would create URLs 
  within their uh linked claim.
Karen O'Donoghue:  And they can add as many of these as they want 
  so in this example I'm just adding a video of the perfect shot of 
  espresso and I point to the URL of that video and then if I want 
  to add another I can simply tap this link and then it can add 
  more.
Karen O'Donoghue:   And from.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Here we asked.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Wait wait I want to I want to pause uh super 
  quick on on the screen here uh so this is this is the the 1 of 
  the things that Phil was emphasizing was talking about when 
  creating selfish credentials right.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's a lot of sort of unknown and a lot of 
  questions with regards to selfish or credentials in general like 
  what sort of value do they bring.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And 1 of our 1 of our answers to that is 
  twofold.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The selfish credentials are as good as 2 
  things.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This is this is what we're we're doing here.
<ildiko_mazar> Would this duration setting then result in a 
  static value, that may be disadvantageous with ongoing practiced 
  skills?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Take a video of your skill link to a 
  performance appraisal uh to an essay that you wrote to a GitHub 
  repo so this is this is that screen so this is 1 of the 2 sort of 
  main weight bearing.
<pl/t3> As we'll mention later we're also looking at the 
  Competency Explorer which is a query interface to a federated set 
  of skill repositories which one, from LinkedClaims, could issue a 
  query to and pull back the structure skill definition from one of 
  the repos in that federated network.
<nate_otto> Are you interested in the ability to link to a skills 
  library so (a) the user doesn't have to supply the skill name and 
  description themselves, and (b) it can be the same skill 
  definition already in use or available for use within job 
  descriptions?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh features of self uh selfish credentials and 
  then the other 1 of is of course recommendations uh which we'll 
  see later on that's it.
Karen O'Donoghue:   Thank you that.
Karen O'Donoghue:  That's a great call out.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Nate - very much so!
Karen O'Donoghue:  So from here after they added their evidence 
  we asked them if they want to add a main image to their 
  credential so this is really just about you know design and 
  formatting and making it present nicely if they want to add an 
  image here and the idea is they could point to really any image 
  that they have or you know they could even go out to something 
  like unsplash and you know grab a an image from their.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Ildiko - GREAT question (with regards to 
  duration vs ongoing skills!)
<pl/t3> @Nate - note my call out to the C3 federated repository 
  project.
Karen O'Donoghue:  And then if they select next they can see the 
  credential that they've created so we have our main image that 
  has been added here um the person's name has claimed basic 
  Barista training uh how many days it took and then the it has 
  their description and then how they earned the skill and a link 
  to any portfolio items and then beneath that we make sure that 
  they're aware that by selecting this box you understand that you 
  are creating a public link to this credential so they know that 
  this is this is now a publicly available link and they can choose 
  not to do that if they want to and at any point during the 
  creation of this credential they can save and exit or they can 
  you know go back to another step and make some edits if they're 
  not happy with the way that this looks but if they are happy with 
  everything they can select finish and sign and it saves it to 
  their Google Drive and so now they've uh saved their achievement 
  and we're exploring whether or not we're going to promote sharing 
  this on social media um so that's that's a conversation that 
  we're having but if we don't the minimum they would see.
Karen O'Donoghue:   Some visual represent.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Within this app of the credential that they've 
  created.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Um when they select this they can copy the 
  link to that credential.
Karen O'Donoghue:   And then.
Karen O'Donoghue:  And then as a next step we want to encourage 
  them to go get a verified reference so get a recommendation today 
  and if they select that button it takes them into a flow where 
  we've just provided them with some copy that they can um actually 
  literally copy we've given them some text along with a link to um 
  send someone to a place where they can write up the 
  recommendation which would take them the.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Recipient back to the linked claims 
  application to write a recommendation that could get then 
  attached to the original credential so the user can choose to 
  copy this text and then paste it into their uh Native email 
  client and so they would copy this text and then um when they're 
  done we would just say oh you've requested a reference now we're 
  not able to track this at this point um.
Karen O'Donoghue:  I can let.
Karen O'Donoghue:  To me to speak to that so that's the entire 
  flow that we have so far.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thank you so much Karen so we had a couple of 
  uh really good questions in the chat so ilao brought up a great 
  point about ongoing durations right so what to do when like it's 
  1 thing if I took a 5-day intensive course in I don't know 
  espresso making and it's another thing when it's I've been 
  practicing this uh since uh 2023 ongoing up till now right and 
  and it's important so 1 that that's a that's a great design 
  consideration for everyone dealing with these skills uh the main 
  thing is that um main thing to note is that that duration skill 
  is free form text right so I can say 2023 till now right I I can 
  indicate or rather I have as much flexibility to indicate that it 
  is an ongoing skill as I do in like a Word document resume.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh so that's that thought number 1 uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then the second question uh was from Nate 
  Auto on whether we're interested in uh sort of integrating with 
  or linking to uh skills repositories since that's 1 of the major.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I I don't want to say unsolved but that's the 
  heavier uiux lift.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Of how do we.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  How do we walk in the fine line between making 
  it user-friendly.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Right so like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  On on the user-friendly access free form text 
  like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  How to pour an espresso right like that's 
  that's 1 definition of a scale and then on the other end of the 
  formal spectrum is uh linking into a um Federal.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Skill code repository and and say okay this is 
  skill 1 2 3.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  As codified by this and this directory right 
  so yeah we're definitely interested in um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Linking to an integrating with any sort of 
  existing skill repositories.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Uh yeah.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah please please yeah mhm.
PL/T3: I can jump in here and say that um we actually have or or 
  ranging a call because as you probably know the um C3 community 
  at T at T3 uh has been working for a while now on a Federated 
  skill uh repository network uh with a qu with a user interface 
  query environment uh system called uh competency Explorer is that 
  if I've got that right and um and the question that we're 
  exploring and just and and going to have an a conversation with 
  the developers of that.
<nate_otto> That means referencing skills by URLs (not just names 
  and descriptions that are not as suitable for matching). Skills 
  libraries include https://lightcast.io/open-skills and 
  https://www.wgu.edu/lp/general/wgu/skills-library.html and 
  https://www.openrsd.com/ -- the main benefit being that the same 
  skill definition can be used in multiple places.
<ildiko_mazar> :+1: Thanks, @Phil.
PL/T3: Can we put in a link or uh uh to that particular Federated 
  search uh system from within this app and or provide a UI that 
  can be translated into a query for that particular Network and 
  that we hope will be something that we will be um pursuing 
  actively because you're absolutely right there is a number of 
  different places where we would like the individual to have an 
  option to put in a structured representation that follows some 
  ontology or taxonomy of of skill descriptions that might also be 
  available to people who are issuing credentials from an 
  institution or what have you um to draw from so we definitely 
  interested in doing that and have a conversation scheduled 
  thanks.
PL/T3: Okay um at this point.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 SEC 1 SEC um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   I I just.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Want to address uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Karen's comment about being able to track I 
  hold on I'm just reading uh Nate's.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Comment in chat referencing skill by URL.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Excellent yeah thank uh thanks Nate we'll 
  we'll definitely take a look at uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Those links.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And as as always we'd love to work with you on 
  uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   On any of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That uh real quick uh Karen's um comment about 
  that we're not uh tracking the whether or not.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> that can also be done by 
  linking to individual competencies in CTDL, using the CTID as a 
  unique reference
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Person received and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh responded to the recommendation request so 
  1 of the 1 of the main design choices that uh we we followed 
  closely here is that this is purely.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Compliance side application meaning we don't 
  run a server or a database on the back end so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You don't create an account we don't store the 
  credentials for you we don't track the recommendation requests 
  and the responses right so this is maximally privacy preserving 
  meaning when you hit request a recommendation it opens up it's a 
  male tool link it opens up your email client so that you can 
  email your professor or your your friend or whatever whoever 
  you're asking for the recommendation right and similarly uh since 
  we don't access your email inbox we don't know when they reply 
  etc etc now we have a minimal amount of um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Not tracking of um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Statistics but as much as possible this is uh 
  this is meant to be privacy preserving Karen did you have any uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Any other comments uh UI.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Well I think that we're prioritizing as you 
  said the.
<pl/t3> @Deb - absolutely, and we're very interested in the 
  repositories that are there like CE's. We're just getting to the 
  point in the design where this on the near horizon ;-)
Karen O'Donoghue:  Ability for uh users to come here and create 
  something and and own and protect their data as much as possible 
  and I think along the lines you know it's a fine line right about 
  how how far we go with that and then where these are experienced 
  may get uh create might create friction right but we're not 
  trying to solve I think it's fair to say we're not trying to 
  solve every problem right now our goal is to get something out 
  there that people can use to create uh a linked claim and then 
  get their recommendations and as we go through this process I 
  think we'll learn a lot especially as we get you know kind of do 
  an initial release or somebody picks up the code and Builds an 
  application with it that will help inform further iterations of 
  the application.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks over to you Phil.
PL/T3: Yep okay so um if you can release your screen there so I 
  can jump back in there we go.
PL/T3: Now head back to link claims I actually think this is the 
  point where we jump um.
PL/T3: Not sick uh into um what the an idea of how the Json LD 
  for doing hash links works and I'll bring this up briefly and let 
  turn it to Demetri to go through it sorry there it is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh sure yeah uh so.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> @PL let us know whatever we 
  can do to help!
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh yeah this just these couple of slides just 
  illustrate the mechanism of uh what 1 of the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Like right so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It is it is a pairing of a URL and a 
  cryptographic hash as as I mentioned to Sharon earlier to lock 
  down the particular version of an object.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh to to make it um tamper evident.
PL/T3: Okay and this is an example of the same idea of in this 
  case linking out to a random digital object in this case a 
  journal a journal article that might be in the person's uh.
PL/T3: Might be in a location that they have access to or their 
  own personal repository of of Journal publications of their of 
  their work so this might be the kind of thing that a recommender 
  would do to give Credence to their ability to judge whatever this 
  particular credential is about in this case it's about being able 
  to to Pilot a UAV um and so they've written a paper on it and so 
  this is a hashling to that paper.
PL/T3: So moving right along so what's new here um.
PL/T3: This is essentially um.
PL/T3: Uh nothing terribly new in 1 cents we're taking advantage 
  of the VC data model and the cryptographic of binding approaches 
  including hash links which have been around for a while but not 
  particularly well used.
PL/T3: Um there are they do exist in true age credential they do 
  exist in the true pick c2p implementations um which bind in their 
  particular case and this uh images to the camera uh that uh that 
  captured it um and generate a credential as a consequence.
PL/T3: What is new is the introduction of hash links for the 
  purposes of this kind of social recommendation and uh evidence uh 
  pointers.
PL/T3: Some in summary then we'll just say that link claims is an 
  on-ramp for incorporating unsigned data into complex proofs 
  claims.
PL/T3: Uses this hash link mechanism as a Mech as a format for 
  doing so.
PL/T3: Tries to mirror the patterns of social recommendations and 
  the like that uh that exists uh today that we've had for a long 
  time.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> for anyone who hasn't seen 
  competencies in CTDL, this is an example of a DOL industry 
  framework competency in CTDL 
  https://credentialfinder.org/competency/ce-6aa26646-a955-4ccd-927d-468ac21f5df8
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> similar data available from 
  ESCO
PL/T3: The other thing I would say is that um it is specifically 
  oriented towards those organiz those individuals that otherwise 
  wouldn't be getting issued credentials from an educational 
  institution training organization Etc and and and gives them a 
  way to create credentials through an interface that they can then 
  store into a digital wallet into a Google Drive uh etc for them 
  to be able to participate in this ecosystem equally with with 
  others.
PL/T3: With that said there's a couple pieces of future work 
  we're very interested in and we're doing some staging in the this 
  link claims project 1 of which um is associated with connecting a 
  mobile wallet to a wallet attached storage so that an individual 
  has uh the opportunity to to manage and control the credentials 
  that they have over a lifetime and not just continually have the 
  only location for their storage being their mobile device.
PL/T3: Functionalities that by doing that are enabled um 1 might 
  be envisioned in this context author authorization on 
  authentication to credentials in that storage that is available 
  24 by 7 um and allows access to specific things uh specific 
  individuals or endpoints to look at and things of that sort.
PL/T3: The second uh piece um is associated with another new type 
  of credential which we're calling the narrative credential.
PL/T3:  and in.
PL/T3: Ways this is just um.
PL/T3: Represent representing the storytelling part that is 
  missing in resume in RSS and and VCS to you as represented by VCS 
  to date and that is literally to tell a story as you would type a 
  story with links in that particular text to the credentials that 
  back up the claims that your story is making and so the simplest 
  way to think about this is kind of a manifest to a a container 
  where all of the different objects in the container are listed as 
  links that can be followed to see what the credential is for that 
  particular object in the container that's in the sort of generic 
  sense in this case it allows you to tell a story.
PL/T3: Think makes the collection of your skills relevant and 
  meaningful to the relying party in terms of consideration for 
  that opportunity.
PL/T3: And do so by backing it up with data.
PL/T3: And uh and so very excited about the possibility of doing 
  that next and lastly the piece that we have sort of danced around 
  um is the idea that the person writing this self issued 
  credential doesn't have the uh aspect of um a an institution or 
  an organization behind an issued credential to give it some 
  degree of credence and and and um and sense of value from a human 
  perspective.
PL/T3: Credential issued by XYZ institution is a differently 
  treated than perhaps a credential issued by Phil Long about 
  myself.
PL/T3: So the question is what do we do and how do we make sure 
  that it will very least that the credential that I'm issuing 
  about me is actually from me.
PL/T3: And the first step in that is to make a a process that 
  allows you to validate that and do the kyc which issuing 
  institutions do by default when someone applies um to be a 
  student there or in an employment context when someone applies to 
  be a an employee at a censure or some place like that those 
  individuals go through a kyc process and know your customer if 
  you will process to make sure that they are who they say they 
  are.
PL/T3: In our case the idea for doing that here is with a 
  notoriousedc.
PL/T3:  and liter.
PL/T3: Leveraging motorization services that exist and which 
  almost every state in the US at least now permits in terms of a 
  remote notary service to allow the individuals identifier in this 
  case there did to be connected to a person and the notary is a 
  new credential subject uh type.
PL/T3:  that is.
PL/T3: Bound 2 with link claims to the individuals credentials 
  that is making their claim.
PL/T3:  so that.
PL/T3: The context of the notary as a future piece of work.
PL/T3: Lastly there are lots of other places that this idea can 
  can be applied to uh it can be applied to for example uh keeping 
  track of the papers you should submit if you're an academic or 
  you're writing you're a business person you want to have a 
  repository of the things you published it can be used to do 
  reputation reviews it can be used to as you saw in my reference 
  to the c2p project it can be used to um put a credential around 
  the origin of an image and the bonus the the data around its 
  capture to try to um deal with uh the proliferation of of image 
  manipulation that's out there it can be used to track Disaster 
  Recovery funds to see whether or not they actually got 
  distributed to the individuals that claim uh that they were 
  claimed to be sent uh to to help them and others.
PL/T3: So that's linked claims.
PL/T3: And I'll stop there and we'll open it to any questions 
  that people might have.
<ildiko_mazar> Could you share the slides, please?
PL/T3: Have good question and title timely because uh I believe 
  we have in fact been able to secure a small amount of funding for 
  doing some usability research Karen would you give a brief uh 
  summary of what your intentions are here just to do this.
Simone Ravaoli: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b4iyZi2b2fZ-m65nJR36MUlha419LI898GsjHHZTfVc/edit?usp=sharing
<ildiko_mazar> Thank you, Simone.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Yes absolutely that I appreciate the question 
  as well it's super important to me to do the not only usability 
  research but also understand the people who would be creating 
  this data and then the consumers of the data for right now what 
  we're going to be focused on is.
<pl/t3> @Ildiko - yes -Simone beat me to it!
Karen O'Donoghue:  Potential users of that application from the 
  perspective of creating a linked claim and we're going to take 
  the application that you just saw today and then approached 
  anyone that we are able to recruit um for the amount of time that 
  we have available we're looking at doing maybe a 6 week usability 
  study have them walk through the application with us uh through 
  some various scenarios and get their feedback on the 
  accessibility usability um intuitiveness of the application so 
  just making sure that we're actually creating something that 
  people can use another part of that that we'd love to embark on 
  is doing some deeper research and understanding when people might 
  want to create a linked claim and then how they want to use it 
  right so we're showing kind of a very limited subset of the 
  possible use cases that fill displayed on 1 of the last slides 
  there and we would love an opportunity to go deeper into that 
  research and also understand um things from different 
  perspectives so we have you know traditional Learners and 
  non-traditional Learners and people who are maybe going to be 
  creating.
Karen O'Donoghue:   A linked claim who might.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Currently be employed for.
Karen O'Donoghue:  To somebody who isn't employed and just coming 
  at it from um understanding those various perspectives would is 
  important to us as well as looking at it from the notary 
  perspective so when somebody is going to provide a recommendation 
  to someone it's important to us to understand you know what they 
  go through this process what kind of blockers might prevent them 
  from making a recommendation because we we know some upfront 
  friction is necessary to create a verified experience here or 
  verified link claim but we don't want to go too far right so then 
  beyond that we're also interested in understanding how companies 
  might consume a linked claim because we understand that you know 
  right now we're at the early stages of Designing this and we've 
  had internal conversations about things like uh Phil mentioned 
  earlier like taxonomies and ontologies and other systems that we 
  could connect to but we also understand that it's important for 
  us to look at the companies that might be consuming length claims 
  and what systems um.
Karen O'Donoghue:   They're using and how.
Karen O'Donoghue:  So there's just so much research here that 
  we're excited about doing but we're we're definitely at the early 
  early stages so it's focused on the usability of the current APP 
  you saw today.
PL/T3: Last comment on that um we have we didn't describe it here 
  but we do have an interest in being able to present a view of 
  credentials to an individual who does not have a credential 
  wallet that is to selling party that does not have a credential 
  wallet but could be viewing them uh via their browser and 
  verifying them via their browser that does not mean that the 
  credential is sent to them it just means that they are given a 
  link to where a credential is temporarily stored to do that.
PL/T3:  and then the.
<ildiko_mazar> Have you considered a use case for prior learning 
  recognition?
PL/T3: Sometimes if they wish to receive the actual data to put 
  into their systems um how would we do that because of the 
  challenges associated with establishing the current mechanisms 
  and protocol exchange for credentials that small businesses are 
  unlikely to be able to support and maintain themselves and we 
  have some ideas about going about that process uh lastly I say 
  the T3 has been generous and the funding is allowing us to put 
  this application up when it's complete for probably at least a 3 
  to 6 month period for anybody to use and allow us to collect data 
  potentially on its usage and allow others to try it out and find 
  areas that we can improve or that they can improve because it 
  will be open source.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah to add a couple uh just a few more words 
  to that uh as as as Phil mentioned uh it's going to be an open 
  source app right it is it is already uh and it'll be that much 
  more useful uh when it's finished so you you'll be able to take a 
  look at it hosts your own.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In term will.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Will publish the uh credential schemas of of 
  the credentials that were that were creating both the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh recommendation ones and the lightweight uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Skill credential so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And and we were definitely uh there's lots of 
  exciting usability research especially as both Phil and Karen 
  mentioned in the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The receiving relying party end right if all 
  this is successful and I get a self self asserted credential uh 
  with recommendations with evidence all this good stuff.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And I sent it to my employer how will the 
  employer consume it how will they display it how will they be 
  able to verify it not having verify your software of their own 
  and how do they uh work it into their uh existing workflow all of 
  those things uh we're looking at so please uh please come talk to 
  us to Convention have we considered a use case for prior learning 
  recognition um so it's a 2 things 1 is I I think other projects 
  are focusing on that a bit more right so the traditional uh 
  learning recognition.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Credentials but uh the the other answer is 
  the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Self asserted uh learning and skill 
  credentials that that we're doing in the app right now are 
  flexible enough to recognize those as well uh but we'd love to 
  talk to you more about it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To see what you have in mind.
<pl/t3> ACE has a prior recognition for credit initiative. LC's 
  could be adapted for that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Any other question.
PL/T3: Over to you Demetri.
PL/T3: Oh excuse me over to you Simone.
<ildiko_mazar> :+1: Thanks @Dmitri.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah uh any anyone else Simone okay yeah.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> see ACE credit recommendations 
  in CTDL
