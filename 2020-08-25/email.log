Kim Hamilton Duffy:

Topipc: Progress on Action Items
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  First one is a proposed work item now 
  accepted
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec
  ... Orie proposed it, then no activity, then a flurry of 
  activity. Now work can get started - universal wallet interop 
  spec
  ... link posted in irc
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/123
Kim Hamilton Duffy: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/
  ...Next work item - Issue 123 audio logs broken
  ... there are meeting notes where audio isn't present, the 
  problem is fixed going forward
  ...there are roughly 6 mo where audio is missing - we call for 
  volunteers to backfill this information
  ... if you want to get involved and contribute, this is a great 
  opportunity
Heather Vescent:  We were thinking this is a great project for 
  anyone wanting to get more involved
  ...I will take a lead, and want 2-3 volunteers to go through a 
  straightforward process to grab the data from DB servers and 
  upload it
  ... if anyone is interested, look for the email to the CCG list
  ... needs at least 1 volunteer

Topic: Cermaic Protocol Discussion

Gregory Rocco: Hah - quick note - it's just Mike not myself re: 
  presenting.
Michael Sena:  Thank you. Generally the structure is - introduce 
  ceramic, go into details about specific ways it is being 
  considered for use
  ... link to a google slide presentation in irc
  ... ceramic is a data web for open applications, not exactly 
  like a database, but you can think of it like global database
  ...can be used for storing any data based document
  ... treebox is a user managed datastore that let to ceramic
  ...wanted a public network for managing data
  ...any data that requires verifiabilty and cross collaboration
Kayode Ezike: Could someone repost the link to the presentation 
  please? I think I joined after it was shared.
  ... smart docs considered one of the most powerful ways to 
  manage data on the web
  ...meant for data that is owned by DIDs and ?
  ... can use docs to define metadata
  ... information integrity is built in
  ...can form relationships between documents
  ... the notion of programability is highlighted
  ... you can program content in the same way others program 
  money and assets
  ... records are signed by DIDs and stored on the blockchain
  ...slide 5 - other benefits are global discoverability
  ... you can traverse the graph for related content
  ... auditability, imposability, create links between docs,
  ... composability of content is important, any DID can be used
  ... a network that does not provide lock in
  ... DIDs can be controlled with crypto keys means data isn't 
  trapped, horizontal scaleablity
  ... technology - DIDs, IPLD, web p-to-p, blockchain
  ... content can be backed up to any storage system
  ... protocol makes no requirements as to back up system
  ... network itself is one global network, but no global state
  ... each doc is handled individually
  ... ceramic can scale to meet the needs of global conten
  ... "content"
  ... nodes can pin or watch a set of docs they care about
  ... documents slide - gives an overview of the lifecycle of a 
  document
  ... each doc has a docid, owned by DID
  ... you can include uniqueness or randomness to avoid clashes 
  in creating genesis record
  ... once it is anchored, proof of blockchain record, then it is 
  attached to the doc
  ... updates can happen with one commit
  ... you can have anchoring services
  ...you have scalability in these different ways
  ... doc types are more of less just programs that govern state 
  mutations of docs
  ... requires certain content format
  ... you can use ceramic to manage verifiable claims
  ... every update is manage automatically
  ... there's no extra checks needed
  ... can run directly in browser or on a server in the cloud
  ... creation of an identity index is highlighted
  ... like a hub but without relying on a server
  ... next slide overview of idx
  ... you can have an index doc where keys are other ceramic docs
  ... this structure provides a way for DIDs to provide mappings
  ... users want a way to link many different accounts, and would 
  like to manage encrypted data vaults, but don't want to rely only 
  on servers
  ... users for different use cases might want an optional layer 
  with ceramic
  ... you can create lists of users documents, to register DIDs
Daniel Buchner: Are we conflating 'server' with 'piece of code 
  that must run at a provider' - if so, I just want to note that 
  nothing about EDV or Identity Hubs requires the latter
Daniel Buchner: Not seeing how they would get the 
  stream/throughput characteristics that you might want for many 
  app use cases if all you could do is have your phone host your 
  app backends
  ... ceramic is live and available to check out, resources are 
  there, code is on github
Daniel Buchner: Unless Verizon is cool with you basically eating 
  100s of TBs per month, along with basically melting your phone
  ... github and discord have details
  ... dlongley: thank you for presenting ceramic
  ... this could fill a significant gap in the ecosystem
Daniel Buchner: If course, we welcome work on Identity Hubs, if 
  any of this is applicable to ingest as informative inputs

Topic: Secure Data Store

Daniel Buchner:  Can you precisely contract how you see servers 
  (using that term loosely), depending on use cases, it might take 
  quite a bit to run that on your phone, how does that work?
Michael Sena:  Depends on the use case
  ... some information could run on mobile device, other 
  information you would not want to, and keep that on another 
  server system
  ... you can use both
Daniel Buchner: The response seems to pose these as two different 
  things, why is that?
  ... provide a trusted open avail infrastructure for mappings 
  and routings
Mediated/shared endpoints that point to EDV/Hub endpoints
Wayne Chang:  Asking more about hubs, and can we look at use 
  cases?
Daniel Buchner:  Targeting use cases that half the apps on 
  internet are fully public
  ... first hit on piece of data are phone, and have side effects 
  like battery life, etc
Wayne Chang:  What are jobs to be done by the hub?
Daniel Buchner:  Specific to whatever the data is, like google 
  keep or spotify
  ... and, routes and relays messages
Wayne Chang:  What's the relationship between hubs and ceramic
Dave Longley: I think ceramic allows discovery of hubs (and hubs 
  use EDVs internally)
Daniel Buchner:  A shared effort to bring them together would be 
  great
Adrian Gropper:  Would like to continue this discussion, mapping 
  the world into policy decision points
Dave Longley:  Why would you not discover your Hub instance 
  endpoints via your DID Document? [scribe assist by Daniel 
  Buchner]
Daniel Buchner: As a service endpoint
  ... curious if both  daniel and michael would respond to how 
  one would map a policy decision point model
Daniel Buchner:  Policy is set by you
Wayne Chang: https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Policy%20Decision%20Point 
  <- context for those not familiar with PDPs/PEPs
Adrian Gropper:  Stipulating separating the data storage point v 
  policy decision point
Daniel Buchner:  For all the reasons discussed in the DID WG -- 
  GDPR concerns with VDRs and so on ... and that you might want to 
  include *additional* information about the DID before anyone 
  wants to ever hit that service endpoint (like, include a VC from 
  a commonly trusted source, for example) [scribe assist by Dave 
  Longley]
Daniel Buchner:  Multiple modalities, if you don't have a series 
  of musts at every layer, the issue that could happen is everyone 
  configures their hub differently, and then interoperability 
  breaks down
Adrian Gropper:  How does ceramic deal with this
Michael Sena:  Ceramic allows use of textile threads, and ?
  ... you can use DID managed docs to give you access to a server 
  in various ways
  ... users have another layer of control
Adrian Gropper:  Is it decentralized across the web itself?
Michael Sena:  Yes, exactly
Heather Vescent: A++ econnell!
Dave Longley: +1 Thank you econnell!
Wayne Chang: Yes, thank you econnell
Wayne Chang: Excellent stuff
