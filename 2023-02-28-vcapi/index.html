<div onmouseout="$('#link-2').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-2').show()" id="2" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  On the agenda today go ahead and screen share on the agenda today John I believe you wanted to chat a bit about presenting VC API at the open Wallet foundation so we should definitely pick that up and then the rest of the time we had set aside for talking about fee Capi exchanges in kind of discussing what that looks like. <a id="link-2" style="display:none;" href="#2">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  All right relevant Community updates let me Community let me bring up. <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Theory there so the verifiable credentials working group the 20 specification is entering feature freeze we will be at feature freeze by the end of March that&apos;s the cutoff date so the theory here is that after that date we will only be dealing with issues that are in the current issue tracker their eighty three of those we will only be working on specifications that will have been adopted by that point in we will start ratcheting down. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   On the group and getting ready to go into candidate recommendation. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Which is when we actually start implementing the specification around the summer so again those dates are feature freeze for everything in the verifiable credentials to a working group by end of March so we have month and then Canada Trek which is we tell the implementers to start implementing the spec is stable around the summer at some point probably towards the end of the summer. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  To go ahead Patrick. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): How&apos;s this going to work out like once V2 is out is it going to supersede V1 or they both going to live side by side meaning implementers could choose to issue V1 credential or is it going to be strongly recommended to migrate towards V2 or is the one going to be deprecated eventually. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That&apos;s a great question I don&apos;t know the answer to that question typically typically v11 lives out there because you&apos;re already seeing the 11 be put into like legislation right and sometimes that gets like the European Union architecture reference you know thing has talks about P11 they will probably update it to V2 but that&apos;s not guaranteed so usually the signaling is those of you that are using the 11 you can keep using it it&apos;s totally fine. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Fine you know. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  You can continue deploying on that and if you like V2 better you can use V2 and then of course the implementers are almost certainly going to be expected to support both V1 and V2 the good news there is that they&apos;re not horrible breaking changes between the two and so it&apos;s a fairly light lifts to support the one with Envy to at this point in time. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  But you know. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  As with the working groups going to do they might decide to do something totally different right I think it would be good for the whole ecosystem for us to basically strongly urge people to move over to be too it&apos;s better right but you know how that works you can&apos;t get 100% of the ecosystem to move versions if people have already deployed stuff. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Okay so in order to be ready for candidate recommendation typically a working group it&apos;s a good idea usually it used to be like you&apos;d go into candidate recommendation and then you&apos;d like figure out what the test Suite is going to do but it&apos;s usually a good idea to have a test Suite well before you go into candidate recommendation so that in you have implementers so that you know you&apos;re going to survive candidate recommendation because if you have to remove a feature or change a feature during candidate recommendation you have to effectively. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Give everyone enough. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Effectively a minimum of a couple of weeks to do the rev in usually candidate recommendation you know it&apos;s like you&apos;re in there for like a minimum of three months run until at least every single feature that the working group wanted implementers to implement is is done so it&apos;s a huge pain to have to you know figure out the test Suite while you&apos;re you know in the pressure cooker of candidate recommendation so we try to get. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   The test Suite done. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Um today we just proposed a test suite for verifiable credentials to 0 at the ccg because the process was was like we incubate stuff in the ccg we make sure that you know it&apos;s got buy-in and then once it gets by and then the verifiable credential working group decides whether or not they want to take on the work so earlier today I propose like hey here&apos;s a test Suite it&apos;s powered by the VC API because we already have. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   13 Implementers. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Able to demonstrate interoperability before jmf plugfest 3 and then the chairs were like no don&apos;t do this here just bring it straight to the verifiable credential working group so this is I think the chairs wanting us to just not do the incubation and ccg and just put it into the verifiable credentials working group directly so I think that&apos;s fine. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   They&apos;re so. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That&apos;s that&apos;s happening the other thing is you know or we felt like it&apos;s not appropriate for the verifiable credentials working group to use the verifiable credentials API to do testing on the specification. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don&apos;t really understand where that&apos;s coming from but there it is and I think my Pro Rock one of the chairs is saying he would rather instead of using the VC API use Postman a human based tests which is what they&apos;ve been using for the traceability or extreme so with that said Greg maybe you could add the add the color that you added at the beginning of the call. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Greg Bernstein</span>:  Part of wood what I mean that is coming up with the test but then you need an interface to the test and VC API is the simplest interface available and we&apos;re not talking about the entire set of e c API we&apos;re talking about just some fundamental ways getting the VC&apos;s in so we can. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Greg Bernstein</span>:   Test them because I&apos;m working on. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Greg Bernstein</span>:  Test vectors for some of the signing stuff and yeah I&apos;m going to be running you know test Suites. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Greg Bernstein</span>:  But how you get the day to end the test of a true you know and that&apos;s what&apos;s seems so good about using the VC API I do not know if they were thinking that I&apos;m talking about the whole VC API or not so that was just my impression my my two cents worth. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Thanks thanks Greg thank you very very helpful go ahead Dave and then. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yeah I don&apos;t think anyone needs to get the impression that the anyone would be required to implement to this test Suite to be able to prove conformance this is just a test Suite that is one mechanism by which people can demonstrate that they&apos;re implementing the data model and whatever to whatever extent we need to make that more clear that would be great this doesn&apos;t preclude anyone else from developing their own test Suites and encouraging people to implement against those but this. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:   This is. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I&apos;ve already done that we could use to leverage and provide some signals that some people have actually implemented the 20 demo. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Thanks Dave Patrick. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): Yeah just to follow the same Trend like if we look at the VC test with the first one you know there was the concept of a command line generator and so on and it was not so obvious how it could be run I think the way I read this is you&apos;re going to abstract this generator concept with the VC API which going to sort of act as your generator meaning it&apos;s just going to take an input and return a verifiable credential and I think that only. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): Two routes the credentials issue and probably presentations prove which are very I don&apos;t know even the way I see it pretty simple and points and shouldn&apos;t be too complicated to implement so yeah I think it makes sense the second sort of parallel wanted to make so the air is Agent this or any as we have What&apos;s called the back Channel which is like a common API definition for different Frameworks to be able to be. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab):  called by the test the test Suite. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): This sort of parallel and it&apos;s a system that kind of makes sense and you can do modular test on this defined API and then people can decide which route they want to include and which tests they want to run so I think it&apos;s good my one of my question was I was looking that in the document is said to include your implementation and the VC test Suite alimentation so this test suite for VC point to is good is it going to become like another of the test suite for the VC API. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab):  hi or it&apos;s going to be sort of this own thing that can leverage their beasts API. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The second thing he said is the intent. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): Right so it&apos;s going to be its own thing but can leverage specific endpoints of the VC API to yeah for me I think that makes it. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Okay thanks Joe Europe. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  And you might be double muted. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="comment"><span class="name">Joe Andrieu</span>:  Yep extra Hardware button can you hear me now so unfortunately I wasn&apos;t able to make the ccg call today they actually can&apos;t send it over to the VC WG and they actually also can&apos;t stop the work so I think one question is do we feel that this work will survive over 2v C WG in a better way than currently as its incubated. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yes hmm it&apos;s a good question. <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="comment"><span class="name">Joe Andrieu</span>:  He&apos;ll push back just like where you say hey don&apos;t do the test Suite with the VC API so I&apos;m not sure the VC w g is a. <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-53').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-53').show()" id="53" class="comment"><span class="name">Joe Andrieu</span>:  Really going to accept the work. <a id="link-53" style="display:none;" href="#53">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-54').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-54').show()" id="54" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So let&apos;s play out that scenario might look like because we have a process here right so typically we bring it in front of the ccg the ccg chairs in the VC w g chair said they&apos;d get together and figure out what to do there was a clear instruction from the VC WG chair that we should just bring it directly to the VC working group if for whatever reason it is rejected there and I think that. <a id="link-54" style="display:none;" href="#54">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-55').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-55').show()" id="55" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   There&apos;s a sensitivity here that some in that group. <a id="link-55" style="display:none;" href="#55">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-56').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-56').show()" id="56" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  At this would be the V CW G blessing the VC API as a valid way to do something and that it that that that could send the wrong signals in the market for the people that want like oid see to be the one you know protocol to movie seas around in I would imagine that that is probably the reason people might - one that because the all other are the. <a id="link-56" style="display:none;" href="#56">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-57').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-57').show()" id="57" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Reasons don&apos;t make a whole ton of sense as. <a id="link-57" style="display:none;" href="#57">✪</a></div>
