Harrison_Tang: Good morning everyone uh welcome to this week's W3 
  cccg meeting today we're excited to have annual John Daniel John 
  uh to talk about the DHS Department of Homeland Security's 
  technical implementation requirements for decentralized identity.
Harrison_Tang: But before we get to the main agenda just want to 
  quickly go through some administrative items.
Harrison_Tang: First of all just a quick reminder about the 
  Callback the exam professional conduct just want to make sure 
  that we have respectful and constructive conversations.
Harrison_Tang: A second uh a quick note on the intellectual 
  property uh anyone can participate in these calls har Harvard or 
  substantive contributions to any ccg work items must be the 
  member of the ccg with 4 IP agreements signed so if you don't 
  have a w3c account or have questions about that uh please reach 
  out to any of the cultures.
Harrison_Tang: Uh these calls are automatically uh recorded and 
  transcribed uh we will publish the transcription the audio 
  recording and the video recording uh in the next few days.
Harrison_Tang: And we use GT chat to cue the speakers during the 
  call so you can type in Q Plus to add yourself to the queue or 
  cue minus to remove.
Harrison_Tang: Just wanted to take a quick moment for the 
  introductions and reintroduction so if you're new to the 
  community well you haven't been active and want to re-engage just 
  feel free to unmute and introduce yourself.
Arjen_van_Veen_(SpruceID): I'll go first hey all uh I'm Aryan I 
  work with Spruce ID and uh yeah Keen to learn more about the svap 
  stuff and.
Arjen_van_Veen_(SpruceID): To engage with you.
Sam Smith:  Hi my name is Wes I'm a software engineer at digital 
  Bazaar and looking forward to working with you all.
Harrison_Tang: Welcome welcome Wes.
Harrison_Tang: A lot of familiar faces and also new ones so don't 
  be shy.
Harrison_Tang: All right uh.
Harrison_Tang: Announcement or reminders so if you have uh some.
Harrison_Tang: On you please.
<manu_sporny> Verifiable Credentials Overview: 
  https://w3c.github.io/vc-overview/
<manu_sporny> BitString Status List is now a Candidate 
  Recommendation: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/
Manu Sporny:  Uh hey everyone um thanks Harrison uh a couple of 
  uh document Publications that folks should be aware of um we had 
  3 documents moved forward on the standards track uh last week and 
  the week before the first 1 is the verifiable I'm gonna verify 
  I'm gonna put it in chat verifiable credentials overview so 
  there's now a verifiable credentials overview document which is 
  an introduction to all of the specifications uh in the w3c 
  verifiable credential space um it's a good it's meant to be an 
  entry point and give people kind of a lay of the land on all the 
  different specifications uh that we're moving forward um so that 
  is now a work item in the verifiable credential working group uh 
  the next uh announcement is uh bitstring status list is now a 
  candidate recommendation so this.
Manu Sporny:   Basically means.
<manu_sporny> Controller Document 
  https://www.w3.org/TR/controller-document/
Manu Sporny:  Feature Frozen with bitstring status list uh it is 
  published we are looking for implementers at this point of which 
  they're already enough implementers um we're doing test Suite 
  stuff like that but that's another big um kind of move forward 
  and then finally there is a new document called the controller 
  document uh sorry a new specification called controller document 
  a decentralized identifiers document is a type of controller 
  document and now there's a generalized specification for that 
  that the VC is publishing um that is meant to go on to the the 
  global standards track as well so lots of.
Manu Sporny:  Um just making sure this group is aware of those uh 
  pieces of progress that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you man.
Harrison_Tang: Any other announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: So uh next week uh we'll have uh Greg to talk 
  about updates to DBS for VC uh and Json LD and the week after 
  that we'll have um.
Harrison_Tang: Korean uh to talk about their why ID campaign so 
  that's a uh not a technical talk uh it's talking about more on 
  the social impact side of things.
Harrison_Tang: So a lot of interesting topics coming up.
Harrison_Tang: All right any updates to the work items.
Harrison_Tang: Last calls for introductions reintroductions 
  announcements or work item updates.
Harrison_Tang: So I know will uh our culture has been reached out 
  to different folks in regards to updates on the work items so 
  we'll have more to report later.
Harrison_Tang: All right so uh let's get to the main agenda again 
  uh very excited to have a Neil here uh Neil already has sent out 
  the presentation in advance to the public list so you can just 
  open it up and then follow along.
Harrison_Tang:  all right.
Anil John:  Uh thank you Harrison I'm going to share and hope 
  that things work as expected give me just 1 second.
<manu_sporny> Link to public slide deck: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2024May/att-0075/DHS.Technical.Implementation.Requirements-Decentralized-Identity-v1.0-SHARE.pdf
Anil John:  Hopefully you are seeing my screen.
Harrison_Tang: Yes looks good.
Anil John:  Perfect all right first of all thank you all very 
  much uh for the opportunity to uh share details about our 
  technical uh implementation requirements um uh good morning good 
  evening uh good night whatever time zone that you're in um as 
  Harrison mentioned my name is Anil John um I'm a technical 
  director with the US Department of Homeland Security and uh the 
  requirements that uh that I'm going to go over are you know uh 
  the requirements that we have chosen for uh implementing our 
  decentralized identifiers identity uh capabilities uh that meet 
  our operational needs in particular the operational needs of 2 of 
  the oldest parts of the US government US citizenship and 
  immigration services that is in the business of issuing digital 
  credentials that are relevant to uh those 2 things citizenship 
  and Immigration Services think permanent resident card employment 
  authorization document.
Anil John:  Um I I think uh certificates of naturalization uh and 
  citizenship and the like and US Customs and Border Protection uh 
  which is in the business of issuing credentials uh that are 
  related to cross border trade and travel uh uh so think about uh 
  all the trade documents uh that are needed to be presented to a 
  US Customs in order to bring Goods into the country and to 
  expediate arrival uh into the country like a CT path credentials 
  for those who are familiar with that uh piece of it that's like 
  trusted uh Trader dog uh credentials uh that are also credentials 
  from the people's side of US Customs and Border Protection that 
  you may be a familiar with like our Global Entry credentials are 
  Nexus and cry credentials and the like and last but not least uh 
  these requirements are also um you know coming uh from another 
  organizations within DHS uh at DHS privacy office which basically 
  was the.
Anil John:   First uh.
Anil John:  Office that was stood up as part of statue um um 
  within the US government itself so uh you're going to uh you're 
  going to hear about some of the choices that we're making I also 
  want to be very clear um in saying that these are requirements 
  and this is not a profile and the difference is important because 
  requirements sort of give the outer boundary of what we will not 
  go beyond and the choices that we will be you know anchoring our 
  implementation on.
Anil John:  Still need to be profiled to ensure interoperability 
  so that is important to consider as well.
Anil John:  Um as we are going through them um it's we're trying 
  to balance you know a 2 um you know high-level approaches here um 
  and implementation should be conservative in ascending behavior 
  and liberal in this uh receiving Behavior Uh originally published 
  uh in the discussion section of the TCP spec um by Jon postel 
  back in the day it goes by postel's law it's also been rebranded 
  as a robustness principle uh I think this was a principle that 
  was really really important to ensure the what became the 
  internet the a philosophy uh that that was very very important in 
  order to ensure you know broad availability and uh you know 
  implementations of flourished uh more than anything else so that 
  is something that is important to us and we're trying to balance 
  that as a public institution uh with the philosophy of and not or 
  and what we.
Anil John:   Mean by.
Anil John:  Um we we do not have the luxury of pivoting into 
  serving you know a very small segment of the population we need 
  to serve everybody as a public institution which means that there 
  are different communities who've made different choices in how 
  they will Implement them and we as an institution and an 
  organization that need to support a global touch Point need to be 
  able to open the aperture in the choices that we're meeting are 
  making as well so you will see that as you are going through uh 
  this more than anything else.
Anil John:  Um as I'm as I'm going through these requirements 
  it's also important to note that there are you know 2 types of 
  you know credentials of a lack of a better word that we are 
  involved in uh because of the uh business drivers for our 
  organization there are the credentials that are uh credentials 
  for people um and uh you know we are calling them obviously 
  personal credentials but we are also dealing with uh you know 
  cross ber trade and supply chain and organizational credentials 
  because we are applying the same set of Technologies to that 
  particular domain as well so we have uh you know supply chain 
  credentials as well the supply chain credentials are typically um 
  you know shared within the context of online transactions but the 
  personal credentials obviously have both the in-person and a 
  online presentation as well so um wanted to wanted to make sure 
  that you understood the different.
Anil John:  Specific context that we are dealing with in the 
  choices that we're making here so speaking to personal 
  credentials um we are grounded in a set of implementation 
  principles when it comes to personal credentials.
Anil John:  We want to ensure that the right to paper is 
  something that is really really um inherent and important so 
  digital for us will never be a requirement it is a choice if 
  somebody wants a digital credential in addition to their 
  paper-based credentials they need to request it and they will get 
  it but we will we will be able to um engage with them whether 
  they are uh you know using a paper-based credential or a digital 
  credential uh uh with at the same level of fidelity uh with the 
  with the ability to conduct the same level of transactions in any 
  way shape or form we definitely want to implement IDs that do not 
  phone home and provide um uh mechanisms that eliminate uh back 
  Channel interactions between the verifier and the issuer without 
  the knowledge of the um uh of the holder of the credentials 
  themselves.
Anil John:  And an obviously you know supporting non-track 
  selective disclosure uh you know to provide um you know granular 
  control over data that is released it becomes really really 
  important for us as well and you know and obviously you know that 
  that um you know providing that uh uh non-correlated disclosure 
  uh is uh critically important uh it um it was a challenge to 
  figure out how uh uh our way forward on that but I believe that 
  we have come up with a way that uh allows us to deploy this 
  technology on a US Government Network while uh at the same time 
  meeting our privacy commitments to do so as well and last but not 
  least um.
Anil John:   We are.
Anil John:  Much interested in ensuring that there is a there 
  exists an ecosystem that is vibrant interoperable that has Choice 
  um in the marketplace of the technologies that you are using and 
  the vendors that you are you know sourcing uh those Technologies 
  from uh that are based on standards and are tested and 
  interoperable we've been too often in the past been walked into 
  vendor specific and proprietary implementation uh that uh did not 
  meet the needs of anyone but the vendor that was selling is that 
  technology we are not interested in going down that path uh in 
  this journey and that is also 1 of our you know foundational uh 
  uh uh implementation principles for our uh personal credentials 
  here as well.
Anil John:  Speaking of uh you know in-person usage of personal 
  credentials we're going a little bit differently than uh a lot of 
  the conversations that are going on in the ecosystem.
Anil John:  Start with we fundamentally believe that we have a 
  very solid uh uh uh paper-based credential uh we we spent a 
  significant amount of you know time threshold and attention to 
  make sure that it is you know secure um that it cannot be you 
  know uh replicated uh without uh a significant amount of effort 
  uh I will never say it cannot be replicated because that would be 
  a lie um uh but at the same time you know in the current stage of 
  paper-based credentials uh what we call read to verify.
Anil John:  It also has the benefit of being an inclusive um 
  credential that is globally usable you do not need a thousand 
  dollar mobile phone in order to uh use that credential um and 
  even more important from a US Government perspective.
Anil John:  We have no awareness of how and where that credential 
  is used um uh when you are using a physical credential there is 
  no phone home that is happening so when we talk about in-person 
  presentations we need those uh inclusiveness we need that Global 
  usage uh we need that Comfort level with the technology for 
  people who do not want to use a technical solution and we also 
  want that you know counter tracking counter uh surveillance 
  capability that is built into a physical credentials to persist 
  in whatever changes or updates that we make to those physical 
  credentials and the changes that we are making to those physical 
  credentials in order to enable digital verification of physical 
  credentials enable just that it doesn't change that inclusiveness 
  um aspect it doesn't uh uh it doesn't change the uh uh uh no 
  phone home properties what we're doing here as we're moving from 
  our retail.
Anil John:   Verify to a scan.
Anil John:  Code uh is and I'll I'll get into the details of that 
  in the next slide is providing that same capability in the 
  physical credential um that uh you currently have um you know.
Anil John:  Capabilities for digital verification without the you 
  know the the correlation piece that we have with the current 
  physical credentials themselves um in the long term we hope to 
  move to a tap to verify capability whereby the same property 
  persist but you basically have a much more streamlined and a 
  local digital verification using NFC uh that also routes around 
  perhaps uh the constraints on the usage of NFC radio's um in 
  mobile devices and the like so when we talk about scan to verify 
  what does that mean it's very simple actually conceptually um the 
  input to uh creating a digitally signed barcode um uh a digitally 
  signed uh credential is actually the the mrz um on the back of 
  this card uh the 2D barcode uh payload is the mrz or uh for those 
  of those like me who were break.
Anil John:   Raised with the Kings.
<pl/t3> CBOR = dehydrated credential LOL!!
Anil John:  Mrz uh that is the input um in addition to the 
  decentralized identifiers that basically provides a mechanism to 
  retrieve the public key that can be used to verify and validate 
  the credential that basically goes into a process that generates 
  a core LD mechanism AKA we call it a dehydrated verify the 
  credential that is that can be represented in a 2d barcode um it 
  continues to you know provide that uh inclusive Global usage 
  without the need for a mobile device we continue to have no 
  awareness of where that credential is used um you have the 
  ability to you know retrieve and cache the public key that can be 
  used to verify that digital signature um so that you don't even 
  have to make a network cop you know to locally verify that 
  digital signature um on the on the uh physical credential itself 
  this is our pathway for in the near-term to midterm for.
Anil John:  In person presentation of our credentials now does 
  that mean that we will not go down the path or providing 
  in-person presentation for our digital credentials absolutely we 
  will but we want to get that right and not fast we want to work 
  out the privacy concerns around them we want to work out the uh 
  the openness and the ability to use the technology in a manner uh 
  that is not constrained by platforms and the like uh to be worked 
  out so we are we are comfortable with this approach for our 
  physical credentials more than anything else.
Anil John:  And obviously um 1 thing that we are obviously using 
  here as I mentioned earlier is uh in addition to the verify the 
  credentials data model as a credential representation standard we 
  are actually using decentralized identifier.
Anil John:  Particular did web as a mechanism for us to 
  distribute the public keys that are associated with us as an 
  organization I want to be very clear did Webb in our usage.
<taylor_kendal_(lef)> @PL stealing that one for sure! Just add 
  water :)
Anil John:  Identifies the issuers of the credential AKA uh US 
  citizenship and immigration service and US citizenship and uh US 
  Customs and Border Protection it is did web web is absolutely not 
  as an used as an identifier for people uh because that would be 
  highly correlated and that is not a path to success so we use did 
  web as a mechanism to distribute um you know keys at scale um and 
  that is important to us uh both for the physical credentials and 
  obviously for our you know online usage here as well.
Anil John:  The for the online usage here obviously we are using 
  verify the credentials data model and w3c uh you know DS as well 
  um as the core standards um I think it is.
Anil John:  Is it is.
Anil John:  Very important to sort of understand.
<anil_john_[us/dhs/svip]> Better Outcomes through Wide Review  
Anil John:  The sum of the rationale for why we beyond our 
  participation here um in the w3c on why we um.
Anil John:  Uh what what we've Chosen and anchored our standards 
  on the w3c standards themselves and I put something into the chat 
  right now it was a presentation that was given by you know Daniel 
  applequist uh a who is a member of the w3c technical architecture 
  group um you know last month at the open source Summit in 
  Seattle.
Anil John:  Uh the the horizontal reviews that are being done as 
  part of any standardization process um uh a w3c that take into 
  account uh International internationalization uh security privacy 
  um and a variety of other aspects of uh on the technical 
  architecture side as well.
Anil John:  In the current state of Technology it is not just 
  important to just have um you know code that works and uh you 
  know a some consensus that the this is yearly good we we are at 
  the stage of Technology where it is really really important that 
  you know standards creators and standards implementers need to 
  understand the consequences of the standards um and the choices 
  that can be made using those standards and the horizontal reviews 
  and the wide reviews that w3c provides you know across um the 
  domains is critical in ensuring that the standards themselves you 
  know bacon you know those type of aspects into what is uh what is 
  implementable uh that tends to be sometimes you know frustrating 
  to you know technical folks but as a technologist who works for a 
  you know public sector entity uh there is a absolutely a level of 
  comfort.
Anil John:  In having those you know broad independent reviews 
  and people you know poking under the covers on exactly what the 
  impact of a particular standards and Technology are uh you know 
  before you know people like us Implement that so you know that is 
  you know if you haven't seen Daniel's presentation or if you've 
  not you know if you do not know about the horizontal reviews that 
  w3c you know um you know puts every standards through uh please 
  do take a look at the uh YouTube uh recording of um.
https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials/issues/115
Anil John:  Uh of of this presentation there.
Anil John:  So um you know getting into the uh the details here 
  um as I mentioned these are requirements wreck requirements are 
  not profiles there is still work to be done in order to profile 
  the standards for implementation but I wanted to you know 
  separate what you're going to be seeing um uh.
Anil John:  Into you know 3 buckets.
Anil John:  What are the expectations of a personal credential 
  issuer uh implemented by DHS what are the expectations of a 
  personal credential verifier that is implemented by DHS what are 
  the you know and obvious and what are the implications of a 
  digital wallet that is implemented by DHS and sort of go down 
  deep into uh into them um.
Anil John:  Lab between them but I also want to be very very 
  clear that this was you know the all of these are important to us 
  so I I you know we definitely you know uh.
Anil John:  Clarified each of them rather than sort of getting 
  them lost um in a in a wholesome medal there right um the.
Anil John:  Uh conventions that we're using are you know coming 
  from ISO if you're in a you are seeing you're going to be C 
  seeing requirements with the chillon shall not.
Anil John:  Recommendations um you know using should and should 
  not and permission May and may not and possibility as you see fit 
  so moving on.
Anil John:  Um we start with accessibility and openness when it 
  comes to our implementation for digital credentials.
Anil John:   There is.
Anil John:  Only 1 shall not you will see in this document and 
  that is that first 1.
Anil John:  A DHS uh you know issue or shall not Implement 
  capabilities that enable tracking of holder credential use full 
  stop we think um you know if you are a public institution this 
  tends to be something that is often brought up and we wanted to 
  make sure that the choices and the technologies that we are using 
  and implementing you know down to the choices that we make at the 
  implementation level uh bacon you know that particular 
  requirement here.
<pl/t3> This is a great list of considerations for any VC 
  implementer.
Anil John:  Accessibility is really really important so for us um 
  the ability to use um you know web content uh accessibility 
  guidelines um which is actually the foundation on which the you 
  know section 508 of the US uh rehab Act is based on uh needs to 
  be incorporated into our issuer wallet and verifier 
  implementations as well uh we lean into and prioritize open 
  royalty-free freely available you know standards and 
  specifications that can be implemented by a 1-person shop all the 
  way to a state level actor uh as the thing that we will always 
  choose first um we require that the wallet um um excuse me we 
  require that uh if you are an issuer the issuer needs to give um 
  the holder the ability to choose the digital wallet of the 
  choice.
Anil John:   We support our dig.
Anil John:  Are implemented using both.
Anil John:  Platform Technologies as well as native platform 
  Technologies as well.
Anil John:  The when it comes to the platform and software 
  security uh piece of it uh.
Anil John:  We are we will be we require the use of cryptographic 
  modules that have been validated by the cmvp program uh which uh 
  for those of you who if you're on the cryptographic space you 
  know what that is but as a join program that is run by US and 
  Canada uh that validates cryptographic modules that can be used 
  within government networks and obviously uh we need those 
  cryptographic key storage mechanisms to the fips 140 compliant.
Anil John:  Implementations rights for the uh for the verifiers 
  issues and wallets um it is really really important that we have 
  a sense of and a clear idea of the components that go into those 
  products themselves so a software bill of material that clearly 
  shares information on the sub components that go into the 
  building of an issuer a verifier and a wallet that we Implement 
  is critically important because when vulnerabilities come up when 
  problems come up we want to know if any of the components of the 
  software that we're running are impacted and we want to make sure 
  that we are able to mitigate them um so s bombs are really really 
  important this actually is something that is driven um and there 
  is common agreement both across the public sector and the private 
  sector that uh software bill of materials and visibility into 
  supply chain um of the software itself is critically important so 
  this is something that is a requirement for us as well.
Anil John:  Now we get into the some of the details of the 
  credential formats and the digital signatures that we have you 
  know chosen as our implementation requirement we'll start with 
  the first 1 when it comes to credential format uh we are choosing 
  w3c where a barber credentials data model uh that is using Json 
  LD compacted document form this is version 2.0 of the standard as 
  you know version 1.0 came out in I believe on 2018 or so it was 
  then updated to version 1.1 um in around 2022 and we are you know 
  1 Step removed from the global uh standardization of version 2.0 
  for uh bcdm so uh this is a standard that is you know gone 
  through a significant amount of uh iterations and input and we 
  are comfortable with choosing them uh as that our foundational 
  model um before we.
Anil John:   Get into the.
Anil John:  Other piece of.
Anil John:  I wanted I wanted to.
Anil John:  A little bit on this I've often found that within our 
  community um.
Anil John:  Was a little bit of hand waving going on over the 
  choice between and the value word of the variety of different 
  data models that are there and in fact as somebody who is um a 
  reader of meeting minutes from way back in the verifiable 
  credentials working group it itself I have been semi amused to 
  note that whenever some somebody brings up uh a desire to put 
  into the standard itself what is the value of the underlying data 
  format itself uh you know that cans to be downplayed um and it 
  seems to Die the death of a Thousand Cuts more than anything else 
  so.
Anil John:   I want.
Anil John:  We are choosing vcd uh verify but w3c verify the 
  credentials data model 2.0 uh as the uh the core um you know 
  credential data format for our credential uh issuance more than 
  anything else it it starts with something very simple um a lot of 
  people in the identity world come to Identity from the 
  authentication side of the house.
Anil John:  But at the end of the road authentication is only 1 
  piece of the identity equation is uh you know uh needed but it's 
  not sufficient in know the grain access or to uh do a business 
  process for that you actually need a lot of additional 
  information uh in order to be conveyed from 1 party to the other 
  from a uh from a credential to a a a verifier in order to make 
  those type of decisions it need to be combined with other types 
  of information in order to actually make decisions so the ability 
  to represent information uh you know uh.
Anil John:  Data but information so that common meaning is 
  understand understood on both ends of the wire is particularly a 
  pretty critically important and that semantic um understanding is 
  possible because of the data model of the w3c vcd.
Anil John:  Um and it also brings another benefit here uh the 
  ability to publish that information to the public um whether it 
  is as a context or uh uh whether it is as um you know human 
  readable information such that there is very clear understanding 
  of what terms are in a credential what terms are acceptable to an 
  organization is becomes very very important um uh the term 
  published and discover is not mine um I actually completely and 
  totally stole that from um a wonderful person by the name of 
  Nancy Norris uh who works for the uh government of British 
  Columbia who is doing some fabulous work in crossborder trade for 
  the uh government of British Columbia in Canada and uh she used 
  that term with me 1 time when it when speaking to Json LD and uh 
  and I thought that was so appropriate so the ability to publish 
  and describe uh information uh is very becomes very very possible 
  with vcd um.
Anil John:  Ability to provide.
Anil John:  Built-in namespaces and versioning using contacts is 
  a clear um uh capability uh for w3c vcd and there's a whole bunch 
  of other people and other credential types that are you know that 
  that need to you know reinvent the wheels like uh in doing you 
  know namespaces and uh versioning using oids and variety of other 
  you know uh namespacing mechanism more than anything else this is 
  built-in and comes for the ride with uh you know w3c vcm 
  multi-language support um I think uh clear example of that I 
  think uh sometime ago I think the um.
Anil John:  What is the California DMV published the open Credit 
  platform they actually showed an example of multi-language 
  capabilities that are possible when it comes to uh you know the 
  use of vcd so I would I'd urge you to look at that um as you all 
  know uh the verifiable credential data model supports multiple 
  signature types uh you actually have you know uh enveloping 
  signature types using you know Jose um and cos um and you also 
  have embedded signature types are using um data Integrity proofs 
  as well we actually end up uh using uh both but for different use 
  cases so the ability to sort of use them flexibility is a a 
  significant benefit uh to what uh vcd brings to the table.
Anil John:   The ability.
Anil John:  Know if you are comfortable with Json Json all the 
  apis.
Anil John:  Go to town if you're not don't uh you have the 
  ability to use you know standard uh Json apis provided that you 
  are very very you know uh uh mindful about the actual you know 
  structure of the credential itself as written in the vcd spec 
  itself and last but not least an example of what I mean by 
  dehydro dehydrated binary uh barcodes is our example of using you 
  know sibo LD a dehydrated version of verifiable credentials uh 
  that can be resident on a on a uh on a physical credentials all 
  of this with the same standard the same specification incredible 
  flexibility incredible amount of power and the ability to not 
  come up with a new standard for every other type of credential um 
  and new data model for different types of credentials is just 
  amazing and is 1 of the reasons that we chosen bcdm as the uh the 
  core standard for us.
Anil John:   We are.
Anil John:  Signature format um data Integrity uh proofs for 
  personal credentials because it solves and addresses something 
  very very important to us.
Anil John:  Which is as a US Government entity we require that 
  the cryptography that is deployed on our Network needs to be fips 
  compliant but we also are leaning forward to ensure that we are 
  also providing privacy capabilities like selective disclosure uh 
  that cannot be correlated on signatures and the like those at the 
  present tend to be could be considered uh irreconcilable but we 
  found a way to reconcile them by using proof sets in data 
  Integrity proofs and what I mean by that is is the ability to 
  basically apply multiple proofs 1 proof 1 that is using fips 
  compliant cryptographic Primitives the other 1 that is using a 
  non-correlated uh uh cryptographic Primitives like BBS a plus uh 
  in order to sign the document itself the fascinating thing is 
  that we uh you know we.
Anil John:   We had an extensive.
Anil John:  Technical Authority on this 1 and um it was 
  discovered that this is.
Anil John:  Up to and including cmvp validation um uh dual 
  signatures as NYS calls them a fully acceptable in fact if you 
  take a um a cryptographic module that contains both a fibs 
  compliant um cryptographic primitive as well as a for example a 
  BBS cryptographic Primitives through the cmvp program um you will 
  notice that the cmvp program will actually um is allowed to list 
  the non fips compliant cryptography on the fips validation 
  certificate below the line for 1 particular reason to Showcase 
  that it doesn't invalidate cmvp um you know uh certification 
  itself uh so a lot more details uh take a look at the uh the 
  background um I actually have a provided to the the relevant 
  authoritative references from nist uh in the on the background of 
  the slides that have been shared with you so take a look at it.
Anil John:   So we are.
Anil John:  That capability uh in order to uh uh either provide 
  both non-correlated with signatures and fips compliance 
  signatures so that we are able to meet both our security and our 
  privacy commitments in the credent that we are doing.
Anil John:  And as I mentioned earlier we're using an 
  implementing uh in a w3c did standard um uh before I come back to 
  biting status list um 1 change that I will note here because it 
  is um it is a it is a recommendation in the did standard we 
  actually require that the did document be digitally signed to 
  ensure its integrity and its Providence but other than that we 
  are using uh the did standards in particular did web as a 
  mechanism to identify us as an organization and to distribute our 
  public keys that can be used to you know uh review and um.
Anil John:  Ate a credentials.
Anil John:   We are.
<dmitri_zagidulin> YESSS haha, big +1 to signing DID Documents
Anil John:  Using w3c bitstring status list for for credential 
  status um uh checks um there is again um I will stress again and 
  again requirements and not a profile uh if you know anything 
  about the bit string status list you know that there are multiple 
  ways of representing how uh you know credentials that can be um 
  what is it uh uh uh that can only be revoked and credentials that 
  can be revoked and suspended how do you represent them there are 
  multiple ways of doing them so profiling is needed uh 
  implementations matter because when you implement a bit string 
  status list as a verifier uh excuse me as an issuer.
Anil John:  Uh which we are um if somebody is calling in to check 
  the status of a credentials we actually do not know about who 
  whose credential is being checked that's 1 measure of privacy and 
  um that is provided but implementations matter in order to ensure 
  that we don't even have any awareness of who is calling us you 
  need to make sure that the verifier implements that call through 
  uh implementing something like you know oblivious HTTP so that 
  the identity of the verifier is also hidden from the issuer so 
  the choices that we make in these implementations still need to 
  be worked out and that is something that we are you know walking 
  through very very carefully you know here as well uh we've worked 
  out in the open with the ccg with this group uh as citizenship 
  vocabulary that that is going to be used in order to represent 
  the credentials that we are using.
Anil John:  Um and that is something that is a requirement for us 
  as well.
Anil John:  Um we are also some we are also considering you know 
  something else here as well um we believe that it is important if 
  you are if you're an organization that is an issuer that you.
<anil_john_[us/dhs/svip]> High Assurance DIDs with DNS  
Anil John:  And behind your identifier you stand behind the 
  credentials that you issue so that when somebody says that hey 
  did Webb uscis.gov means us uh CIS itself usci we want to make 
  sure that there is um you know there is a mechanism that allows a 
  counterparty to actually you know verify that that domain and 
  that identifier actually belong to a legitimate US Government 
  editing.
Anil John:  You can read faster than I can I also put into the 
  chat um 1 of the things that we are looking at high Assurance did 
  with DNS uh the in general at a very high level uh I mentioned 
  earlier that you are signing the did document now in order to 
  validate that the document you obviously need a you know public 
  certificate uh this High Assurance did with DNS provides a 
  mechanism whereby you can basically put that public certificate 
  that signed the the document in the tlsa record of a domain um so 
  like uscis.gov so that you have and the ability to ensure that a 
  legitimate dog gov domain uh is indeed the authoritative owner of 
  that um uh of that identifier that is then used to basically you 
  know issue those credentials itself uh again uh take a look at 
  the high Insurance did with the.
Anil John:  Piece that I put.
Anil John:  It is something that we are seriously considering um 
  primarily because it doesn't require any new standards or 
  capabilities you have the ability to use existing you know did uh 
  uh Technologies as well as DNS Technologies to actually uh you 
  know get to the capabilities that we're talking about here as 
  well.
Anil John:  And let's see.
Anil John:  Issuance protocols this is all this is definitely 
  something that we are we are going to be testing very carefully 
  um.
Anil John:  Let's start with the in a Basics here we intend to 
  support multiple issuance protocols full stop because we have a 
  broad set of communities that uh that uh that we need to serve 
  the choices before us tend to be on the issuance side VC API from 
  W3 cccg and oids for VCI oid 4 for VCI from the digital 
  credential protocol group at ovf.
Anil John:  Our choices when this moves from TBD to this is a 
  choice is a contingent upon the issuance protocol actually 
  supporting the credential format in the digital signature 
  mechanisms that we've just talked about we're not big Believers 
  and let's put it on paper or let's have a t-shirt or anything 
  like that uh uh to uh to say that we supported we are going to 
  test we are going to verify and only after we are confident that 
  our credentials are security formats and uh the choices that 
  ensure privacy for our customers and security for our customers 
  are you know are supported by those issues protocols will we 
  basically move from a TBD to an actual actual choices between 
  them but the as as you note here this is something that the the 
  the the the the 2 choices that we are actively evaluating are 
  those 2 uh that that you see here.
Anil John:  So moving on to the credential verify piece I think a 
  whole lot of this is you know is duplicative I will just call out 
  the things that are you know different more than anything else uh 
  the only thing that I will see here is the last statement on the 
  verifier uh May Implement additional credential data formats and 
  Associated proof mechanisms um.
Anil John:  We require the things that we are talking about about 
  their for credential formats and digital signatures we have 
  reserved the right to you know validate and verify additional 
  credential formats are Downstream we don't have any at this point 
  in time but this is uh we we are leading open that possibility 
  and particularly for you know there are companies that are 
  implementing these capabilities under contract to us we wanted to 
  make sure that they have the flexibility based on their um you 
  know customer needs and things like that to support not just our 
  requirements but also the requirements of others as well that is 
  why that language is there um.
Anil John:  Only difference here on the metadata is that 
  obviously this is the reverse if you're going to sign the did 
  document you better verify the digital signature on the did 
  document there as well.
Anil John:  And you've seen this before.
Anil John:  From The Exchange protocol side the same caveats as 
  before with 1 Edition here we are actively tracking the digital 
  credentials API work uh in the w3c Wai Sig which I believe is um 
  you know uh potentially moving into the Federated identity 
  working group itself uh I think the the feedback that the w3c 
  staff collected um from the community uh on what uh that work 
  needs to Encompass is spot on and we support them um so we are 
  actually tracking that as well so for the present presentation 
  piece uh that is important we also hope that uh it will also 
  include an issuance piece as well so um if that if that becomes 
  real we it will also be a choice for our issuance protocol as 
  well.
Anil John:  Um on the wallet side uh.
Anil John:   Same here.
Anil John:  Here uh nothing new that you will not see uh you know 
  specific details around how you sort of present the credentials 
  and things like that but as far as the credential form as a 
  digital signatures uh you absolutely uh you know uh you're going 
  to see consistency here and obviously in a wallet um we want we 
  you know we are going through the process and we will go through 
  the process on figuring out you know what is an acceptable wallet 
  I don't think the community has done enough work to understand 
  the security privacy and interoperability criteria that 1 can use 
  in order to judge the quote unquote goodness of a wallet um so um 
  so what that basically means is in addition to our own wallet uh 
  that we uh that we would have we fully anticipate uh the ability 
  to issue credentials into external wallet that we can all agree 
  on a common based on of security privacy and interoperability.
Anil John:  Actually support credential types that are Beyond um 
  what we have outlined as our requirements and that is perfectly 
  fine so that last data uh last statement is very much focused on 
  that um.
Anil John:  Insurance protocol and the exchange protocol piece is 
  you know definitely the same um normative references for personal 
  credentials but I also wanted to basically touch on our supply 
  chain uh uh and organizational credentials piece as well.
Anil John:  You will notice that um when it comes to the 
  credential format and digital signatures we actually have the 
  same credential format Json LD compacted data form of w3c VC data 
  model.
Anil John:  We are using a different signature format we are 
  actually using you know w3c um you know securing w3c VCS with 
  Jose and co uh specification uh and in fact using Jose as the uh 
  digital signature mechanism it is very simple for why we are 
  doing it on the trade side we do not have a non-correlated 
  ability requirement and we do not have a requirement to 
  simultaneously provide you know fips compliant and non-correlated 
  signature if you know anything about the supply chain it is 
  entirely about getting deep visibility into the supply chain of 
  goods that are moving into the US um we want to you know go as 
  far as far back to the origin of goods in order to understand 
  whether uh these goods were created using forced Labor uh these 
  uh these were transship to other entities in order to import them 
  into the US so uh correlate with ability is something that 
  happen.
Anil John:   Happens within the.
Anil John:  Chain credentials uh and organizational credentials 
  so we do not have a non-correlated ability a piece uh within the 
  supply chain piece we do not have a selective disclosure uh 
  requirement currently within the the trade piece as well so that 
  is the reason that we've chosen the other signature format uh for 
  here and separately you know we are also again we're using the um 
  bit string status list as the um uh revocation mechanism and 
  we're using Trace vocabulary as a mechanism for sharing our 
  vocabulary with the public and what we expect.
Anil John:  The 8 the actual Protocols are actually an A A 
  variation on an oath based protocol that was defined under the 
  w3c called the trace API links are in the normative guidance 
  here.
Anil John:   So that.
Anil John:  That is that is something obviously fits naturally 
  with the organization to organization credential flows for um you 
  know uh for supply chain credentials so I know that that I've 
  gone through again uh very similar variation on this 1 as well I 
  know that I've gone very fast through all of them and I wanted to 
  stop there just to at least you know take any questions that you 
  might have on the line.
Harrison_Tang: Questions for now.
<pl/t3> Great Job Anil
Arjen_van_Veen_(SpruceID):  out of.
Arjen_van_Veen_(SpruceID): Question about CBR lb specifically um.
Arjen_van_Veen_(SpruceID): A while ago I made an implementation 
  of sabar LD but um.
Arjen_van_Veen_(SpruceID):  as far.
Arjen_van_Veen_(SpruceID): Far as I remember there is no uh 
  support for like versioning of the the compression dictionary 
  does that exist today because I was I was trying to find like an 
  up-to-date spec but.
Arjen_van_Veen_(SpruceID): End up on a on a page that that 
  doesn't exist anymore of what was supposed to be a rough spec so 
  could you give an update of where CBR LD is today.
Anil John:  For sure and in fact uh I actually will punt that to 
  minus Pony who's waiting on the line I'm sure that who can speak 
  to that much better than eloquently than I can.
Benjamin Young: https://json-ld.github.io/cbor-ld-spec/
Manu Sporny:  Thanks Neil I don't know about eloquently um so 
  Arin um the the specification was moved um uh into the Json LD 
  community group uh so it's been adopted that's why the Old Link 
  you're using no longer works there is a plan to take its 
  standards track in the next iteration of the Json LD or linked 
  data uh community group um it it does the their in 1 of the 
  things that we're looking at is kind of the versioning of the 
  compression dictionaries and and things of that nature um right 
  now you kind of need to understand you know what type of 
  credential you're going to be reading um before you pull it in um 
  so all that to say happy to engage with you more on the Json l in 
  the Json LD group or in the upcoming working group uh to you know 
  um help with implementations I will readily admit that spec is 
  dragging behind the other ones just because.
Manu Sporny:  There's so much other work um you know around uh 
  the the current setup work uh in any case yes uh happy to happy 
  to sync offline uh on that.
Harrison_Tang: All right Phil you're next in the queue.
<susan_stroud> Are there any working groups, or the like, focused 
  on describing a quality/compliant wallet?  (I'm unable to come 
  off mute)
PL/T3: Yes um Neil thank you for the presentation I'm just 
  wondering when you reference the um High Assurance did with DNS 
  it sounds almost like it is an interim or at least an alternative 
  for a uh repository of issuers and verifiers approach um that 
  takes advantage of DNS for that function in at least a limited 
  form is that is that a fair interpretation.
<manu_sporny> No, there aren't Susan, at least, not yet -- most 
  of the work is more "lower level" than that.
<manu_sporny> (at least, not at W3C)
Anil John:  I I don't look at it that way so 1 of the things that 
  is important to understand at least about the you know what what 
  we call you know dot gov binding here right is that uh it's 
  important to understand that the dot gov top level domain is 
  actually managed by the US government in fact it's actually 
  managed by a part of DHS cisa um and it's only uh available to 
  you know US Government entities whether it is federal state local 
  tribal or Territorial and there is a very stringent process 
  whereby um an entity will be provisioned a.gov domain um uh uh 
  you know uh.
Anil John:  Wanted to basically leverage that to ensure that if 
  you are interacting with the US government entity you had full 
  confidence that entity was a legitimate US government 
  organization so um.
<harrison_tang> @Susan You can check out OpenWallet Foundation 
  https://openwallet.foundation/
Anil John:  So the ability to provide a linked cryptographic link 
  between the dead web and the dot gov domain that uh allowed for 
  that verification to happen is really really uh a valuable for us 
  so uh.
Anil John:  Stop there Phil I I know that if you read the spec 
  itself um and I would recommend that you speak to the editors 
  whether it is you know Tim Boma or the folks from Sir which is a 
  Canadian registar as well as mattea's from northern block um it 
  can be you know used with any domain so there is Broad 
  applicability but we want to sort of Leverage The Real Estate 
  that we have access to in order to ensure that we showed The 
  Binding of ourselves as a legitimate government entity.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks um and thanks again Anil this is 
  fantastic as usual I was really happy to hear you mention that 
  you'll be signing the did Webb did document uh so that's always 
  good and I'm hoping you're keeping an eye on some of the did Webb 
  enhancement proposals like trusted did Webb method uh which 
  basically.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Had the signature to the document and then add 
  a signed log of key rotation events.
Anil John:  I am absolutely uh keeping track of it um I I love 
  the work that uh the government of British Columbia recently did 
  on this 1 and obviously you know have you noticed there's a theme 
  here uh this work came out of the Canadians as well um so um I'm 
  really glad of the work and keeping track of it uh you know 
  anything that sort of uh you know gives High assurances to the 
  decentralized identity um uh dids uh is a good thing in my mind 
  um so we definitely definitely keeping track of that.
Stephan_Baur: Yeah hello thank you and your great presentation 
  good to hear about all this um my question I actually have 2 
  questions the first 1 is uh what's the target issuer sort of 
  community or or population for it is it just US Federal 
  governments or is it anybody.
Anil John:  Um my the requirements that I spoke about are the 
  requirements of um the the entities that issue cross border trade 
  and cross border you know travel within the US government which 
  tends to be US citizenship and immigration services and US 
  citizenship at US Customs and Border Protection uh those are the 
  issuers of those credentials uh those credentials in general are 
  used broadly um obviously if you are moving uh any Goods into the 
  US you are going to be interacting with US Customs and using 
  these credentials so that's public sector private sector you know 
  globally um the our digital immigration credentials are used for 
  everything from kyc to showing you know residency um and 
  employment eligibility in order to apply for a job so the usage 
  of the credentials tend to be uh you know both uh much broader uh 
  but the issue.
Anil John:  We are the issuers.
Stephan_Baur: Yep all right makes sense um and then um the second 
  question is so I understand then I will be parallel signatures 
  for the proofs 1 being.
Stephan_Baur:  you know.
Stephan_Baur: Compliant but therefore traceable and 1 being BDS 
  or style like that therefore not traceable is there or should 
  there perhaps be something that would.
Stephan_Baur: Um almost make it a requirement for verifiers.
Stephan_Baur: To use the non-racket 1 on users.
Anil John:  Um this is where Anil John the technologists who 
  works for a a a for a US Government entity becomes very very 
  careful because you just crossed into the line of Regulation and 
  law um and I prefer not to opine on that what I will note is for 
  our verifier you will notice a couple of specific uh languages 
  here that I'm showing here um we note that um in general when a 
  negotiation happens between a digital wallet and a verifier on 
  which you know uh cryptographic um you know signing scheme in 
  order to use in order to share um information.
Anil John:  That the verifier should prioritize the minimal 
  disclosure of data and metadata by the holder um uh when 
  negotiating a mutually acceptable proof.
Anil John:  And I will leave it at that I think um there are I'm 
  sure there are folks from the uh you know from the policy side 
  from the privacy and civil liberty Community sides who can 
  basically probably share more information on what it would take 
  in order for verifies for that to be binding uh on it we do not 
  have the equivalent regulation perhaps that the uh the the 
  European Union or other countries have in not a sort of make that 
  binding on a verifier.
Harrison_Tang: Well thanks thanks everyone for a great questions 
  and thanks Anil for yet another great presentation uh if anyone 
  else due to the time constraints uh we won't take any further 
  questions but if anyone else have questions feel free to just uh 
  uh respond to the public email thread uh and obviously if uh 
  there's so many questions I'll try to schedule a follow-up 
  conversation with a Neil so that people can uh have further and 
  continue this discussion all right thanks Anil thanks for 
  shopping on.
<arjen_van_veen_(spruceid)> thank you anil!
Harrison_Tang: Right this concludes this week's ccg meeting and 
  uh we'll see you next week thanks.
