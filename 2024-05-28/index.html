<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Anil John</span>:  Still need to be profiled to ensure interoperability so that is important to consider as well. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Anil John</span>:  Um as we are going through them um it&apos;s we&apos;re trying to balance you know a 2 um you know high-level approaches here um and implementation should be conservative in ascending behavior and liberal in this uh receiving Behavior Uh originally published uh in the discussion section of the TCP spec um by Jon postel back in the day it goes by postel&apos;s law it&apos;s also been rebranded as a robustness principle uh I think this was a principle that was really really important to ensure the what became the internet the a philosophy uh that that was very very important in order to ensure you know broad availability and uh you know implementations of flourished uh more than anything else so that is something that is important to us and we&apos;re trying to balance that as a public institution uh with the philosophy of and not or and what we. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Anil John</span>:  Um as I&apos;m as I&apos;m going through these requirements it&apos;s also important to note that there are you know 2 types of you know credentials of a lack of a better word that we are involved in uh because of the uh business drivers for our organization there are the credentials that are uh credentials for people um and uh you know we are calling them obviously personal credentials but we are also dealing with uh you know cross ber trade and supply chain and organizational credentials because we are applying the same set of Technologies to that particular domain as well so we have uh you know supply chain credentials as well the supply chain credentials are typically um you know shared within the context of online transactions but the personal credentials obviously have both the in-person and a online presentation as well so um wanted to wanted to make sure that you understood the different. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Anil John</span>:  We want to ensure that the right to paper is something that is really really um inherent and important so digital for us will never be a requirement it is a choice if somebody wants a digital credential in addition to their paper-based credentials they need to request it and they will get it but we will we will be able to um engage with them whether they are uh you know using a paper-based credential or a digital credential uh uh with at the same level of fidelity uh with the with the ability to conduct the same level of transactions in any way shape or form we definitely want to implement IDs that do not phone home and provide um uh mechanisms that eliminate uh back Channel interactions between the verifier and the issuer without the knowledge of the um uh of the holder of the credentials themselves. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
