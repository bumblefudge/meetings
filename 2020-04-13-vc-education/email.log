Kim Hamilton Duffy: Great intro, thanks Nate!

PROPOSAL:  https

Gabe Cohen:  The proposal liked in PDF from the Github Issue 
  above is to add a DID-based identifier type to the list of 
  profile identifier properties. [scribe assist by Nate Otto]
Gabe Cohen:  A couple issues have been brought up as to how you 
  include the DID; how you prove ownership of the DID. Nate has 
  brought up some good points around how how this needs to be easy. 
  [scribe assist by Nate Otto]
Kim Hamilton Duffy: It looks like Simone got booted off the call
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Oh, I see Nate's taking over. Would someone 
  else mind scribing since Nate is co-presenting? it's very 
  distracting
Gabe Cohen:  One great tool available for us is the DIF Universal 
  Resolver. That can get us access to the DID documents. We should 
  next work on challenges for proof of control of a DID. [scribe 
  assist by Nate Otto]
Kim Hamilton Duffy: ...To try to present and scribe :)
Gabe Cohen:  This change would allow badges to be more closely 
  tied into the decentralized world. There may be benefits to 
  having badges issued to DIDs instead of issuers or telephone 
  numbers. This moves the control slightly toward the learner, and 
  opens up more opportunities in the future for that. [scribe 
  assist by Nate Otto]
Gabe Cohen:  We may find that DIDs have more longevity than 
  emails or telephone numbers, as they are self-sovereign. [scribe 
  assist by Nate Otto]

Kim Hamilton Duffy: Did:work:2UUHQCd4psvkPLZGnWY33L
I am back can continue to scribe...
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  ... If we made the OB Data Model udnerstand 
  DID, that would be a new instruction for implementers to use DID 
  resolvers...
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  ... Interested to hear from Nate
Nate Otto:   Real issue is usability - how canwe make this 
  identities visible to users, resvolvable by. users and 
  implementers
Nate Otto:  The issue and recipient and consumer inspector should 
  be on the same page to understand the pointer to the individual 
  and for the individual to approve that
Nate Otto:  Increase capabilites of verifying that the individual 
  control that string .. whether it is a DID or a URL...
Kim Hamilton Duffy: DID SIOP:

Kim Hamilton Duffy: Did:work method: 
  https://workday.github.io/work-did-method-spec/
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Workday team presents a description of the 
  Workday DID Resolver Method and a demo of the user-with-a-DID 
  authentication process as it might be implemented by another 
  partner in the task force
Matt Lisle: Did work interesting did method to test out 
  interoprability... idea: use workday's did process, something to 
  prototype in this group... comments?
Nate Otto:  To adopt changes to spec, need early implementers to 
  try things out... this group might be avenue. lots of other 
  implementers availalbe to try openbadges + SSI [scribe assist by 
  Matt Lisle]
Matt Lisle: In order to pursue proof of concepts, need some 
  agreement on did methods that implementers want to try out
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Some assignee creates and presents an example 
  credential that uses a DID for recipient identification that 
  exemplifies the "Verifiable Credentials for Education" use case: 
  recognition that a recipient has attained a particular "defined 
  achievement", such as a Certificate (awarded on program 
  completion)
Matt Lisle: Interest in DID-web as well as workday's method... 
  test out recipients using different did methods... testing 
  authentication
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Some assignee creates an alternate example 
  set showing how two different issuers might recognize that a 
  recipient has attained a level o mastery of a competency that is 
  defined by a third party (this is not something that is well 
  handled by the Open Badges spec as it currently stands).
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Assumption that there is a learner wallet in 
  order to try these out [scribe assist by Matt Lisle]
Matt Lisle: Badgr is service agent-type pattern... each user has 
  an account, service acts on their behalf... another paradigm is 
  wallet. case of DID authentication is perfect use case for 2 
  paradigms to work togehter (e.g. badgr account and wallet)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Idea of wallet... most think mobile app, but 
  can also be web app/site. could demo both [scribe assist by Matt 
  Lisle]
Matt Lisle: Interest in doing both VC and Openbadges 
  prototypes... (DID support in OB perhaps more feasible than VC in 
  OB)
DIDs into OB2.2 is a clear, measurable and achievable objective
Matt Lisle: (FYI... gotta drop off in a few minutes for next 
  meeting... new scribe needed if we run over)
Nate Otto is scribing.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We'll revisit this topic in future meetings. 
  We want to figure out a good plan so we can move forward.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We'll start talking about plans for that in 
  future meetings. Thank you
