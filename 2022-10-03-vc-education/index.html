<div onmouseout="$('#link-6').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-6').show()" id="6" class="information">Moshe_Tzvi_Wieder: Sure no problem so I guess in no particular order yeah the the question about how could other wallets interact with with the network so and it really goes back to the defined protocols as we mentioned the foundation is who decides kind of what the protocols are those Protocols are public published on our website even the the exist. <a id="link-6" style="display:none;" href="#6">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-7').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-7').show()" id="7" class="information">Moshe_Tzvi_Wieder: All that we mentioned as a placeholder it&apos;s open source and any organization that would like to implement their own wallet as opposed to starting from scratch is as welcome to become a part of the the network and take that open source code and turn it into whatever they need the the wall it is based on defined protocols for sharing. <a id="link-7" style="display:none;" href="#7">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="information">Naomi: I don&apos;t think that that level of information included only because velocity encourage organizations to to interact with velocity using the SDK however you know for example for the plugfest were making the move to the oid see protocol so that may be something that the team can add for the future. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Dmitri Zagidulin</span>:  Encryption instead did I understand correctly. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="information">Moshe_Tzvi_Wieder: It is it is when you say the signature of the issuer so I we may be talking about the same thing what happens is when the issuer issues that credential they are essentially encrypting that credential with a with all the private key encryption and that public the public key that&apos;s used to encrypt that credential is what to put on the on the Chain but it&apos;s essentially the signing Act of the issuer which is causing that to happen. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="information">Moshe_Tzvi_Wieder: That right and so that way while I&apos;ve got that credential file in my mobile device I can&apos;t go in and manipulate it in any way because if the only thing that happened was that I when I received that credential the name of the issuer came along with it or the signature of the you know the the issuer came along with it I could still go in and change it right and so the it&apos;s the fusion of those two at the time of verification when I then. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="information">Moshe_Tzvi_Wieder: That matches the encrypted credential file the marriage of those two the fact that they still match is what ensures me that no nothing tampered with it along the way there. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="information">Moshe_Tzvi_Wieder: So when you see nobody can access it you mean nobody can see the plaintext yeah so that is that is that is to a certain extent what what we&apos;re saying but it&apos;s it&apos;s not necessarily so the encrypt and maybe so maybe encryption is is a common word and not exactly what&apos;s what you&apos;re intending but it&apos;s a it becomes. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
