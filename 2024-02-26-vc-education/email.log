Kaliya Young:  The good thing is um IBEW has expanded with some 
  Regional events uh we have the digital identity unconference your

  places for people to say 1 Guy even camped on the lake last time 
  and took the tram to the conference which was cool.

Dmitri Zagidulin:  On some of her work in the European learning 
  model.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Over to you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Can yes we can.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Wait wait uh before uh before you dive into 
  the detail can I don't think uh or rather uh I'm fairly sure 
  several of the people on the call are unfamiliar with the mapping 
  project so if you want to say a few words about it no worries.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> here's info on the mapping 
  project 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15C0ADBSACQ-ZYF1PnHNjndp0kJYUATFWSf_iYSTOQmg/edit?usp=sharing
<laura_paglione> Thank you!! Yes some background!!
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> and a link directly to the 
  mapping, which is all open 
  https://desm.credentialengine.org/mappings-list
<jeanne_kitchens,_credential_engine> If you want to see the 
  mapping that Ildiko is referring to visit 
  https://desm.credentialengine.org/mappings-list and select 
  "Microcredential Mapping" and Submit.  There's five abstract 
  classes mapped.  Use the buttons/navigation to see the related 
  mappings for Assertion, Micro-credential Claimd etc..
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> Phil is on the call, and so is 
  Jeanne, who are leading the mapping
<phil_barker> I am here :) I don't see Nate O.
<jeanne_kitchens,_credential_engine> The Credential Transparency 
  Description Language (CTDL) is mapped with the Micro-Credential 
  Specification and Owner/Offerer abstract classes.
<jeanne_kitchens,_credential_engine> The global micro-credential 
  schema mapping is a CTDL Advisory Group project.  The CAG came up 
  with examples of benefits of this mapping 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KtSnAKM6QnFw_qmdp1lASei05MkRDf5BQlWox7Xnzp0/edit#heading=h.54wym9lf3ygc
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Challenging for sure, but very interesting 
  and educational.
<jeanne_kitchens,_credential_engine> There is a group in the U.S. 
  proposing a US Qualifications Framework. However, it is not 
  within government.
<jeanne_kitchens,_credential_engine> Hot off the press, 
  Navigating the Micro-Credential Landscape: A Global Mapping 
  Initiative 
  https://credentialengine.org/2024/02/26/navigating-the-micro-credential-landscape-a-global-mapping-initiative/
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> there is work underway for a 
  US qualification framework https://usqf.org/
<phil_(t3)> LOL - yes change in HE in the US is challenging
<jeanne_kitchens,_credential_engine> Great conversation.  I have 
  to leave for another meeting.  The Credential Engine team is 
  happy to answer any questions about the mapping and how the DESM 
  tool works after this meeting jkitchens@credentialengine.org.
<laura_paglione> is the DESM tool only intended for VC/ 
  decentralized identity schema, or is the intention for it to be 
  used for any data schema used across multiple domains.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> @Laura any schemas in any 
  domains, and the tool is open source
<xavi_español_(nttdata)> Does this spine grow with the addition 
  of attributes? Not sure if I understand the mechanics.
<laura_paglione> thx
<phil_barker> Yes, Xavi the spine grows as terms are added from 
  schemas as & when they are needed
<dmitri_zagidulin> я?
<kerri_lemoie> Should Verifiable Credentials be added to the 
  Microcredentials framework?
<phil_(t3)> That's a really important point Phil B. Ildiko really 
  made that clear.
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Exactly, @Phil (T3)
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> it also does not need to be 
  "standards"- It can be any schema
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks!
