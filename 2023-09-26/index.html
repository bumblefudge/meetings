<div onmouseout="$('#link-208').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-208').show()" id="208" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  So the main reason for doing that is it reduces the disclosure proof sizes by considerable amount if you use the hash based approach approach you must disclose all of the hashes every time you do a disclosure proof If you do the atomic signature approach you only disclose the signatures that you that go along with the data that you are disclosing so the sizes go down and enable use cases for when your when your data. <a id="link-208" style="display:none;" href="#208">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-209').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-209').show()" id="209" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah for example like we have use cases where we have to express this stuff in like a QR code and you have to get it in you know the idea behind selective disclosure is you&apos;re trying to minimize the amount of information you&apos;re sharing so we were like well if we have to share less than five claims then we need to make sure that the signature sizes are small enough that we can fit them in a QR code or they can go over you know a single data Block in an NFC. <a id="link-209" style="display:none;" href="#209">✪</a></div>
