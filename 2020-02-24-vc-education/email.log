Greg Nadeau talking about what goes inside the VC "envelope"

Topic: What's inside the credential envelope?

Slide 46 - put achievement (definition) on the outside of the 
  envelope, the assertion on the inside
Juan Caballero: Thanks for that!
Greg Kidd:  What badges does with DIDs is what CLR should do with 
  DIDs (and others?)
Kim Hamilton Duffy: CEDS acronym is "common edu data standard"?
Alex Jackl:  Beauty of having many work streams is that a lot of 
  work being done, and there is coordination leading to a universal 
  direction
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Paper from Nate and me about OB as VCs: 
  https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/final-documents/open-badges-are-verifiable-credentials.md
Nate Otto:  VC envelope and CLR/OB look a but different but there 
  are ways of using it so that it can be compatible, e.g. 
  achievement with a rubric with different achievement levels, can 
  link achievement level from rubric
Juan Caballero: ^Hehe I was there! Didn
Juan Caballero: 'T understand much at the time, tho :D
Simone Ravaoli: +1 On Nate
Jim Goodell:  CEDS is US edu-supported group focusing on data 
  vocab, logical models [scribe assist by Kim Hamilton Duffy]
Kim Hamilton Duffy: ...Used for data at rest. doesn't get into 
  data transport side of standards
Kim Hamilton Duffy: ...Has stayed connected with other data 
  initiatives. U.S. and non-U.S.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: ...Can pull in improvements from different 
  SDOs
Kim Hamilton Duffy: ...Can provide translations "rosetta stone"
Ceds.ed.gov
Jim Goodell:  For learner, wallet will need to support a range, 
  but for "issuers" there will be specific focuses. Work through 
  IEEE ILR happening will help [scribe assist by Kim Hamilton 
  Duffy]
Greg Nadeau:

Chris Houston: SOn got a competency-based report card (shown in 
  slide 2)
Chris Houston: SLide 3 shows JSON notation of the 
  competency-based report card assertion, would work inside the 
  assertion envelope we've been talking about
Chris Houston: Rubric-criterion labels and competencies are the 
  assertion
Simone Ravaoli:  Can I add you to the q to give us your 
  high-level thoughts on where similar work is happening in europe? 
  (We'd like to ask you to lead a dedicated call to discuss 
  in-depth later) [scribe assist by Kim Hamilton Duffy]
Chris Houston: Uses OB mechanism for email / hashing
Simone Ravaoli: Sure
Chris Houston: Associations used t place the assertion or the 
  related achievement on a graph
Greg Kidd:  There are some things I disagree with (how to 
  approach similar solutions) It will not take months....we are 
  working out differences
Nate Otto:  Evolution of the CLR - candidate public final 
  (available for public viewing) - no one has signed up to be a 
  consumer implementation of CLR yet, 2 publisher implementations
Nate Otto:  IMS leadership expressed some interest for 
  compatibility to W3C VC, but not yet clear what that means...
Nate Otto:  We should look at actual examples and code to see 
  that it can work
Simone Ravaoli:  CEN standard in EU then EC put financing into 
  some ERASMOS projects...
Simone Ravaoli:  Now EUROpass project EUROpass digital credential 
  ecosystem EDCI
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I think/hope some of the T3 innovation 
  network pilots will exercise the receiving side
Simone Ravaoli: Slight corrections on the scribe:  CEN (not CEN), 
   Erasmus+ (not Erasmos)... thanks so much Jim :-)
Kim Hamilton Duffy: (In addition to other POCs discussed)
Alex Jackl:  This problem of not having people receiving the data 
  is a problem across the ecosystem, receiving is the hardest part, 
  effort not to creat a wallet that can hold the different forms of 
  data... then people ready to accept that data ....
Simone Ravaoli: Thanks all
