<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="information">Brent: This is a topic that&apos;s near and dear to my heart. I drew inspiration for this work from Heather Flannagan. Some of these slides are hers. This  is a broader talk on standards. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="information">Brent: Standards don&apos;t come out fully formed, you have to be engaged early and often... if you get involved too late, difficult to change direction. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="information">Brent: First part of this conversation, which I&apos;d like conversation, jump in if you&apos;d like... as we go through development phase, talk about how process evolves, and will speak to how it works at W3C. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="information">Brent: At very beginning of standards dev lifecycle, we are in CGs at W3C... we are in BOF sessions at IETF... or you&apos;re hangingout at IIW thinking about interesting sessions... that then turns into hallway conversation... which then turns into something you want to work on. Ideas happen, cluster, like set of eggs layed by a butterfly, not every idea survives long term. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="information">Brent: It&apos;s a free form world where ideas are the realm of conversation... hard to quantify which ones become standards... impossible to express value of incubation... but it&apos;s invaluable if you want to have that sort of influence on what standards are created and where things go. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="information">Brent: After initial incubation... we get some legs... continues in W3C CGs... what should we work on ... adoption of work item in CG heralds something that&apos;s concrete enough. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="information">Brent: Participation ends up with something more refined... but at that stage, there is still a lot of conversation and lots of effort spent incubating... since conversation is still happening, influencing things at this stage is challenging... difficult to see where your incentives best fit w/ converstaions that are happening. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="information">Brent: After the legs of the work form, there is standards development and implementation... ideas are more set... there is refinement as implementations are created and noble ideas are being implemented in real world... there is some back and forth, but at this stage, difficult to see what the progress is. If you start with a spec and rip out half of it, is that progress? Sometimes yes, if quality of spec is improved. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="information">Brent: WG has refined specification, implementations provide feedback... back and forth can occur. Influencing spec at this stage requires higher level of investment...you need resources to implement. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="information">Brent: Participating as WG members can be expensive, but regardless of whether or not it&apos;s at W3C or elsewhere, it takes a lot of concentrated time. As the standard is adopted, as existing implementations beocme real worl ddeployments... it can take years... when WG has the thing done... it goes out into the world, but can still take years for things to implementers to engage w/ standard, compare it to other implementations, this is where there is <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="information">Brent: When VC v1.0 went out, we recognized that there were details that we handwaved around... we wanted the spec to be broad and implementable and experiment with it... this experimentation allowed us to come back in v2.0 to understand what we need to nail down in v2.0 (like the proof section) and any other extension points, if we are going to continue to support them, those need to be nailed down as well.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="information">Brent: At different standards organizations, these are roughly the timelines... ISO, OIDF, W3C, IETF -- different stages, preparation of document, each path is different, but all end up in a similar place... you end up w/ a final specification, W3C calls them Recommendations, IETF says Internet Standards... each SDO has their paths to follow to get to the final thing. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="information">Brent: Looking specifically at W3C -- W3C has a process document, this is the official guide for developing recommendations at W3C... recommendations started long before a WG is started... most of stuff in VCWG began in CCG here (many years ago), grateful for that incubation. <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="information">Brent: Not all publications are standards at W3C...
