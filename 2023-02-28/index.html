<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Kind of a gatekeeping exercise some people didn&apos;t like the fact that the editors had so much say about what gets into the registry or not in so this is kind of our second attempt at making it a bit more quote-unquote fair to get into these Registries basically if you are extending the verifiable credential specification in any way we want to be able to kind of point to your specification whether it&apos;s at in a w3c. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   In any group or differ. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Or ITF or whatever you should be able to at least list your specification there so that&apos;s the first item just be aware that that conversations going on right now around how to make process of registering specifications that extend the core data model more fair and easy the second item do you want me to go into as well it&apos;s the it&apos;s the test suite for verifiable credentials 20 or like do you want to pick that up at. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Even great thanks and I&apos;ll just do a quick screen share so the idea here is that the verifiable credentials version 20 specification is going to be going into candidate recommendation probably sometime during the summer one of the things we want to be sure that we have kind of lined up is a good test suite for that. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  A good idea to do that and so this proposed work item is a test suite for the verifiable credentials 20 data model right now it&apos;s partially complete we are looking for other supporters from other organizations basically this is a you know it&apos;s a we need it we need something that tests the the specification and we&apos;re trying to learn from the version 11 data model tests. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Something that has tests that are more repeatable so that we can run tests on a regular basis like a weekly basis against the the specification to make sure that we can write new tests and understand how the ecosystem is going to do with that new test before like publishing it and getting a whole bunch of hate mail that implemented a test that you know breaks the ecosystem and so and so forth so we&apos;re trying to do a better job this time around with the more you know see I see. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
