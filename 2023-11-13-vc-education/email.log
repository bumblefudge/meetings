<kerri_lemoie> Is there anyone speaking right now? Wondering if I 
  have audio issues.
Kerri Lemoie: :Slightly_smiling_face:
<charles_e._lehner> i am also wondering that
<dmitri_zagidulin> (so now Simone is actually speaking, so if you 
  can't hear, try another browser etc)
<kerri_lemoie> I can hear him now
Sheela_Kiiskilä: Gina I came in and he had a code to give a 
  presentation on a Pepsi and completely disappeared because it's 
  at 6 p.m. our time on the usually I'm cooking and I forget today 
  I remember to come so I thought I'd say hello.
Sheela_Kiiskilä: I do try to be got to come for all as many 
  meetings as possible from now.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh no problem I was curious about what you 
  meant by Seal is it is it a digital signature are you using any 
  of the verifiable credential variance either JWT or debased so 
  I'm just not familiar with this notation thanks.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Simone - sadly the transcriber doesn't seem 
  to be hearing Ildiko
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks what's the difference between proven by 
  and evidence.
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> there might be more info on e-Seal 
  and its use here: 
  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSIDOC/E-signing+and+e-sealing+Verifiable+Credentials+and+Verifiable+Presentations
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I see and so and what's so that's an example 
  of supporting information for the claim so what is evidence used 
  for them.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I think that's very interesting so part of the 
  reason that that I'm asking about evidence is that in the current 
  verifiable credentials 2.0 working group there is an ongoing 
  argument about what exactly is evidence for.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And usually it's used for things that the two 
  properties that your you've shown in has claimed the proven by an 
  influence specifically proven by but the the use case that you're 
  using evidence for linking to I guess that I could have tation 
  artifacts or something that's that's a new usage that we should 
  bring to the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Group so as I.
<dmitri_zagidulin> very cool, this is similar to the VC WG's 
  'renderMethod' proposal
<tallted> ccgbot, pointer?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks I'm feeling self-conscious that I'm the 
  only one asking questions but my question is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Can you tell us a little more about how the 
  ìitís standards are created but I'm noticing a lack of 
  conversation between the yeah itís schemas and either w3c's web 
  control group or the new verifiable credential groups that ITF 
  and so I'm just wondering like to those of us not familiar with 
  the itís format are how how did the specs.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   I created are there public meeting.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is the repository for the specifications 
  thanks.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Wait wait the the question is not about the 
  seals it's more about what's the general process of creating this 
  ei2 specification.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The design makes sense the question makes.

<kerri_lemoie> Thanks for sharing that @Ildiko
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> This is another resource for eIDAS 
  and VC 
  https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_supported_ssi_may_2019_0.pdf
https://www.eciu.eu/
Sheela_Kiiskilä: I'm not sure I'm the person who was supposed to 
  be on the spot but from a CIO University we are at a university 
  and another partner they do FC and that's what the presentation 
  we gave last year we also did an early adapter program with 
  European digital credentials and if you ask for a Venn diagram I 
  would.
https://europa.eu/europass/elm-browser/index.html
Sheela_Kiiskilä: Data model is the common part in both of them 
  both of them use the same data model so it's easy to think about 
  interoperability but when it comes to the other Technologies like 
  blockchain versus this and we even when we were doing the FC 
  early adopter program on the first feedback we sent out to them 
  is that for our diplomats this might work but if we are issuing 
  Mike.
Sheela_Kiiskilä: Um you know verifiable credentials for short 
  learning experiences or things like that this won't work because 
  every time expecting the student to request a credential is not 
  going to work students forget and at the end of it when they 
  needed they will remember and it is it's just not the minute they 
  finish just traditionally everybody got used to when they finish 
  something they get the credential to into their hands.
Sheela_Kiiskilä:  whether it's.
Sheela_Kiiskilä: It's a PDF whether it's an email or anything so 
  I think that that model works and it has to be that so till that 
  changes at least four micro credentials if C is going to be a 
  harder sell and also there were other issues as well I actually 
  wrote a paper on this on a PC and Adoption of a Pepsi one of the 
  things is because it requires a node every every if.
Sheela_Kiiskilä:  is institution that's.
Sheela_Kiiskilä: To use it they needs to be a or at least they're 
  recommended to have a node within that country because you do 
  need multiple notes to work in the blockchain which requires it 
  basically a national strategy to to install a node and maintain 
  the node and there are GDP are issues you have to take care of at 
  the node itself as well so it is a it is a university or 
  institution cannot.
Sheela_Kiiskilä:  not just decide saying okay I'm going to use 
  Ipsy it.
Sheela_Kiiskilä: More planning and a lot more entities involved 
  before it can happen but with the European digital credentials 
  you know it's it's it's a platform we are all very familiar with 
  the platforms and right now you see I University decided to use 
  European digital credentials and it is a platform to issue micro 
  credentials.
Sheela_Kiiskilä: You're definitely different different use cases 
  for both of them for like I said for diplomas you know students 
  might not mind requesting for it but for micro credentials it 
  would be hard to sell.

Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks Sam my question is for ildiko about 
  the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Micro credentials and students requesting them 
  what about the push workflow that the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Either email notifications or the credentials 
  themselves would automatically be sent to students at the end of 
  the class I guess my question is why the emphasis on the pole 
  method students requesting and not just hey the credentials are 
  available to them.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Make sense so why doesn't that apply to my 
  credentials.
<sheela_kiiskilä> Espciallly all higher education institutions 
  will be interested in using accreditation. Most of the European 
  universities already are in DEQAR.
https://www.eqar.eu/
https://www.eqar.eu/qa-results/search/
Sheela_Kiiskilä: So every as far as I know most of the European 
  universities are part of this egg they car or a car the car is 
  database of a car every country has the quality assurance 
  education Ministry that goes through all the universities within 
  the within the country and assess the quality and everything and 
  then they submit this report to.
Sheela_Kiiskilä:  to the acre.
<ildiko_mazar> FYI, currently there are 92 034 reports available 
  on 3 856 institutions in the DEQAR database.
Sheela_Kiiskilä: Make sure that you know all the universities 
  within a country or following the European quality standards this 
  year I actually happen to be one of the people giving the review 
  for our own University for the for the country and I was asking 
  them how long does it take to get this report to a car and they 
  said they are going to combine all the universities and it takes 
  about 3 months to send it to a car and I already see that it's 
  updated.
Sheela_Kiiskilä:  because our.
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> DEQAR piloted using VC  - 
  https://www.eqar.eu/launch-of-verifiable-credentials-in-deqar/
Sheela_Kiiskilä: Two universities got combined into one before 
  last year both of them were there separately and I was getting 
  worried that when we issue micro credentials I need that to be 
  one University so that you know we can use from Dakar directly 
  into the micro credential and that's a that's every two years or 
  every three years every country goes through this quality 
  assurance process and then make sure that it are.
Sheela_Kiiskilä:  those the European standards.
<ildiko_mazar> Indeed.
<ildiko_mazar> Which is why this forum is so crucial, and I feel 
  honoured to have been given so much time, space and attention to 
  give a little insight.
<dmitri_zagidulin> thank you so much, Ildiko!
<ildiko_mazar> It's been a great pleasure.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sure for will thank you thank you so much for 
  giving summary of the topic so yeah the tldr we're going to be 
  holding elections shortly so we're going to be doing a call on 
  the mailing list for nominations for candidates who want to be a 
  CO chair too.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Tell us about.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Men will hold a rank dress election that's it 
  so start thinking about it so I'm thinking we want to nominate if 
  you're interested in being a co-chair please reach out to us on 
  the list or directly through email and we'll walk you through the 
  process thanks.
<ildiko_mazar> <3
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks all!
<sheela_kiiskilä> thank you
<cel> 👏
