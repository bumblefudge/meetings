<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Off and that is specifically around this concept of workload identity and and what that actually means so let&apos;s start with a really basic question what is a workload well one definition that I think fits really well is that it is a single piece of software deployed with a specific configuration for a single purpose so when you&apos;ve got a piece of software that does exactly. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:   One thing. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Is that thing and you have it configured to only do that thing that&apos;s the type of thing that we&apos;re talking about for a workload so say that it is a assigning service it takes in the document it applies the signature and Returns the result right or on the other end a validation service that takes in a signed document manages pulling the keys validating the signature and Returns the result back to the system. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:   One of the important. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Things about workload especially today though is that you can have many many copies of these things are notion of what a computer is and what a server is today is pretty different from what it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago and one of the key differentiations for this notion of what a workload is as opposed to what we might traditionally consider just a service or a server is that. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  The whole idea with the workload is that they are repeatable that you can spin up a bunch of these and because they do a single thing you can make lots of copies when you need them get rid of the copies when you don&apos;t need them. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  So fundamentally that&apos;s what we&apos;re talking about for work gloves. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  So what does this have to do with identity we&apos;ve got software it&apos;s running it&apos;s doing things that should be good enough. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Let&apos;s say we&apos;ve actually got three different cloud services. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Is comprised comprised different workloads in the system when we spend these up we want to know which one is which and we want to know things like how do we get. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  These in secrets into these systems I want to be able to tell the difference between the orange system the yellow system the green system. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Basically the way that it works is that you run an agent in your environment where all of your workloads are running and when your workload wakes up the first time it calls the spiffy agent and says like hey here I am who am I. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Workloads are not pre-configured to really know their own identity they don&apos;t get pre-configured with a secret that lets them call this agent and then that gets them the right identity because then you have to answer the question well how do you get that secret into the system in the first place spiffy is really clever in how it stands up because when these agents make this query it can do all of this it can create. <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Is it can generate certificates and Trust roots and keys and provision out the right ones to each of these systems. <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-53').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-53').show()" id="53" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  By basically looking at the environment of the workload itself so it takes a look at the workload and it can do all sorts of things like you know which kubernetes node is this running on which you know what&apos;s the hash of the software that&apos;s running on this image you know whether it&apos;s Docker image layers or what have you you know what is the what is the runtime footprint look like of. <a id="link-53" style="display:none;" href="#53">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-54').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-54').show()" id="54" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:   This there&apos;s all these things that we can look at. <a id="link-54" style="display:none;" href="#54">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-55').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-55').show()" id="55" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Software to know that only certain things are supposed to be running in this place at a given time and so when we see all of those that&apos;s how we know which piece of software it is. <a id="link-55" style="display:none;" href="#55">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-56').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-56').show()" id="56" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  And like I mentioned this with the agent allows us to hand out the right keys to the right agents so we can now hand things like certificates and tokens and whatnot to for example the orange service that only the orange service gets and only things that look like the orange service gets so if I have thousands of copies of that orange service then they&apos;re all going to get the right keys so that they can do orange service kinds of things. <a id="link-56" style="display:none;" href="#56">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-57').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-57').show()" id="57" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:   What do I mean by that well let&apos;s say. <a id="link-57" style="display:none;" href="#57">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-58').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-58').show()" id="58" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Actually bundling our services together so the orange service needs to call the Yellow service which needs to call the green service. <a id="link-58" style="display:none;" href="#58">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-59').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-59').show()" id="59" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  Is really one of the core things that spiffy solves because each of these has their own identity and it&apos;s paired with cryptographic material the yellow service when it gets this call it knows that the orange service is making that call and likewise the green service knows that the yellow service is making that call and we can do this using Mutual TLS we can do this with there&apos;s current work to do a center constraint profile token profile. <a id="link-59" style="display:none;" href="#59">✪</a></div>
