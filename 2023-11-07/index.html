<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  As we already have quite a few implementers for the specification it did not change that drastically since 2015 or so so that let&apos;s see yeah that that specifications out there right now will be kind of collecting implementations through the end of q1 I&apos;m next year and then we&apos;ll be proceeding that specification to kind of a global standard at that. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  It&apos;s been in the making for 8 years now I guess it should really probably closer to 11 years as when the work started but nearing the end which is great to see the other heads up is that we were scheduled to do the candidate recommendations for the verifiable credential data Integrity specifications today but due to workload issues. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Shove it into an. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Elope as it stands and then digitally sign that the problem well one of the one of the issues with doing that is that sometimes depending on the type of envelope you stuff the verifiable credential into all of a sudden you can&apos;t see any of the data you can&apos;t work with it you know like a put it in a database and all that kind of stuff so canonicalization is basically used to take a verifiable credential as you see it and then transform it into something that. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   You can digitally sign in a way that is. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In a way that kind of signs the meaning of the credential instead of just signing what the credential looks like so there&apos;s a difference between signing the B which obscures what the credential you know it obscures the credentialing can&apos;t see it anymore versus signing the information associated with the verifiable credential so. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  A high level is it unfortunately this stuff is like super low level cryptography stuff but fundamentally rdf data set canonicalization is an attempt to sign the information that goes along with the verifiable credential so that you can put that verifiable credential in a lot of different places without there being issues with it like like for example if you just sign the B. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Adding a. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Single white space into the verifiable credential will destroy the signature and that&apos;s a problem when people go and lay copy and paste this stuff and put it in web pages like they do for like manat org and SEO optimization and you know doing things like listing store hours and products and stuff like that so rdf data set canonicalization allows you to basically make the data in the verifiable credential more resilient and digitally sign it at the same time. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Really that was helpful it&apos;s hard to it&apos;s hard to. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
