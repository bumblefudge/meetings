Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Manu Sporny:  All right welcome everyone to the August 30th 2020 
  to VC API call. I will put our agenda into chat here and there on 
  the agenda today we will review the doodle poll the new time we 
  also have introduction.
Manu Sporny:  Updates in today's basically talking about the VC 
  API so the verifiable credentials API.
Manu Sporny:  In the goals design the the status of the suite in 
  the roadmap and then just a general discussion on what people 
  would like to see differently you know happening there and then 
  we might end early or we might try and process some issues so we 
  all take that as as it comes any other updates or changes to the 
  agenda before we get started.
Manu Sporny:  Okay if not let's go ahead and jump into it.

Topic: Introductions, Relevant Community Updates

Manu Sporny:  Introductions relevant Community updates I think we 
  all know each other here is there anyone that would like to 
  introduce or reintroduce themselves.
Manu Sporny:  Okay any Community updates relevant Community 
  updates.
Manu Sporny:  Go ahead Patrick.
Patrick St-Louis:  Yeah I just wanted to mention that tomorrow 
  there's an entire of patent presented by in d.c. oh in the hyper 
  Ledger areas space and as we're going to be hosting a room 
  helping people sort of Test Mobile Wallet application so how to 
  use the area's agent test harness to test Mobile Wallet 
  application and there is a small component about verifiable 
  credential in this so.
Patrick St-Louis:   I thought it would be interesting to mention.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah interesting do you have a link to that that we 
  could put in the minutes to share with the people.
Patrick St-Louis:  I will definitely share link during the 
  meeting I just need to go find it in my emails yeah.
Manu Sporny:  Okay great thank you in Patrick would you mind 
  giving us kind of an idea of like what are the goals of this 
  particular interop Athan interop Fest.
Patrick St-Louis:  So it's the second interpret on that in this 
  year's hosting the Austin won in the past there's a few goals so 
  at the moment a big conversation and the hyper Ledger in the area 
  space is out of bound connections between agents and there is a 
  move towards a IP version 2 so AI peas are sort of what defines.
Patrick St-Louis:  Concepts and Airy space and migrating to this 
  new VIP allows for more features to be present so it's a way for 
  vendors and organization to come together and see if they're 
  updated applications can talk to one another so they will be like 
  an infrastructure in place they will simulate a scenario with 
  laboratory offering test results this is going to be a holder 
  agents.
Patrick St-Louis:   Verify agents and it's just basically.
Patrick St-Louis:  Showing up and testing specific rfc's to see 
  if they can communicate in between every agents there's for more 
  details I'll give a I can definitely post the links for more 
  details about specifically which rfc's are the main focus of the 
  event but it's mostly for the community to come together and test 
  their limitations.
Manu Sporny:  Excellent thank you Patrick and yeah looking 
  forward to that link as well any other relevant Community 
  updates.
Patrick St-Louis: 
  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Interoperability+Event
Manu Sporny:  Okay some of the community updates will cover 
  during the test Suite goals design roadmap B the only thing that 
  may be relevant to some people here working with verifiable 
  credentials let me share my screen in this is a super rough demo 
  playground no Jason they'll be so the Jason.
Manu Sporny:   Aldi playground.
Manu Sporny:  Um has been upgraded to support safe mode in 
  json-ld J so one of the things when you're creating a verifiable 
  credential that most json-ld processors used to do was that they 
  would silently drop information that didn't have a term 
  definition in signed the stuff that that didn't happen and that's 
  been a couple of people over the years and so we've introduced at 
  least in one of the.
Manu Sporny:  Mode that will warn you when you're trying to use 
  something that doesn't have a that doesn't have a term defined so 
  if I go to the options here and see the safe mode here it's set 
  to default I forget what the default is but if we set safe mode 
  to True which was what we would expect to be set for most 
  verifiable credential libraries.
<dave_longley> the default is "true" for canonicalization
Manu Sporny:  Forget if the activity streams context has a.
<dave_longley> (for safe mode)
Manu Sporny:  Hey vocab setting through well we'll see or yeah it 
  does what give me let me use a different example here not 
  schema.org this one if we add an undefined property in here like 
  Foo bar in the json-ld processor detects that it's going to drop 
  a property it will now throw an error so this is very programme.
Manu Sporny:  You know you.
Manu Sporny:  Exposed in this way in the signing libraries but we 
  actually do detect it in throw a warning stating that this is an 
  invalid property in stating that you know it's going to drop the 
  property go ahead Dave.
Dave Longley:  Yeah just want to make a quick comment that when 
  you use the canonized tab on the playground the default for safe 
  mode is true and canonized as what ends up getting used in 
  signatures so that with the latest version of the library that 
  fails it fails what does what's called failing closed it defaults 
  to safe mode by true setting that to true so you'd have to turn 
  that off if you wanted to allow unsafe values.
Manu Sporny:  So in theory if I do food this it's going to throw 
  an error safe mode validation error.
Dave Longley:  The other thing to note here is that we'll also 
  catch relative URLs so if if you're using relative URLs in your 
  data and you don't have any mapping back to the vocab or at base 
  and you have a relative URL that will also catch those errors so 
  one of the most common mistakes people make is they they put at 
  type or type if they have an alias and they put a value in there 
  that doesn't actually map.
Dave Longley:   Up to anything and so.
Dave Longley:  You can see that at that are happening and you 
  know you the same thing would happen if you put a capital f for 
  Foo and no / because it attempts to yeah that when you do that 
  I'm json-ld it attempts to make it a full URL but since safe mode 
  will catch that for you now and throw an error.
Manu Sporny:  Well in any case if this doesn't make any sense to 
  you it may not affect you but if it does make sense to you you we 
  are trying to protect developers from accidentally signing data 
  that they they think they're signing when they're really not okay 
  so that's json-ld safe mode will make an announcement on that 
  about that on the mailing list later this week.
Manu Sporny:   Any other.
Manu Sporny:  Announcements relevant Community updates.

Topic: Possible New Time For VC API Calls?

Manu Sporny: https://doodle.com/meeting/organize/id/bkZ86z5a
Manu Sporny:  Okay next up is possible new time for me see API 
  calls question mark we have a dual Pol out because the number of 
  people have said that they've wanted to come to this meeting but 
  it's a bad time so we sent out a pole and we've gotten a lot of 
  responses so far which is great the not sag.
Manu Sporny:  Part of it is there.
Manu Sporny:  UPS in everyone's schedule and it's not clear how 
  many of these people are actually going to be able to show up.
Manu Sporny:  We have some good kind of times so I think what 
  we're going to try and do because you know no no time choosing 
  processes is completely Fair we're probably going to optimize for 
  implementers to get as many implementers on this call as possible 
  implementers and potential implementers so they will get first 
  priority and then second priority is potentially implementers and 
  in all other people right so we're trying to just get as many 
  people on these calls has as we can.
Manu Sporny:   We do have some times that are looking pretty.
Manu Sporny:  It's read 3 to 4 p.m. so an hour before this time 
  maybe in any case go ahead and get your you know thoughts in on 
  their understanding that it's just really hard to find good times 
  for everyone any questions on the new time or any of that.
Manu Sporny:  The other heads up I think associated with the time 
  is this month sorry in September it's going to be a heavy 
  conference season for everyone and travel season for everyone w3c 
  TPAC is the second week of September we will probably cancel this 
  call during the second week and then rebooting the web of trust 
  is the last week in September and so we will probably cancel this 
  call.
Manu Sporny:   All then as well because a number of us are going 
  to be.
Manu Sporny:  Okay anything else on scheduling timing any of that 
  stuff.
Manu Sporny:  Oh it's it's well it's Eastern Standard but I think 
  you can set your doodle preferences so it'll put it in your local 
  time time zone.
Manu Sporny:  Okay yeah it's it's yeah unfortunately looked it's 
  complicated right yeah it's not it's not supposed to be in any 
  particular time zone people are just supposed to pick it 
  typically what we've noticed over the past 15-20 years is that 
  you either have a lot of asia-pacific folks in a meeting like the 
  internet of things and web of things stuff and then you tend to 
  have it in in daytime.
Manu Sporny:   I'm in Asia Pacific region.
Manu Sporny:  Or you end up having something that's pretty 
  heavily focused Western world's so it's East Coast 10 a.m. 11 
  a.m. so year up in the u.s. meats and there is very rarely a time 
  that you know well it's just not a time that works for everyone 
  on the in the globe so we'll do our best we I think we optimized 
  to try and make sure that you know matter could participate in 
  these calls in we're going to you know.
Manu Sporny:   Continue to see if we can we can do that.
Manu Sporny:  The problem okay anything else on the times before 
  we move on.

Topic: VC API Test Suite Goals

Manu Sporny:  Okay next up is BC API test Suite goals.
Manu Sporny:  I'm going to I'm going to start off please other 
  people join in because this is supposed to be the people's test 
  Suite right our Collective test suite and so if you feel like 
  some of the goals are misguided or they should be changed or any 
  part of this you know please queue up and speak up so that we can 
  figure out if there's a way for us to be inclusive about those 
  requirements so I'm going to basically.
Manu Sporny:  What's been driving the test Suite the VC API test 
  Suite one that this groups working on to date and then you know 
  we can maybe can compare contrast with traceability test suite 
  and then and then go from there okay so.
Manu Sporny:   The first.
Manu Sporny: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api-test-suite-implementations#usage
Manu Sporny:  Link here we go ahead and put this in here in the 
  chat channel one of the things that we're trying to do is just 
  make it make it possible to test the VC API and the surrounding 
  ecosystem in a modular way so basically we're trying to separate 
  like the issuing test the things that just test the issuing end.
Manu Sporny:   Point in the options that you can set.
Manu Sporny:  Endpoint we're trying to test those in isolation 
  right as one of the modular test Suites.
Manu Sporny:  Another modular test Suite would for example test 
  of very specific crypto sweet so like the Json web signature 
  stuff or the BBS plus stuff or ecdsa or ed2 55:19 signature 2020 
  those are examples of modular test Suites that just test one 
  crypto sweet then we have modular feature test Suites so things 
  like credential refresh.
Manu Sporny:  Artists list 2021 things that basically test a 
  specific spec right a specific you know thing in the goal here or 
  at least the vision with this set of test Suites is that if we 
  get enough test Suites together we will be able to put together 
  some sort of interactive interoperability dashboard so something 
  that looks like can I use.com so if I go to like.
Manu Sporny:   Like you know this thing.
Manu Sporny:  This is a wrap up of just like thousands of tests 
  that are run for a specific feature for browsers so this cannot 
  use.com is something that web developers use to figure out if 
  it's safe to use a particular feature or not will it be if I use 
  this feature in my web page will it be supported across all the 
  browsers so what we're trying to do is we're trying to build this 
  kind of thing for the ecosystem driven off of the VCA.
Manu Sporny:  So what you can see here is Through Time different 
  versions have different levels of support like for ecmascript 
  2015 yes 6 Chrome versions for through 20 didn't supported and 
  then there was partial support from verses 21 through 50 and then 
  finally at version 51 through 100 3 it got you know really good 
  support with little notes like so it doesn't support tail call 
  right this little to here that's probably you can't see.
Manu Sporny:   See but they're notes here for you know how 
  things.
Manu Sporny:  These sorts of things help developers figure out 
  what they can Implement in they also can help executive teams 
  figure out what kind of product you know roadmap things they 
  should they should contemplate you know has the as the years roll 
  on Patrick go ahead.
Patrick St-Louis:  My question around for here we have a case you 
  want to test an implementation against feature specification is 
  there a concept about how to test an implementation against 
  another implementation on the line let's say a company a has an 
  issuer and Company B has holder company says a verifier are you 
  just going to take for granted that.
Patrick St-Louis:   That since they all.
Patrick St-Louis:  Towards the specific features they should be 
  interpretable with one another or do you consider down the line 
  having a sort of a flow driven test had added to these sweets 
  with one implementation against another.
Manu Sporny:  That is an excellent question in I'm going to 
  fast-forward really quickly and I haven't even looked at this 
  part of the test Suite well no we don't do it there we do it 
  somewhere yes the the short answer is yes there will be an N by n 
  Matrix of one issuer calling another verifier to verify right in 
  that's one of the things that the traceability folks are focusing 
  on right now which is can you do workflows full full workflows so 
  the short answer.
Manu Sporny:   ER is yes we are contemplating.
Manu Sporny:  For example the very simplest first workflow is 
  something like did auth so did authentications defined in the in 
  the BPA BPA R-Spec we will end up having a test Suite very 
  shortly that does that did our thing and then the next thing is 
  like okay well can you did off and then can they can the the 
  issuer ask for a credential you deliver the credential and then 
  they ask for another credential and you delivered that and then 
  finally they give you the final verifiable.
Manu Sporny:   Credential so yes absolutely you know workflow.
Manu Sporny:  Exchange flows are contemplated in the future.
Patrick St-Louis:  Okay interesting are you familiar with the 
  area Center probability information page.
Patrick St-Louis: https://aries-interop.info/
Manu Sporny:  Not no not deeply so if you could provide that that 
  would be.
Manu Sporny:  Let It Go.
Patrick St-Louis:  It can give a rough idea so it's a sort of 
  Matrix towards all the different implementation so they respond 
  different agents you know and then they test each agents against 
  one another for given rfc's and at the end they give like a 
  compatibility Matrix of different features and then if you go on 
  the left you have each implementation on their own.
Patrick St-Louis:  Areas like there's the pet python.
Patrick St-Louis:  I work you know there's more popular ones and 
  then you can dive into the details a lot deeper but I'm assuming 
  is something a bit similar to that to you you want to do or.
Manu Sporny:  Maybe I don't know if it's someone with more of a 
  familiarity with the Aries interop you know thing can look at it 
  at a high level I'm looking at this and I'm not seeing features 
  tested individually but maybe that's.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah so these are workflows being tested not 
  necessarily features like jewelry first.
Patrick St-Louis:  Yeah this is very much one implementation 
  playing a specific role in the interaction.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah can you're saying this is the interrupt Matrix 
  like occupy against Occupy and if J against find e for example.
Patrick St-Louis:  Yeah and it's so they're based on the.
Patrick St-Louis: https://allure.vonx.io/
Patrick St-Louis:  One second here so if you have a look so the 
  user as a reporter its Allure of reporter so when they run the 
  test the use this other reporter in this submit the results at 
  this endpoint there and if you click on the left you can find all 
  these these projects and how they generate that Matrix page is 
  the query the API of this sort of yeah yeah.
Patrick St-Louis:   Just need to click on the.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah here we go.
Patrick St-Louis:  Hold on a second.
Manu Sporny:  Here we go.
Patrick St-Louis:  So at the end of this sort of query so this 
  sort of Allure of Docker service there's an API available that 
  you can go query the results of every project and it's they have 
  like sort of script that goes query certain and points and that's 
  how they generate the interrupt page so the here it's a bit more 
  in detail I see in your Suite.
Patrick St-Louis:  I'd like a custom reporter like.
Patrick St-Louis:  You see a proprietary reporter.
Manu Sporny:  Yes that's one of the ways it can be rendered and 
  we'll get to that here in a little bit and looking look at how 
  that's done.
Manu Sporny:  Okay but this is very very helpful so I think one 
  of the differences I'm seeing here is that it's not clear which 
  features are being tested and which parts of each sex being 
  tested in which you know specific a IP is being supported other 
  than the whole AIP right yep yeah yeah yeah so so this is good I 
  mean we can we can look at this and compare contrast and figure 
  out you know what's missing.
Manu Sporny:   Missing from the VC API test.
Manu Sporny:  Useful to have you know there as well.
Manu Sporny:  Okay back to the goals though that's I think this 
  is kind of where we want to end up with the ability to drill down 
  so some variation of the area's interrupt test and the can I 
  use.com site and in and the ability to really drill down into 
  very specific test to see where exactly you're failing and where 
  you're passing and things of that nature.
Manu Sporny:   Any questions on the go.
Manu Sporny:  Or does anyone else want to speak to other goals we 
  might want to have.
Manu Sporny:  Go ahead bad.
Patrick St-Louis:  Sorry I have another question do you intend 
  these test Suites to be available as tools for individual to test 
  their only application where it's more to offer sort of represent 
  Erie about current implementation and their status.
Manu Sporny:  Oh I don't know if I understand the question.
Patrick St-Louis:  Because right now like when I go into test 
  Suite I can run the test suite and it's going to copy the VC API 
  implementation repo and run the test against all those 
  implementation but what if I'm an individual and I want to use 
  this this sweet and preparation of some assessment was that the 
  intended purpose of this test Suites okay.
Manu Sporny:  You can absolutely do that like we have people that 
  download and run these tests by themselves on their own software 
  or other people software one of the things we were trying to do 
  is just not require people to have to do that this this these 
  test Suites run on a weekly basis and we're probably going to 
  ratchet them down to run on a nightly basis so you will be able 
  to see whether or not certain implementers you know support.
Manu Sporny:  On a day-by-day basis.
Manu Sporny:  So you can use that you can use the test Suites and 
  Target your own systems with them like if you have an internal 
  system and you don't want to make it publicly known that you have 
  an internal system you can use it to test the internal systems 
  but what we're really trying to do is generate visibility for 
  people that need to use these systems to see which vendors are 
  compliant and which ones are not effectively.
Patrick St-Louis:  Okay so it's sort of like a to say French we 
  say a deacon Technologic like a showcase for available in 
  transition.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah that's right yep just like this is you know 
  that for web browsers so you have all the web browser kind of 
  vendors up at the top and then you can see you know how many of 
  them support es6 for example right and they're you know they're 
  thousands of features that are covered here like how many of them 
  support web transport right we can see that web transport isn't 
  doing that great right now except in Chrome and.
Manu Sporny:   Opera and Edge.
Manu Sporny:  So now it's not the time to you know put web 
  transport into production for example.
Manu Sporny:  Okay any other questions concerns about the goals 
  before we look into kind of how it's designed.
Manu Sporny:  All right so real quick you see API test Suite 
  design.

Topic: VC API Test Suite Design

Manu Sporny: 
  https://github.com/digitalbazaar/mocha-w3c-interop-reporter
Manu Sporny:  And I'll put these two links into the chat 
  fundamentally.
Manu Sporny:  What we trying to also do is create something that 
  can be used in the working groups in like the verifiable 
  credentials working group and in well yeah the in the VC working 
  group we've got the 20 were coming up and it is a requirement w3c 
  that you test every normative feature in the specification to 
  exit to get to a global standard in so at some point we're going 
  to have to write tests for the new.
Manu Sporny:   Data model the new data Integrity stuff.
Manu Sporny:  And that can be a very time-consuming and expensive 
  process and so if we have something in place that allows us to 
  test those things well before we need to go to Canada Trek or 
  recommendation at w3c the better off we are right we can we can 
  start demonstrating that these things that we're talking about in 
  the working group are actually implemented multiple people 
  support them the way you achieve that.
Manu Sporny:   Is you tend to you generate.
Manu Sporny:  And let me use an example here we see API it sure 
  well I wonder if we have the VC test Suite in the past this was 
  for verifiable credentials 10 we end up generating something that 
  looks like this right so we take every single normative statement 
  in the specification and we test it for a positive test and a 
  negative test to make sure that people have actually implemented 
  the specification so this.
Manu Sporny:   Is test on the.
Manu Sporny:  Patience so we test the basic document features and 
  then we test the credential status features and then we test link 
  data proves and credential scheme and so on and so forth right 
  the problem with this of course is that we ran this test suite at 
  the very end of the working group this is from 30th October 20 21 
  and we never really ran it after that was so so you don't 
  actually know what people are how they do today unless you go and 
  you run.
Manu Sporny:   The test Suite your.
Manu Sporny:  One of the things with the design of the tests we 
  did is we wanted to be able to run it on a nightly basis against 
  systems that people were claiming our their latest you know 
  greatest you know QA version at the at the at the very least 
  Patrick please.
Patrick St-Louis:  Is this this sweet still relevant the VC data 
  model test Suite or is it slowly moving away to the VC API.
Manu Sporny:  That's an excellent question I would argue in this 
  is debatable that it's not relevant anymore because we haven't 
  run it in a year and a half we could run it again but we would 
  never be able to get the type of coverage we're starting to see 
  with the VC API so I think you know what what what some of us are 
  going to propose at the upcoming w3c TPAC meeting is that we use 
  the VC API to run the tests so we.
Manu Sporny:   I will create a feature specific test suite for.
Manu Sporny:  Verifiable credential data model that will run 
  these tests so we'll run the same tests but the mechanism will 
  use to run the test is not asking each developer to run it on 
  their machine generated Json file upload the Json file we will 
  just basically say put up an endpoint that we can call on a 
  nightly weekly basis and it will run all of these tests against 
  the credential that you're issuing to make sure that you are a 
  showing a valid verifiable.
Manu Sporny:  Answer your question.
Patrick St-Louis:  Okay unfortunately yes.
Manu Sporny:  You can still run this and it should still work but 
  because we're working going into verifiable credential 20 data 
  models face it'll be it'll have to be revised you can still look 
  so go ahead.
Patrick St-Louis:  It's a no it's just like I said the lab like 
  we have clients coming in and you know they want to be not 
  certified but they want to have like some sort of stamp than are 
  compliant with this standard and that standard so we looked 
  around what test Suites are available so let's say we have a 
  client engagement and they want to be like sort of WT CE 
  certified without going public just yet for example so the moment 
  we sort of look at which test Suites are available and then we 
  run the.
Patrick St-Louis:  As we give them a report we say yeah it looks 
  good so.
Patrick St-Louis:  You see like running this.
Patrick St-Louis:  Test does it have some sort of validity in the 
  market.
Manu Sporny:  When I say that I say that having been being the 
  person that wrote a good chunk of the test Suite.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah so you know you can and you can get a gut 
  reaction like if you have all kinds of red x's on your 
  implementation there's a problem there but no I think we need an 
  updated test Suite which is why we are suggesting let's let's use 
  the verifiable credential API because it gives us repeatability 
  and then the only thing that needs to be done is the just these 
  tests need to be ported over which are is being done right now 
  right so I'd say.
Manu Sporny:  About another four months we'll have something 
  where you could run it against a certain infrastructure and get a 
  good idea on whether or not their conformant.
Manu Sporny:  So it's coming if the working group agrees with the 
  direction right yep and if they don't it's someone's going to 
  have to propose something better okay so so we have this own the 
  reason I went here is w3c expects these reports to be generated 
  in a certain fashion but clearly this is not the only way that 
  you can report how a test Suites.
Manu Sporny:   Doing the move.
Manu Sporny:  Reporter like this is another way right that Aries 
  is providing this is yet another way of showing how the tests are 
  running so they're different rendering things what we're trying 
  to do is get the test Suites to get into a system where we can 
  spit out data and then the data can be processed by test Suite 
  result renders of which there are many so that's another part of 
  this is this is one such rendering but it's not the only 
  rendering.
Manu Sporny:   And should not be the only rendering the test 
  Suite.
Patrick St-Louis:  Yeah if you showed a lot of page again and you 
  just click on the sweets show all.
Patrick St-Louis:  Right there yeah so there you get a bit more 
  details about specific so I think this gets more into.
Manu Sporny:  Yep yeah and then the difference here I think is 
  that I don't know if these are actually tied back to the 
  specification with w3c you're required to test the normative 
  statements that's what tells you whether or not it's a it's an 
  approved by the working group test or not do you know how that's 
  here work or these directly from specifications or is this like 
  someone decided that this is a good test.
Patrick St-Louis: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs
Patrick St-Louis:  I don't mean to be a discussion in itself but 
  basically the there's rfcs that go through life cycle so this is 
  the page where they publish all the rfc's their request for 
  comments and then in the Ares agent test our Nest there's 
  different tags correlating to the rfc's themselves.
Patrick St-Louis:  So if you go.
Patrick St-Louis:  The features or the concepts you can add 
  specific ifc's and the test harness their specific tags that 
  going to mention while if you want to run all the tests that are 
  about accepted or if C or if it's a work in progress or depending 
  on the maturity of the RFC you can test these specific test so 
  it's a behavior driven test Suite so it works.
Patrick St-Louis:   Us with believe it's.
Patrick St-Louis:  Behave it's a python it's written in Python.
Patrick St-Louis:  And yeah it's a there's a lot to it.
Patrick St-Louis:  But I'd be happy to talk about this maybe 
  another time.
Manu Sporny:  Okay okay yeah so but at the high level what we're 
  trying to get to the design is designed around making sure that 
  we've got something that's agreed by the working group officially 
  testable on the normative statements in repeatable on a 
  consistent basis with exports to different data formats that can 
  be rendered in different ways fundamentally you know I think 
  that's that's what we're trying to get to.
Manu Sporny:   To as an industry.
Manu Sporny:  Okay so that's you know about design the the 
  there's a mocha w3c interop reporter you can generate other kind 
  of plugins to render it in different ways and then we have this 
  implementations directory which is where implementers come in and 
  create pull requests for different infrastructure right and so if 
  we look at like one of the most recent ones is measure I owe this 
  is where they list their oath to.
Manu Sporny:   To credential.
Manu Sporny:  And of course we don't store the secrets and clear 
  text those are protected secrets we have you know they're issuer 
  and points that they allow in then the tags they can tag 
  different ones with different things like this endpoint supports 
  the Edwards curve 2018 signature the verifiers you know this says 
  the tag say this is an oauth2 endpoint it supports the VC API.
Manu Sporny:   And then the company names measure.
Manu Sporny:  Easy so I think measure is our most recent 
  integrate T it took a day and a half for them to integrate that 
  tops and it's mostly because we had to like debug some of the 
  oauth tokens that you know the oauth2 stuff wasn't happening 
  appropriately so we had to look into why that was but it's meant 
  to be fairly easy and once you list your implementation here 
  it'll work off of all you know all of the different feature test 
  Suites that.
Manu Sporny:   That that exist.
Manu Sporny:  So that's design next item up or any questions on 
  design or how we're going to get into individual test Suites now 
  any questions on design before we get into individual test 
  Suites.

Topic: VC API Test Suite Status and Roadmap

Manu Sporny: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api-issuer-test-suite/
Manu Sporny:  Okay so individual test Suites I'm going to just 
  dump all these links into RC there in I will open all of them.
Manu Sporny:  Bit by bit so at presents.
Manu Sporny:  This is the latest run of the issuer test we'd so 
  this this test Suite remember these are modular this only tests 
  issuance that's the issuer API endpoint there so it's one end 
  point and adjust tests the options that you send to that endpoint 
  in that it actually generates something useful that comes back so 
  the tests are really really simple here and as you can see we've 
  got six one two three four five six.
Manu Sporny:  Implementations listed so far with another.
Manu Sporny:  On the way that we know of the.
Manu Sporny:  You know a check mark means that they pass the test 
  so for example this just texts check test to make sure that if 
  you give it a valid credential the issue with valid options that 
  it'll issue something and that's it that's all it all it does 
  right and if you go over you hover over here you can see why 
  certain implementations are failing right so at least it gives 
  you data it may be inscrutable data but.
Manu Sporny:   In this case we can see.
Manu Sporny:  At this implementer has made the credential subject 
  a text string which is a violation of the specification so that's 
  why this one's failing it's not an object it's texturing in in 
  that's feedback right that's just one test and then there are 
  other things that they pass like the request body must have a 
  property of credential that's that's the request of the issuance 
  and point the response must.
Manu Sporny:   That context defined that must be in a.
Manu Sporny:  That must include only strings that you know the 
  credential must have a type property that must be an array and so 
  on and so forth right and again this is just testing some basic 
  stuff it's not testing for example credential reissuance it's not 
  testing revocation it's not testing the digital signature that's 
  on the credential itself and so on and so forth right.
Manu Sporny:  Patrick please go ahead.
Patrick St-Louis:  What about the other endpoint specifying and 
  the DC API specification sources like their credential status and 
  point which is meant to change the status of the credential is 
  that planning to be included in this test later or is it limited 
  to the credential issue and point.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah excellent question this is limited to the 
  credential issue and point that's it. Right and so the the 
  credential status in point will be a different modular test suite 
  and these things are fairly easy to put together but that's 
  that's a different test Suite it'll have different tests 
  different normative statements in here that's tested so for 
  example like this one is the verifier endpoint in the only thing 
  this test is the verify and point in any options that you pass.
Manu Sporny:   Stew it in.
Manu Sporny:  Checks to make sure that invalid credentials will 
  not verify right so there are all these tests that are done here 
  it must not verify if the context is not an array must not verify 
  if the items are not strings it must not verify if and so on and 
  so forth right and then we've got a couple of failures here where 
  the verification should have failed but it didn't for some reason 
  right.
Manu Sporny:  So this is another endpoint credential status will 
  be another endpoint the exchanges stuff will be another sorry 
  another test Suite go ahead Patrick.
Patrick St-Louis:  I ran it a few times in the so the Mavs net 
  there's ever that's gets reported and I had the same error on my 
  test and it's a very strange error message so I don't know this 
  is the right place to discuss that maybe open an issue but it 
  says message to not exist and I'm not too sure.
Manu Sporny:  You may want to raise an issue on the test Suite in 
  someone like this one Tachi might get back to you to talk through 
  like to look at why it's failing right one of the other things 
  that might be good is if you have an endpoint go ahead and submit 
  your implementation so that we can start running it so that other 
  developers can kind of try and debug why that you know what it's 
  getting back from the end point and what it's expecting to get 
  get back and so on and so forth.
Manu Sporny:   Okay but yeah it's.
Manu Sporny:  Of them already it's like this one's just 
  inscrutable like who knows what's going on here right and so 
  we're going to try and improve the error reporting here.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah I think that's that's you know we have to 
  improve the airport in here right this is you can't you have no 
  idea what's going on here.
Manu Sporny:  But fundamentally you know these are / in points 
  modular tests that test the specific the specification itself 
  right we also have other modular test Suites for testing things 
  like digital signature so this is specifically a cryptography 
  sweet test for the Ed to 55:19 Signature 2020 test Suite we've 
  got you know it tests the issuer side of this it tests the 
  verifier will hold on.
Manu Sporny:   On it tested at the data Integrity level.
Manu Sporny:  Meaning the data Integrity spec level and then it 
  tested at the specific crypto Suite level so it tests to make 
  sure that you know the byte ranges are proper in the valid you 
  know a valid signature verifies has as valid and an invalid 
  signature does not verify.
Manu Sporny:  Make sure that you're throwing certain errors like 
  malformed errors if you have a mouth Forum signature same thing 
  it checks to make sure that the proper data set canonicalization 
  algorithm is run and here's the interop here's the N by n Matrix 
  Patrick that you asked about before right so this is if one 
  person issues a credential with this signature on it can the 
  other systems verify.
Manu Sporny:   It right.
Manu Sporny:  We see these vendors are interoperable but these 
  ones are not necessarily.
Manu Sporny:  That makes sense.
Patrick St-Louis:  Yeah yes it does a lot so that's what the 
  issuer name environment variable is for it basically decides 
  which issuer is going to issue the credential to verify.
Manu Sporny:  Well it'll do an N by n so any it'll run all of the 
  implementations against all the other implementations for this 
  specific feature.
Manu Sporny:  So for the Edwards curve signature it'll have one 
  and issue it and another and verify it.
Manu Sporny:  It'll do an end by in test against all of them.
Manu Sporny:  And I think the reason these folks are not passing 
  it as they don't support the Edwards curve signature but for some 
  reason they're included in the in the tests will have to look 
  into that anyway this is basically to show that we are doing in 
  by in testing as well here and then finally we're using the same 
  infrastructure to do did method testing as well right and so this 
  is very early days it has nothing to.
Manu Sporny:   To do with the VC API but is kind of a day.
Manu Sporny:  Early modular infrastructure that can be used 
  across.
Manu Sporny:  Many different types of VC did you know ecosystem 
  tests and they're more of these modular test Suites on the way 
  these are just the ones that you know we feel comfortable sharing 
  you know at this time there are ones that are we're working on 
  for credential status so revocation suspension and they're also 
  ones that were working on for credential refresh.
Manu Sporny:   And then they'll probably.
Manu Sporny:  DEC 20 2014 just like did authentication for 
  example.
Kerri Lemoie: :+1:
Manu Sporny:  They will of course be ones that are very specific 
  to certain types of credentials and certain type of credential 
  flows like maybe carry we might want to talk about one for the 
  jff plugfest or some kind of Workforce credentialing flow or 
  something like that the sky's the limit.
Manu Sporny:  That's that's primarily it any any other questions 
  or concerns around kind of the test Suite it status kind of 
  roadmap where we're going with it what we're trying to achieve.
Patrick St-Louis:  This is very interesting thank you.
Manu Sporny:  No problem thanks for all the good commentary and 
  questions.
Patrick St-Louis:  What kind of help how's it like I do you are 
  you looking for to help for this this is obviously being an open 
  source program are you open to contributions.
Manu Sporny:  So absolutely yeah I mean we'd love help on 
  anything in here so if anyone can see anything to improve here I 
  think the biggest help we may need is creation of new test Suites 
  for things that people want to test right so these are set up so 
  that you should be able to copy the test Suite just the base 
  template for it rip out all of the tests and put new tests in 
  right so if you wanted to.
Manu Sporny:   To test a different type of crypto sweet like.
Manu Sporny:  Your signatures or you know SEC ecdsa signatures we 
  need test Suites for that PC 20 data model will need test Suites 
  you know for that so yeah Patrick if there's some some place that 
  you'd like to help we have no shortage of work that needs to be 
  done on these.
Patrick St-Louis:  Because one of our project we want to build 
  this sort of interpretability bench you know that's sort of the 
  generic term and so far like the Aries agent test harness and the 
  test Suites of the liberal trees here the two most concrete sort 
  of.
Patrick St-Louis:  And we want to.
Patrick St-Louis:  Width and I know we are looking to hire a test 
  that the mation developer in the we certainly might be interested 
  in making some sort of contribution at some point.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah please do it would be it would be very welcome 
  so you happy to talk more I mean if you want to put aside you 
  know telecon time to talk about that or just you know work 
  through things and get Hub issues we'd love to love to chat about 
  that.
Patrick St-Louis:  Is there a channel for these type of 
  conversation or these meetings are the only platform for this.
Manu Sporny:  So there's an IRC channel the GitHub issue tracker 
  in the credentials community group mailing list or probably the 
  best places to have a conversation.
Patrick St-Louis:  Perfect thank you.
Manu Sporny:  So for synchronous communication it's this these 
  calls for asynchronous communication that's throw around ideas 
  it's the credentials community group mailing list and then if for 
  very specific targeted conversations GitHub issues or probably 
  the best.
Manu Sporny:  With that and because we want to try and stop 
  before the top of the hour I think that's the call for today any 
  last words before we end the call.
<kerri_lemoie> Appreciate this!
Manu Sporny:  Okay thanks everyone we will get back to issue 
  processing next week during next week's call and then the 
  following week we will be skipping the call because of the w3c 
  technical plenary in Vancouver okay thanks everyone have a great 
  rest of the week take care bye.
