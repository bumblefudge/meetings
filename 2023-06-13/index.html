<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:   It makes things quite difficult to change and. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  It&apos;s also quite easily resolvable there&apos;s tons and tons of Bitcoin nodes that have exist in the world and basically you can get the data for this did method from from any of those. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  So let&apos;s move on to the meat of this which is ordinal inscriptions so what the heck is that that&apos;s a word I&apos;ve heard before ordinal but I don&apos;t know how that relates to bitcoin basically so it&apos;s at the end of last year like maybe December so this guy named Casey Radha more kind of created this this Theory ordinal Theory which essentially gives a number an identifier to every Satoshi in Bitcoin. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  Satoshi so it&apos;s two issues are the smallest unit of account on bitcoin and essentially using ordinal Theory you can give it each of those satoshi&apos;s and number which the number can be translated to different formats like the decimal format which is the Bloc numbered dot the offset within the block there&apos;s names which just uses English characters and has a mapping that he&apos;s come up with and then there&apos;s a few other formats like a degree no. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  Most is the the name version which kind of gives you the possibly a human-readable things often it&apos;s just random characters but you can find hidden human-readable Satoshi names. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  So these sets they are just held in regular Bitcoin wallets there&apos;s nothing special about them they are just in sitting and utx Os that you control with your private key and you can kind of look up what satoshi&apos;s are included in a UT x 0 using the ordinal client which is an index on top of the Bitcoin note that you would also have need to be right. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:   So you can also you can. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  Is so she&apos;s there&apos;s like I said regular Satoshi so you can transfer them just like regular using regular Bitcoin transactions the only caveat to that is that you need to. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  Basically is ordinals aware because because they are regular sets they can like easily if a ball while it doesn&apos;t know about them will just accidentally spend them as fees or you know if you&apos;re trying to pay someone it&apos;ll just it&apos;ll just play with them because it thinks that they&apos;re just regular sets. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  Then the most important part to this all is that they can be inscribed with arbitrary data so this uses segregated witness Taproot data and on the right there you can see the envelope that you&apos;ve essentially kind of put the data inside of so there&apos;s a push saying just ORD and then another push that tells you the content file type and then another push telling you the actual content so this can be just you know any any sort of. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  That&apos;s what inscriptions are there yeah like that arbitrary data that&apos;s written to the Bitcoin Ledger and you know it can be pruned off but it&apos;s also exhibits on all the nodes by default kind of thing and these are they&apos;re immutable these data blobs are in a mood to be linked to that sets the ordinal that you&apos;re writing to you can basically always look up the data that was inscribed to it and what this does is it creates unique Bitcoins. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:   Native digital artifacts so. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Brian Richter</span>:  Mark outlined what a digital artifact is and the most you know pertinent most important things are kind of like their complete they&apos;re not links to off chain data they are you can hold artifact and it holds all of the information that&apos;s needed about it and doing all this you get something that is as durable immutable secure and and decentralized as Bitcoin itself because it is just Bitcoin with some you know layer. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
