Mike Prorock:  Hello all and welcome to the weekly ccg meeting 
  for June 13th this is the year 2023 last I checked the topic for 
  today is posted to the list is the Bitcoin ordinals did method 
  which should be an interesting topic to discuss I think there's 
  some great technical Merit here and I am.
Mike Prorock:   Really curious to see.
Mike Prorock: https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/
Mike Prorock:  The walkthrough of one how we got here and to how 
  it works so definitely interested in it with that I do want to 
  start off the meeting by reminding everyone that there is a code 
  of ethics and professional conduct and I obviously this as well 
  as all w3c meetings are conducted under that code of ethics and 
  professional conduct so hopefully we won't need any reminders for 
  that during the call typically don't but just have to bring it 
  up.
Mike Prorock: https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/join
Mike Prorock:  Intellectual property note anyone May participate 
  in these calls this is a public call however any and all 
  substantive contributors to actual work items must be members of 
  the ccg agree so the w3c credentials community group with an IPR 
  agreement signed and I'll put the link to join if you're for some 
  reason not a member the you will need a W3 account for that but 
  that's free Etc and it can walk you through that so as.
Mike Prorock:   As with all of our meetings.
Mike Prorock:  And meetings will go up to our GitHub along with 
  the audio recordings cetera we do manage chat via the jitsi side 
  which is also linked to IRC in case you're in Via IRC but if you 
  want to type it in the letter q followed by the plus sign will 
  add you to the queue the minus sign after the letter Q will 
  subtract you from the queue or you can click raised hand in that 
  UNC interface and that will also put you on the Queue so with 
  that I want to pause.
Mike Prorock:   As quickly any introductions reintroductions as 
  anyone changed.
Mike Prorock:  Job new role or as anyone brand-new to this 
  meeting that would like to introduce themselves Paul's here.
Mike Prorock:  Seeing no one come off of mute I'm going to also 
  just side note that the transcriber is freaking terrible today 
  with or especially with me so anyways with that I'm going to move 
  on any announcements I know I have one for sure just for folks to 
  be aware of but anyone else have any announcements for the ccg to 
  me.
Mike Prorock:  Watching Q here.
Mike Prorock:  Not seeing any I am going to note that if you are 
  a member of the VC working group you are already aware of this 
  but if you're not but do monitor the list cetera a lot of stuff 
  is starting to work its way into horizontal review so this is 
  privacy internationalisation and tag etcetera so there could be 
  changes coming to some of that based on feedback from horizontal 
  view so just be watching that stuff closely if you're 
  implementing on that sign.
Mike Prorock:   With that I am going to move.
Mike Prorock: 
  https://github.com/ordinalsreserve/btco/blob/main/spec.md
Mike Prorock:  To the main agenda here so we're fortunate enough 
  to have Brian Richter here to talk today about the Bitcoin 
  ordinals did method so basically it did method that mixes the 
  security idea of blockchains particularly the Bitcoin blockchain 
  with ordinal Theory so there is a spec for this and I'm going to 
  copy and paste that directly into the chat and then I'm going to 
  just hand the ball to Brian to take it away and I will be 
  monitoring.
Mike Prorock:   During Cube to jump in and out.
Mike Prorock:  You know put folks on the point to ask questions 
  at appropriate pause stuff so with that Brian over to you.
Brian Richter:  Cool thanks Mike yeah so come on everyone my name 
  is Brian Richter I have a company and I've been involved in this 
  space for a few years now companies a very Tech some of you might 
  know me some of you might not but yeah I'm excited today to 
  present to you guys the Bitcoin ordinals did method the the spec 
  that Mike link there is the latest currently.
Brian Richter:   But there's a lot of changes in this.
Brian Richter:  Haven't made it in there yet so looking forward 
  to moving things forward so I'm going to share my screen here 
  hopefully that'll work.
Brian Richter:  That can be true.
Mike Prorock:  You are coming through nice and clear.
Brian Richter:  Yeah so the did BT CE o-- the start I don't think 
  this group really needs an introduction to decentralized 
  identifiers everyone pretty much knows it I think but I want to 
  point out the three properties in the middle there are extremely 
  you know very pertinent to the Bitcoin so Bitcoin is very 
  decentralized as we as we know it's persistent the hash power 
  behind it as.
Brian Richter:   It makes things quite difficult to change and.
Brian Richter:  It's also quite easily resolvable there's tons 
  and tons of Bitcoin nodes that have exist in the world and 
  basically you can get the data for this did method from from any 
  of those.
Brian Richter:  So let's move on to the meat of this which is 
  ordinal inscriptions so what the heck is that that's a word I've 
  heard before ordinal but I don't know how that relates to bitcoin 
  basically so it's at the end of last year like maybe December so 
  this guy named Casey Radha more kind of created this this Theory 
  ordinal Theory which essentially gives a number an identifier to 
  every Satoshi in Bitcoin.
Brian Richter:   So a one Bitcoin can be broken down to.
Brian Richter:  I forget how many but a.
<mprorock> 100 million satoshis to one bitcoin
Brian Richter:  Satoshi so it's two issues are the smallest unit 
  of account on bitcoin and essentially using ordinal Theory you 
  can give it each of those satoshi's and number which the number 
  can be translated to different formats like the decimal format 
  which is the Bloc numbered dot the offset within the block 
  there's names which just uses English characters and has a 
  mapping that he's come up with and then there's a few other 
  formats like a degree no.
Brian Richter:   Location different formats the one I've been.
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> (as usual) 
  Link to deck?
Brian Richter:  Most is the the name version which kind of gives 
  you the possibly a human-readable things often it's just random 
  characters but you can find hidden human-readable Satoshi names.
<mprorock> @ted - will make sure that it gets posted to list
Brian Richter:  So these sets they are just held in regular 
  Bitcoin wallets there's nothing special about them they are just 
  in sitting and utx Os that you control with your private key and 
  you can kind of look up what satoshi's are included in a UT x 0 
  using the ordinal client which is an index on top of the Bitcoin 
  note that you would also have need to be right.
Brian Richter:   So you can also you can.
Brian Richter:  Is so she's there's like I said regular Satoshi 
  so you can transfer them just like regular using regular Bitcoin 
  transactions the only caveat to that is that you need to.
Brian Richter:  Basically is ordinals aware because because they 
  are regular sets they can like easily if a ball while it doesn't 
  know about them will just accidentally spend them as fees or you 
  know if you're trying to pay someone it'll just it'll just play 
  with them because it thinks that they're just regular sets.
Brian Richter:  Then the most important part to this all is that 
  they can be inscribed with arbitrary data so this uses segregated 
  witness Taproot data and on the right there you can see the 
  envelope that you've essentially kind of put the data inside of 
  so there's a push saying just ORD and then another push that 
  tells you the content file type and then another push telling you 
  the actual content so this can be just you know any any sort of.
Brian Richter:   Of content and also.
Brian Richter:  Any sort of life that you want.
Brian Richter:  That's what inscriptions are there yeah like that 
  arbitrary data that's written to the Bitcoin Ledger and you know 
  it can be pruned off but it's also exhibits on all the nodes by 
  default kind of thing and these are they're immutable these data 
  blobs are in a mood to be linked to that sets the ordinal that 
  you're writing to you can basically always look up the data that 
  was inscribed to it and what this does is it creates unique 
  Bitcoins.
Brian Richter:   Native digital artifacts so.
Brian Richter:  Mark outlined what a digital artifact is and the 
  most you know pertinent most important things are kind of like 
  their complete they're not links to off chain data they are you 
  can hold artifact and it holds all of the information that's 
  needed about it and doing all this you get something that is as 
  durable immutable secure and and decentralized as Bitcoin itself 
  because it is just Bitcoin with some you know layer.
Brian Richter:   He's on top of it which are embedded in the 
  network.
Brian Richter:  I'm so the current uses that people have come up 
  with is they've been writing just regular images into these 
  inscriptions a lot of people are just been copy-pasting other 
  entities and uploading them onto the coin and saying this is an 
  interesting new thing and you know obviously it's nothing special 
  but that's what people are doing or buying them selling them and 
  there's also a naming system like a lot of people come up with 
  these really pretty dumb protocols.
Brian Richter:   Which is just the first.
Brian Richter:  I have a name onto the thing is one who owns that 
  name you can transfer that whoever you want or whatever like that 
  doesn't have any of the properties that we want and dids but 
  that's the come another thing that's kind of popped up is the arc 
  20 which is a token protocol like a fungible token protocol on 
  top of this it's not the best for call it's you know costs a lot 
  to just be moving tokens around so it's not.
Brian Richter:   It's not nothing special but people doing it 
  people.
Brian Richter:  These tokens and you could also just embed you 
  know like a full HTML page on there so there's people uploaded 
  like a cone of Doom and the guy some Minecraft lots of different 
  things and then some cheeky people and me and my brother created 
  a couple verify your credentials put some art that he did in 
  there and called a pub Collectibles and we give those people 
  there's also you know kind of unbounded future.
Brian Richter:   He's with this like it's just.
Brian Richter:  The other day that you can own and by itself so 
  it's interesting to see what people are coming up with and 
  obviously as I'm discussing here another important use case I 
  think is putting dids inside of these inscriptions so how do we 
  do that I'll go through all of the different operations in the 
  did method so the first of course is the create operation I 
  wanted to make sure that there was you know.
Brian Richter:   A few.
Brian Richter:  To do it that all kind of work the same basically 
  I want you to be able to upload or inscribe just the fold did 
  document that you want to use so you could just create a did 
  document embed the sap that you're writing it to into the 
  identifier as you can see on the right there that one hij is the 
  name of that side so this did document is is for that it's out 
  there.
Brian Richter:   I've also.
Brian Richter:  Want to come.
Brian Richter:  The compressed did document format so to save a 
  little bit of transaction fees because this is quite a lot of 
  data that you're writing it could potentially get quite costly so 
  compressed format is it's pretty important I haven't you know 
  haven't landed on exactly what to do there but there's a few 
  different ideas like that one on the behind there is the kind of 
  the it's basically did pier and I'm not go too.
Brian Richter:   What's a little bit of a prefix there to.
Brian Richter:  Point out that it's a did I've also thought about 
  maybe using compression like Sea border or broadly or I'm not 
  entirely sure yet but I think there's going to be a good 
  standardized way to do that I also had a call with one of the 
  ordinals devs and he was pointing out that you could also do 
  basically key-value stores in here so that's another possibility 
  just kind of.
Brian Richter:   Betting the keys of the deduct human.
Brian Richter:  Directly with their values as possible.
Brian Richter:  So that's how you create and then when you want 
  to look one of these things up to resolve it basically you grab 
  the method specific identifier and the top right there you can 
  see L WM l dot Theta whatever you look up what you T XO that sat 
  is currently sitting in you got that you T XO and you.
Brian Richter:   You basically look.
Brian Richter:  What the first sat in that you txo the first 
  inscription that you find because if you've updated then the 
  current state is is is very first sat in there and then you read 
  that inscription you find the current state if that.
Brian Richter:  Is the the null inscription which I haven't 
  really defined yet but basically you're saying I'm deactivating 
  this this did I'm not going to use it right now then it's sitting 
  there as in a deactivated State you could also burn this in the 
  description by setting it to a well-known burn address and then 
  no one be able to move it kind of thing.
Brian Richter:   And that's basically.
Brian Richter:  How you looking look up the current state.
Brian Richter:  As I alluded to before to update basically you 
  inscribe a new document into a noose at and you transfer along 
  with that the original GID so the one that people will be looking 
  up has to be in sitting that you txo probably at the end of it.
Brian Richter:   And then you can optionally you can.
Brian Richter:  Would all the.
Brian Richter:  The states as well so you can basically build 
  this package of all the states that have happened for your D ID 
  you could also kind of compress those those States and you know 
  take the value out of those those previously inscribe States 
  because there's at the end day there's sat sitting in there so 
  there's kind of money.
Brian Richter:   And then.
Brian Richter:  To deactivate like I said you can update it to 
  the no inscription which is kind of saying I'm deactivating this 
  right now but I might be able to turn it back on the future so 
  that's reversible deactivation and then there's also the ability 
  to irreversibly burn the inscription.
Brian Richter:  So this obviously has some advantages and 
  disadvantages this method the big advantage that that I like 
  about this and the reason I created or made it is that you know 
  this is layer one Bitcoin this is there's an 0 part counterparty 
  risks there's you know nothing else you need to look up 
  everything is within your Bitcoin know basically of course you 
  need to have the.
Brian Richter:   Mapping of sets to the.
Brian Richter:  UT EXO's but that's that can be derived from the 
  Bitcoin node so it's always have a Bitcoin node you have 
  everything you need basically.
Brian Richter:  And that I believe basically creates the biggest 
  possibilities for Network effects in as far as decentralized 
  Ledger's go because Bitcoin is the most the most well-known 
  blockchain out there it's the first and it you know it's easiest 
  to get it's the easiest to kind of sink because it's the most 
  there's almost no weeds and most decentralized anything.
Brian Richter:   Of course that's has some.
Brian Richter:  Method so you do want to wait for one block 
  confirmation I would say to kind of trust that it did document is 
  written and is the current state so it's a bit slow of course you 
  could just kind of read them from the mempool if you wanted as 
  well and assume that it's going to be eventually inscribed but 
  you know that's you have to lay your wrist calling it there the 
  also because the fees rise as more people use the network with 
  them.
Brian Richter:   The way that the current bitcoin protocol or 
  Bitcoin Network.
Brian Richter:  X is like there.
Brian Richter:  The market basically so you kind of have to bid 
  for your block space so not too long ago their the fees went up 
  kind of a crazy amount it costs $16 to send a regular transaction 
  and then these ones that have a bit more data in them so they 
  cost would cost you more than that so at some point it's kind of 
  not really reasonable to use this method but for the most part 
  right now the fees are low enough that it it's possible that kind 
  of get what you want in.
Brian Richter:  So those are the trade-offs I think you know for 
  some use cases the advantages overcome the disadvantages 
  definitely but it's kind of we'll see so what work is there left 
  to do I would say like the compressed format I mentioned isn't 
  quite ironed out you know the burn address and what a known 
  scription is there's a few little details I need to kind of work 
  out and then I want to do another pass of the the spec and make 
  sure it's all.
Brian Richter:   Up to you.
Brian Richter:  And then obviously I have to build an 
  implantation I haven't quite done that yet I've done a little bit 
  of the first operation creating I've created some and put them on 
  the Ledger but I haven't haven't kind of gone through the the 
  rest of the operations but especially because the specification 
  is not entirely ready I would say it's a bit more to kind of 
  research and then once that's ready I'll make a universal 
  resolver put this up on the you know allow.
Brian Richter:   Anyone to kind of.
Brian Richter:  The universe of resolver so you don't have to run 
  a Bitcoin now because I don't expect the normal user to want to 
  do that so.
Brian Richter:  And yeah so I'd say I'm hoping to get some some 
  interest in moving this along I want to start doing weekly 
  meetings starting on Thursday I think around 10 a.m. probably and 
  then this this coming week I'm hoping to have the first one I've 
  created a Google meet I don't really know the organization of 
  where this will be but I want to start with Google meeting kind 
  of talk to people that are interested in I hope you hope you are 
  there hope you interested in coming so yeah that's kind of the.
Brian Richter:  Station for today I have a couple Advanced topics 
  if you guys want to get into those or if there's any other 
  thoughts or questions.
Mike Prorock:  Signal went on the Q yet I could start it off with 
  kind of to two quick questions I guess one would be well start 
  with one actually since to be true just queued up the one would 
  be are you concerned at all about.
Mike Prorock:  You know like transferring someone's Identity or 
  sale of identities etcetera and things like that.
Brian Richter:  Yeah so that's a great question I've thought 
  about it a little bit I'm interested in hearing what kind of the 
  consensus for that is I've kind of I've heard both sides of it 
  like you should be able to kind of transfer these identities to a 
  different private key or different ownership kind of thing and 
  different person but obviously that has attack vectors of 
  impersonation and all that so my original update mechanism.
Brian Richter:   Like what.
Brian Richter:  And a transfer was basically burning that d i d 
  and I'm not against moving back to that I want to hear kind of 
  what other people think but yeah essentially there's a way we 
  could design this so that transfer would end up deciding 
  deactivating the ID so you wouldn't be able to kind of sell these 
  things.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So my question is is there a storage limit per 
  single transaction how does I'm not sure I fully understand the 
  ordinal model being talked about how like what the cost per byte 
  is basically War if there is a storage limit to the.
Brian Richter:  Yes there definitely is a storage method how it 
  works is I think this push here with the like hello world if this 
  is too long I think there's a limit to the amount that you can 
  push in there so you can but you can all continue to break it up 
  into multiple pushes however there is essentially a limit I think 
  it's around like 400 K 3 and k or something of transaction itself 
  or else it won't be kind of relayed by the Bitcoin Network.
Brian Richter:   So there is there's limitations on that regard.
Brian Richter:  You can't get too large of like you know if your 
  did document was a megabyte you might you wouldn't be able to do 
  that really but for for the most part it's a reasonable limit and 
  then as far as the cost so this is a very extreme case it's 
  roughly around actually like 20 to 30 these days which is.
Brian Richter:   I would say.
Brian Richter:  To get a compressed form at 22:30 set v b on 
  there for around like 50 cents a little bit less but it could go 
  up to like five or so dollars now interestingly so because this 
  is in the the segregated witness data you actually get a only 
  cost you 25 percent of the set v b pricing because he had a 
  witness debt discount on that which is kind of funny.
Brian Richter:  Um yeah so I haven't thought too deeply about it 
  but I like if you are in control of a SAT and you know the name 
  of it or the the idea 10 to power of it you can you could 
  definitely create a did document that looks like this or whatever 
  and you can have the the SAT name in there and stuff.
Brian Richter:  Like inscribing it on to the the ordinal would 
  obviously make it discoverable but you you would be able to I 
  guess send this did document before you inscribe it and kind of 
  show someone and then you could also prove ownership over that 
  it's at as well so that's an interesting idea for sure you could.
Brian Richter:  You could you could definitely play around with 
  that.
Brian Richter:  Totally yes oh so interestingly so the the way 
  that the actual ordinal inscription works is there's there's 
  actually two transactions there's a commit transaction which is 
  basically like what like what you said it's your kind of putting 
  the commitment on to The Ledger whatever and then there's the 
  reveal transaction afterwards that reveals the data and actually 
  embeds the did it data.
Brian Richter:  The you could just do the commit transaction and 
  go around showing people your to document whatever and then at 
  some point in the future describe it if you want that kind of 
  thing.
Mike Prorock:  Watching for other questions here as far as 
  standardization path I mean obviously you've got a good initial 
  spec up on.
Mike Prorock:  No up on GitHub etcetera I mean are you do you 
  have you figured out is this something you think you you know 
  want to roll down the diff direction or ccg or something else or 
  if you looked at Pros cons Etc.
Brian Richter:  Yes I've a little bit kind of you know thought 
  about where to kind of do this work for sure the I do want to 
  make sure that it's open to you know it's inviting to people that 
  are in the kernel space that actually kind of know how this stuff 
  works it might be kind of.
Brian Richter:  Need to kind of get those people to come to the 
  ccg you and his group that they don't know anything about or if 
  where it seems like the essential identity and they're more 
  interested in ordinals and Bitcoin stuff so I'm you know trying 
  to figure out where exactly the best best place to do that is 
  open suggestions for sure.
Mike Prorock:  Cool and then I guess the other side is this 
  something you think that as an approach could be more generalized 
  and have that going as one potential aspect but then permit use 
  of other chains is that something you've looked at you know 
  because obviously Bitcoins we got some uniqueness as far as like 
  having a set break apart I think it's 100 million or something to 
  one from a you know ratio standpoint of SATs to you know be TC 
  but.
Mike Prorock:   It seems like other chains even even private 
  letters could.
Mike Prorock:  You have similar type properties right is that 
  something you've looked at possibly exploding.
Brian Richter:  Yeah totally so really the method like I'm trying 
  to making sure to make it kind of like an agnostic way so that as 
  long as the the chain supports ordinals you can you can do it and 
  like for example like there's a doge ordinals protocol there's 
  Litecoin or nose protocol and all of them I don't see a reason 
  why they wouldn't be able to support the exact same thing.
Keith Kowal:  Hey thanks brother looks great could you explain I 
  didn't quite follow the update methodology so like in particular 
  like sorry I'll just go to the verifiable crunch world like I am 
  issued a verifiable credential with this did and then a year 
  later there's an update operation so I certainly understand like 
  in the updated sat it can reference the old SAT but if you were 
  looking at that VC like what would your resolver do with your 
  like I don't think the resolver can't look at all SATs and try to 
  figure out the current state.
Keith Kowal:   Of the of the like how would that work maybe I'm 
  just missing something.
Brian Richter:  Yeah so how I think it would work is so if your 
  resolver like you know the date that you're trying to resolve the 
  the D ID for and the resolver could basically look up at that 
  date what was the latest block and from there the you can look 
  you can query the join node for like the most recent you.
Brian Richter:   EXO that that's at was.
Brian Richter:  Took the second question was transferred in and 
  find that basically would be like the current state right so from 
  that block height that you're interested in which is the you can 
  find from the most recent transfer of the setting question and 
  then you can find the utx of there and find the first inscription 
  some extent.
Keith Kowal:  Okay yeah I got it I thought you were creating an 
  sorry yeah I thought maybe you lost the connection to the oil 
  said okay thank you.
Brian Richter:  Now you have some like that's the the important 
  thing is like the new state and the initial state are tied 
  together in a UT XO.
Brian Richter:  So I do have a couple of advanced topics here 
  which I think we did kind of touch on a little bit the pre 
  rotation so the commit revealed transaction format of inscription 
  is is definitely an interesting thing to play with being able to 
  basically commit to a rotation of your of your did document I 
  think is valuable if you do you know that your next key is going 
  to be before you make that live you can kind of commit to it.
Brian Richter:  Trying to get to the same sort of idea that Kerry 
  has ever lived and then the next kind of advanced topic is 
  basically so because you're doing this update over time you're in 
  each of those inscriptions has like an envelope of SATs in it it 
  might be quite a bit of money that you've kind of accumulated 
  into your you're basically your old States and you can add some 
  point you can basically fuse those back and create money out of 
  them and turn your kind of receipts into money and just kind of 
  fun.
Brian Richter:   Importantly like all you really needed the end 
  of the day is the.
Brian Richter:  I need a state and the initial state to tie those 
  together all of the other states can kind of be looked at from 
  the previous you know using looking at the blockchain and then 
  yeah that's kind of the to advance things I wanted to mention.
Mike Prorock:  So one question I need to get a bit at transaction 
  time the because obviously with transaction times being what they 
  are along with costs this seems like it's something that's gonna 
  you know not necessarily like a use and burn type ID and it feels 
  like they're definitely use cases attached to this if you thought 
  through some of the most valuable use cases for this from a user 
  perspective where it may bring properties that aren't granted by 
  other did methods.
Brian Richter:  So for me specifically like I'm really interested 
  in using it not as like the as my like only identify right but as 
  an identifier that kind of helps people discover my other 
  identifiers because a lot of the did methods I've been using did 
  key to peer and stuff like there is no discoverability for them 
  so basically being able to discover using this big Network that 
  exists Bit Coin and not having to worry about.
Brian Richter:   Any any other thing in the world is.
Brian Richter:  It's kind of how I want to be able to be found 
  kind of thing.
Brian Richter:  But yeah so as far as like use cases and stuff I 
  it's pretty open like it's you know it's a very.
Brian Richter:  It's yeah it's same as all the other did methods 
  I would say okay.
Harrison_Tang: They have questions in regards to the cost of 
  earlier you mentioned about come in and rebuild you take when you 
  come into the transactions or you pick and then you don't pay 
  when you inscribe the data or how this kind of course works.
Brian Richter:  Yeah so you pay for both the commit is like not 
  very much data I think it's essentially the hash that you're 
  writing those is the only like big data piece that you're putting 
  in the command so it's you do have to pay for both but the commit 
  is not nearly as cost for costly but the the reveal is where 
  you're actually embedding the data so that is where the cost kind 
  of in a bit crazier.
Harrison_Tang: David so the bigger the data the more costly 
  becomes basically.
Brian Richter:  Totally yeah exactly.
Harrison_Tang: Got it and how does the update cost works like 
  when you update when you updated basically it's a commit and 
  rebuild again basically right.
Brian Richter:  Yeah exactly so it's update is relatively the 
  same price as a create I would say I haven't run the numbers or 
  anything on this but really like what is costly in in 
  inscriptions is the obviously inscribing itself transferring them 
  after you inscribe them is is a regular Bitcoin transaction so 
  there's not too much fees associated with that but of course 
  you're if you're transferring a whole bunch of this deal previous 
  States or whatever you're going to be it's going to be a bit 
  more.
Brian Richter:   Or data that you're kind of moving so you got to 
  pay a little bit more but yeah.
Brian Richter:  You're paying the same.
Brian Richter:  Around the same every time you update.
Brian Richter:  That is as long as the current fees are you know 
  relatively stable with if they going through skyrocketing then 
  the thing the current market rate kind of thing.
Mike Prorock:  We'll look again.
Brian Richter:  Hmm yeah I mean I definitely thought about it I'm 
  kind of of the opinion like like that the inscription should sort 
  of be self-contained obviously that is more costly but I think 
  like kind of the ability to just read that one inscription to 
  know the current state is pretty powerful versus kind of you know 
  driving the state from all of the.
Brian Richter:   The updates or whatever from.
Brian Richter:  Definitely for Simplicity but then of course 
  there's a trade-off it is more costly so I don't know laying 
  those pros and cons might be a thing that why should you should 
  explore a bit more that's good a great idea though.
Mike Prorock:  Watching for additional questions on the Queue 
  here.
Mike Prorock:  Any additional kind of unique properties you think 
  are worthy of highlighting or areas of either security concerns 
  or things like that that you may want to Dish analyze and on from 
  the community side.
Brian Richter:  Yeah that's a good question so.
Brian Richter:  Like I feel like it's the probably the same as 
  other did methods in this regard but like if you lose the control 
  of the private key that controls those SATs you are essentially 
  kind of losing control of your your identifier right I think most 
  death did methods kind of have this property right like that's 
  that's how public private key encryption you know drug-free 
  workplace.
<orie> sometimes there is guardianship / custodial recovery
Brian Richter:  I am wondering if there's mechanisms that should 
  be built into kind of being able to like signal like this did has 
  been kind of control has been lost with this did I need to move 
  to this one here that kind of thing yeah so are you mentions 
  guardianship custodial recovery and yeah that's kind of I'm 
  getting to is like.
<orie> but then that is easily exploited, with legal processes.
Brian Richter:  There are things that we should I should think 
  about building into the specification itself in that regard or 
  should I kind of want that question.
Mike Prorock:  And I think I'd love to hear or he's thoughts on 
  the process and sees chatting very nicely on the tech side 
  because I know he's thought about this issue so far away Ori.
Orie Steele:  Yeah I mean I think it just briefly like the did 
  specification doesn't distinguish between updates that are made 
  by the did controller updates that are made by the did method 
  operator under duress or whatever so like just be careful with 
  the word recovery like ion and diff like made it look like the 
  recovery was a did operation.
<harrison_tang> Christopher Allen's Blockchain Commons is doing 
  the "Collaborative Seed Recovery", which tries to solve this type 
  of issue
Orie Steele:  Update is a did Operation now if you decide that 
  you want to delegate update capability to someone you really 
  trust like your lawyer or your government or your priest that's 
  your call and if that's what there's a way to cryptographically 
  verify that update operations coming from another party that you 
  delegated to previously that's a valid thing for you to describe 
  in your particular did method but it's did method specific and 
  it's a variation on the update.
Orie Steele:   Parameter and.
Orie Steele:  You can build your did method to expose that 
  capability or you can choose not to expose that capability 
  because now people can be coerced into giving those rights away 
  it's sort of like the power of attorney thing like you know you 
  hear cases of people being convinced to sign power of attorney 
  documents when they weren't really sound of mind and then you 
  know later that causes the problems for them so you'll be super 
  careful with delegating to parties.
Orie Steele:   And making sure that that delegation.
Orie Steele:  A way that's safe and of course like once that 
  delegation is occurred there's now two points of attack for the 
  attacker they can go for review the did controller or they can go 
  for any of your Guardians and use that as a way of sort of 
  needing to get to you they can just go straight to your guardian 
  and rotate keys.
Brian Richter:  I think there's definitely things that need to be 
  thought about that for this method method as well as all didn't 
  did essentially.
Brian Richter:  Um yeah and then the other kind of question I 
  have for the community which might be brought up earlier is is 
  like this update method is this a good approach do you guys think 
  should I move back to like sort of a methodology that kind of 
  limits the ability to transfer these things or is this do you 
  think.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sense yeah so my question is so what does it 
  mean to transfer a did be Co said that you hand over keep on 
  Burger essentially delegating a particular dress tunic you.
<orie> is it like buying a house at a specific address?
Brian Richter:  It's like an actual Bitcoin transfer of the SATs 
  that descriptions are written on so it's yeah it's basically like 
  well one way would be to transfer the SATs to someone right to a 
  different private key different address and then of course the 
  other method would be to give them your address earlier so your 
  private key which would be the same as any sort of did method.
<orie> (lets not encourage private key transfers)
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In that regard I don't think you as the author 
  should worry too much about trying to prevent right because at 
  the end of the day people can always hand over their private keys 
  right like that it's not possible to prevent the transfer of 
  something like a did even in theory.
<orie> (you can't stop it, but you don't need to recommend it)
Brian Richter:  Actually and yeah or he's putting out in the 
  comments like let's not encourage private key transfers obviously 
  we don't want that but yeah like I kind of agreed to meet re like 
  at the end of the day like being able to transfer this did 
  document it did state to yourself at a different gear whatever 
  should be evaluates for sure so yeah.
Brian Richter:  To answer your previous question already it is 
  sort of like buying a house has specific address like that's why 
  the inscriptions kind of how they work so yeah.
Brian Richter:  I think Joe's out person again.
Mike Prorock:  Joe I think you're up.
Joe Andrieu:  Okay thanks yeah I want to pile on this plus one 
  about not limiting transfers I think one of the key reasons is 
  Bitcoin is a specific solution to a double spend problem and 
  unless you're going to allow that you probably want a less 
  expensive substrate like Bitcoin gives you that for a reason and 
  you pay for it so I think you should allow it otherwise you're 
  going to undermine why are we using Bitcoin at all but I think 
  for.
Joe Andrieu:   Perhaps some of your concerns about.
<orie> why are we using bitcoin at all?
<orie> spicee
Joe Andrieu:  Rated if you think about the difference between 
  identifiers and identity what you're selling is an identifier the 
  identity is is what results from the use of that identifier and 
  so you don't compromise an identity just because someone 
  transfers and identifiers and I think if you think about your the 
  security of your systems and that way you'll be better off.
Brian Richter:  Yeah that's that's good point thank you.
Mike Prorock:  Pizza think you're up.
Keith Kowal:  Maybe maybe I'm missing like I would have thought 
  that it doesn't matter in this but it doesn't have to matter who 
  is controlling the sad or who owns this at I would have thought 
  that maybe just an update operations you would want the signature 
  of the controller of the private key identified and they create 
  operation or deactivate operations and like I think that's what's 
  kind of interesting about this is it doesn't matter who whose 
  wallet this at sits in.
Keith Kowal:   But maybe I'm missing something.
Brian Richter:  No I don't think you are so like the set or the 
  sort of the key that owns the utx so that the status sitting in 
  that the document is sitting in is not related to the did itself 
  right like it's the owner its kind of the owner of the did but 
  it's not the.
Brian Richter:  Embedded within it which was a you know 
  relatively deliberate design decision kind of separating the 
  owner keys from the did keys are was was what I was trying to go 
  for there.
<orie> amusing to see eddsa keys in a secp256k1 registry system.
Keith Kowal:  And I got designed like a method I mean 
  theoretically a method operator could have a wall at world is sat 
  sieve sit but then the controller of the SAT could actually 
  direct update operations.
Keith Kowal:  Sensor that's not possible.
Brian Richter:  Yeah no that makes sense that's exactly right so 
  there could even be you could even have services that are doing 
  the kind of like the ownership side but you could be telling them 
  what did Keys your keys you want and you did document and stuff 
  right so those the separation of those concerns is kind of what I 
  was going for.
Brian Richter:  Yeah he points out that seeing you need to 55 
  women keys in a sec P 256 K 1 is funny and I thought so too and 
  that was the first thing that people commented on when I brought 
  this up on Twitter was people were like well why didn't you use 
  Bitcoin keys inside your kids and I was like well I don't have to 
  so why would I.
Mike Prorock:  Awesome well with that I'm going to just watch the 
  key for any last words questions comments.
Mike Prorock:  And I'll hand it over to Brian just for any 
  closing remarks etcetera and just wanted to thank you for your 
  time today and thank everyone for great engagement so.
Brian Richter:  Yeah thanks thanks for coming guys and thanks for 
  listening like I said I'd love to hear your love to get more 
  participation from outside of myself in this did method so I will 
  send out the link to the school meet afterwards and hope to hope 
  to see you guys there.
<orie> good luck standardizing BTC Method at W3C!
Mike Prorock:  Thanks so much I'm going to stop recording now and 
  please have a wonderful rest of your week.
<harrison_tang> Thanks!!
Mike Prorock:  102 Transcriber still running.
