<kimhd> Okay, let's get started. Today we're talking about 
  accreditation and we'll start with the IP note, anyone can 
  participate in these calls. However, all substantive contributors 
  to any CC G work items must be members of the CCP with full IPR 
  agreement signed
<kimhd> And the link to join the credentials community group is 
  available at this location and pasting into chat.
<kimhd> And before that, you would need to create a W three Web 
  Account and the link to do that is here. It's free to join 
  community groups. And lastly, the text of the W three C community 
  contributor license agreement is available at this link that I've 
  pasted into IRC.
<kimhd> Called it these minutes in an audio recording of 
  everything said on this call are archived at the CG meetings 
  repo.
<kimhd> And we're not using the word, we're not using the IRC 
  interface to queue and everything. And this call. Instead, you 
  can you can use the raise hand feature.
<kimhd> And will call on you and informally, you can definitely 
  type q plus in the chat and we'll get to you. We don't have that 
  many people. Well, we have a team, but in general we don't have 
  enough activity to really cause
<kimhd> Problems or Q backups.
<kimhd> Okay, let's get to introductions in reintroductions
<kimhd> We see if there's anyone new on the call. If there's 
  anyone new on the call that would like to introduce themselves, 
  please just speak up.
<kimhd> And we could also. So, let me make sure I'm not is. Can 
  people hear me.
<kimhd> Yes. Okay, great.
<kimhd> Sure. Perfect. I
<kimhd> Would yeah and just wanted to make sure
<kimhd> Okay, if no one knew I think let's move to 
  reintroductions and Brent. I'm not sure if I've called on you yet 
  for reintroductions, would you mind introducing yourself to the 
  group.
<bshambaugh> I'm sort of observing right now. I guess I've been 
  around this community for a while in and out or past six, seven 
  years. So I'm interested in learning a little bit more about what 
  you're up to.
<kimhd> Great, thank you. Brent.
<kimhd> Okay, let's go on to next part of the agenda. I'm not 
  sure if we have Anthony here yet. But I wanted to announce. We 
  have a new co chair joining the group. And that's Anthony 
  chemically airy.
<kimhd> And we're excited to have him join. He's been bringing a 
  lot of expertise from working in verifiable credentials in the 
  EDC I
<kimhd> Framework and so he's been really active in helping to 
  drive the agenda so far and push push forward work items so very 
  excited to have him join us.
<kimhd> Okay, now let's move to the main topic which is 
  accreditation and I want to start by saying that this is not any 
  sort of very well researched presentation on it. I think the goal 
  is that
<kimhd> We would want to. Well, let me let me bring up the issue 
  to start with. So, and I'll share my screen as well.
<kimhd> So we had talked about
<kimhd> The idea of dealing with accreditation.
<kimhd> As part of
<kimhd> As part of the modeling verifiable credentials for 
  education spec.
<kimhd> So Anthony called out a couple of approaches. So trusted 
  issuer lists VCs issued to organizations authorizing them to 
  issue educational credentials trusted accreditation organization 
  list. So, oh, there's a frowny face.
<kimhd> Huh oh that's a confused emoji. Okay. Um, let's see. So 
  So Jeannie responded with some CD DL terms which were really 
  useful.
<kimhd> I did a little poking around as well to see what are some 
  different approaches that are used, and I wanted to do a 
  presentation on it and this is more to get feedback from the 
  community. See if there's an other approaches that I'm not 
  familiar with.
<kimhd> And we can talk about how to move forward this issue in 
  the modeling, Doc.
<kimhd> So I'm going to switch
<kimhd> To this presentation, I'm hoping that you can see this
<kimhd> Accreditation screen, speak up and let me know if not, 
  and I'll reshare
<jim goodell> Looks good. Okay.
<kimhd> Do you want to send the link again.
<kimhd> So I did want to start with a non edu use case that I was 
  familiar with in terms of accreditation and that's used in the 
  barefoot, that is using verifiable credentials decentralized 
  identifiers and all the standards that we're working on.
<kimhd> And the example is is KYC or verification of individuals 
  acting on behalf, an organization.
<kimhd> So the use case comes from a pilot between consensus you 
  port in life. And I understand, actually, that I think it was 
  sovereign did did something similar. So I think the ideas are
<kimhd> Are similar I just did these worked on this or wrote this 
  up before I was aware of that pilot. So the global legal entity 
  identifier foundation or life.
<kimhd> They issue legal entity identifiers going to get 
  increasingly awkward with acronyms. So I apologize.
<kimhd> Which is a unique 20 digit identifier for companies and 
  the idea is to use this to reduce costs complexity of business 
  verification
<kimhd> Specifically what this prototype focused on was the idea 
  of combining these legal entity identifiers and verifiable 
  credentials to centralize identifiers to enable
<kimhd> Rapid verification of a person acting in an official 
  role. So I have a link to the medium article that that this is 
  based on
<timothy ruff> You can
<timothy ruff> Yeah so glad. I made a major announcement last 
  Thursday, so that they're moving forward with the feeling I which 
  is their verifiable LCI and starting in January.
<timothy ruff> And it's going to be using verifiable credentials 
  and they've got a big budget for it.
<timothy ruff> A couple of us have been engaged bike life to push 
  this forward and I put a little note in the in the thing here 
  that
<timothy ruff> The consensus you port PLC was one of five 
  different PCs that they did under a partnership with Deloitte to 
  help them basically explore the entire space.
<timothy ruff> And then they just made their announcement on 
  Thursday that they are going to move forward. They're not 
  actually going to use any of those five networks, they did go
<timothy ruff> Through the consensus report they did something 
  with last year, which uses quorum, they did something on 
  sovereign that a couple of others.
<timothy ruff> In the end, they decided to use carry for the to 
  become their own root of trust, but the beautiful thing is 
  they're going to be using be using standard verifiable 
  credentials and that all begins. They're about to embark on a big
<timothy ruff> Open source development initiative.
<timothy ruff> everything they're doing is going to be fully open 
  source and they're going to start dumping a bunch of resources 
  into it in a
<timothy ruff> Few weeks, beginning in January.
<kimhd> So the idea here. The, the general flow is is the same. 
  And so this is, you know, this is just an example I you know I 
  say
<kimhd> This is an example of how verifiable credentials and 
  decentralized identifiers and all of this can be used in that in 
  that framework so
<kimhd> The, the flow that was used in this prototype was that 
  life accredits a local operating unit and then it that enables in 
  that's a verifiable credential that allows it to issue le eyes so 
  so these legal entities, then can issue role credentials to oh 
  wait, let me see. Okay, sorry.
<kimhd> Yeah, so, then those are issued to legal entities which 
  are companies who then can issue role credentials to people 
  acting and official roles. So that could be someone who is
<kimhd> You know, a corporate officer who can use the role 
  credential to Sign and Submit regular regulatory filings.
<kimhd> So then regulators can view and verify the signatures of 
  the submitted documents. So not only. I think the typical flow 
  that we think are the typical like in game of verifiable 
  credentials that we we sort of
<kimhd> Show in use cases are just sort of focusing on this last 
  verifiable credential but but these sorts of end and flows are 
  really key to establishing the trust that we would need. And so 
  this is sort of a good general accreditation example. Let me see 
  if we ok so now coming on to CT DL.
<kimhd> I wanted to start with an example that was that Jeannie 
  link to in terms of the the sort of
<kimhd> how you would approach accreditation and CCL so there's 
  an example provided about a dental assisting certificate. And so 
  what this is doing in most will see this in a friendlier 
  graphical view, but it's basically saying
<kimhd> You know Santa Rosa Junior College.
<kimhd> Offers this dental assisting certificate and then it will 
  we won't go to look at the graphical view, but we want to say 
  various things about
<kimhd> About the you know the accreditation of the junior 
  college, etc. So let's look at this view. So we're saying Santa 
  Rosa Junior College.
<kimhd> Offers credential over here certificate rather we're 
  calling it credential in our terms, but that's certificate and CT 
  DL terms. This is the key lead here accredited by so there's a 
  quality assurance organization, the name is American Dental 
  Association and off over here as well. We have
<kimhd> We have this you know competency that's required. So, in 
  this is just spelling out the RDF triples, and, you know, in full 
  detail I included this in case it wasn't readable just given our 
  experience with tiny fonts last time.
<kimhd> Um, let's see. The other thing that I wanted to
<kimhd> To call out. So Jeannie listed here.
<kimhd> Some terms from CT DL. So see terms of credits approves 
  recognizes regulates revokes which seemed like a good
<kimhd> List of the kinds of terms that we need an accreditation.
<kimhd> And so this is actually this example this dental example 
  is taken from here.
<kimhd> Also these action classes looked really useful.
<kimhd> accredited by is definitely the most pertinent one
<kimhd> And I thought that there is some. Let me see. Let's look 
  at these actions real fast. Just looking at at Lluis's comment.
<kimhd> I'm not sure if I see suspend se vocal we can we can come 
  back to that that comment. So let's see.
<kimhd> So there's, there's that. The other example that I saw 
  kind of in the wild, of what is being used is the Open Badges 
  accreditation extension and this is an extension on the issuer
<kimhd> And so this is the these cases that an issue wants to 
  include detailed information about an accrediting organization as 
  it pertains to the program or bad show
<kimhd> The previous stencil example, example that we saw in the 
  Open Badges case. I actually didn't tailor this example to that 
  but but instead of the way it's model and see DDL, you know, it 
  would be issuer and then effectively you add this under the 
  issuer type, but the
<kimhd> concepts are very similar. Um, let's see what else I 
  think. Okay, so those are the main contact said I wanted to 
  provide
<kimhd> Um, any let me let me stop sharing for just a second. 
  Come back to see if there's any comments or discussion if you do 
  have comments.
<kimhd> It's a good time to see pace. So we have a Q plus
<kimhd> Okay, Adrian
<agropper> I sorry I just came in a few minutes ago. But my 
  question is, I'm familiar with notaries and vaccination cards, 
  where the verifiable credential is link for audit purposes to an 
  accredited other party.
<agropper> Right, so the doctor that signs.
<agropper> The doctor that signs of vaccination card has to have 
  a number that's published somewhere, presumably saying they're 
  credited to do vaccinations a notary has a stamp that has a 
  number that says they are accredited to notarized
<agropper> A credential and I'm curious whether either either of 
  the two models you are talking about or both could be equally 
  useful in those very common context, but they're not educational 
  in any sense of the word.
<kimhd> Yeah, that's a good question. I wonder if
<kimhd> Let me see if we have a queue right now.
<kimhd> Let's see any hands raised.
<kimhd> Oh great, Nate. I was going to call on you to talk to 
  your comment as well. So yes, Nate Europe.
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> Yeah, so there's a couple different 
  types of relationships in play. And then there's a few ways to 
  describe those relationships in the life example we saw the 
  relationship
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> The accrediting relationship saying I 
  have credit this organization to be able to do something, 
  expressed as a verifiable credential.
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> That record would be portable and 
  verifiable in the using similar mechanisms to the verifiable 
  credentials ultimately issued by say educational institution.
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> In the Open Badges and seek Adele 
  examples. We have a few different processes that we're looking 
  at. One is that
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> There's a organization college may be 
  issuing verifiable credentials to students to recognize 
  educational achievements, but this educational institution is 
  accredited and they have an accredited, but that a creditor is 
  not yet issuing verifiable portable
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> Records of that accreditation. So what 
  we have in the Open Badges extension and in the CTV L vocabulary 
  is the ability for an organization to describe. It's a creditor
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> This college is accredited by this, you 
  know, Northwest body of
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> You know, creditors that
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> Has local trust within the system. And 
  so as we think about accreditation. We need to make sure we don't 
  mix up these two different types of things. And then also decide 
  what we want to actually accomplish
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> Do we want to just allow our issuers to 
  describe what organizations they are accredited by in the real 
  world, so that you can
<nate otto (badgr/csky)> Phone up the creditor and ask them about 
  it or do we want to provide the mechanisms for accreditation to 
  also be represented as verifiable credential alongside the sort 
  of core verifiable credentials representing degrees competencies, 
  etc.
<kimhd> Exactly. And I wonder if the
<kimhd> Okay, so yeah. Anthony says ideally both. I was thinking 
  that originally
<kimhd> From the framing of it that only one of them, which is 
  not necessarily the navigate ability, all the way back to the 
  original source of trust. But yes, ideally it would be both.
<kimhd> Asia. And you're right, we need to deal with audit. In 
  either case, I think, you know, the using just the one, the idea 
  of saying I am accredited by
<kimhd> X where you know some relying party or verifying party 
  knows they understand that.
<kimhd> That they recognize it. That is valid accreditation body 
  is fine. But then, I guess. The interesting thing here is that we 
  can trace it back further so that
<kimhd> You know, if there were entities acting on behalf of some 
  other organization or even just individuals within an 
  organization, it does provide sort of this more fine grained 
  ability to audit.
<kimhd> So, I mean, at the same time, assuming that those 
  verifiable traceable verifiable credentials exist does sound like
<kimhd> Possibly scope creep in something that we don't want to
<kimhd> Have a dependency on. So I think that's important 
  clarification, Anthony in Anthony's on the call. He missed the 
  announcement in the excitement of of everyone acknowledging His 
  co chair edition. So I wanted to welcome Anthony again and 
  welcome him as Co chair.
<kimhd> So Anthony. Oh, I was wondering if you could talk. You 
  had mentioned the accreditation use case. I'm curious for your 
  responses to this.
<anthonyfcamilleri> Yeah, so I mean I'm just going to mention two 
  things, for the moment, because actually I like to found quite a 
  bit like Nate here in the sense that I have seen both model and 
  the wild. So for example, the
<anthonyfcamilleri> MC use case in Europe which Louise 
  representing here is actually designing of the verifiable 
  credential for accreditation standards and that's something which 
  I assume they might be able to contribute to the group. On the 
  other hand,
<anthonyfcamilleri> On the other hand, we also have yeah all 
  sorts of registries. They're ranging from national registries to 
  private one such as let's say the triple accreditation of 
  business degrees, etc, etc. And I think we would need a way to 
  represent all of these
<anthonyfcamilleri> Generally, I would say that we may be 
  wouldn't want to do anything overly fancy where we would be 
  saying, for example.
<anthonyfcamilleri> Proving within a verifiable credential that 
  an issue or has an accreditation that we might let the or at 
  least up first always linked to a registry.
<anthonyfcamilleri> But if that registry. Let's say it's a dumb 
  registry, or is the registry or verifiable credentials. I think 
  we probably could support that with the same metadata fields.
<kimhd> With. With. I'm sorry, with what
<anthonyfcamilleri> The metadata fields. Yeah. So basically i 
  mean i i don't see this being too complicated in the sense that 
  if you're thinking about accreditation, you're basically saying
<anthonyfcamilleri> Institution or program is accredited by a is 
  accredited for and you are I have proof of that registration from 
  some registry.
<kimhd> Right, and I think Carrie calls out a really good point 
  here. The. Okay, so there's these two separate use cases, yes, 
  we're seeing them both in the wild and Kerry mentioned, we need 
  to make sure there's
<kimhd> Issues and inspectors need to know the difference. That 
  part is key. I think to call out in this document curious or 
  anything as stuff you good comments for me. Is there anything 
  else you want to speak to
<kerri_lemoie> Know, no, but I do think there's a lot of there 
  would be confusion about this and I was really glad that Nate 
  brought this up because sometimes situations may need one. I mean 
  both may need, you know, one or the other. Right. So we do want 
  to be really clear. I think
<kimhd> Yeah, I like that. I want to capture that in the issue 
  and then actually Simone. A. Can I have you speak to the EBS 
  silence that you added
<kimhd> See, let me let me pull that up in the meantime.
<kimhd> Well, it's not coming up. Okay. It's just taking a while 
  to load.
<kimhd> Okay, so we'll come back to that. I think those are 
  important points to capture. I think I was also oh if she's a 
  meeting.
<kimhd> I understand.
<kimhd> Let's see. I was also curious to find out.
<kimhd> Yeah.
<larinyo> Yeah, we may I
<larinyo> Can share my screen. But now, not Commission my screen.
<kimhd> Oh, yes. If not, let me know, because I have the site up 
  as well.
<larinyo> Okay, so I can you should give me some rights me
<larinyo> I'm not sure if somebody was was going to talk about 
  this, but
<larinyo> Just what I can share is just what does one installed 
  is what we are implementing a PCI
<kimhd> Yeah, so be great. And actually, I don't know how to 
  change permissions during the call. I might have to do it 
  afterwards. But I'll share my screen, which is like this.
<larinyo> Yeah, but they think that the
<larinyo> Okay, this is a public public site. And this is a the 
  documentation related to ABC and
<larinyo> Disney ABC addition to that we have made.
<larinyo> The greater impact about governance and about the 
  points that D'Antoni also talk about about how
<larinyo> The one legal entity and the concert or city. Sure, and 
  how the, what we call the great session body that's the one that 
  will prove the legal entity that question or issue which will 
  request to be registered into the Jersey Shore.
<larinyo> debilitation body will prove that on will issue, what 
  you call the accreditation credential to the educational 
  institution and all their correspondent the registry. So they 
  trusted the issue registered the retention registered and also 
  does a schema Registry will be involved into
<larinyo> The into the brief about the spectrum to everyone could 
  agree.
<larinyo> If I can. So I think that it would be better to share a 
  lattice commendation I can just make an export now and shared 
  with you. Kim, or just we can apply it to today. We have, as you 
  prefer.
<larinyo> I can do it now. All right.
<larinyo> Okay, so let me share my desktop.
<larinyo> Yes. Okay. So let me just try go back. Okay. Because I 
  think that the
<larinyo> There are at least three
<larinyo> Three sites are related to
<larinyo> Do a B CI.
<larinyo> The one that Simoni shirt is the one public available 
  butter relates to the specifications of ABC restaurant one and 
  there are also some medium space and that requires a free 
  account. The fee will login account there and you can get access 
  to some
<larinyo> The specifications between the internal feature length 
  that handles the public side, but this is what we have defined 
  here in episode two, and here
<larinyo> At the end, what would introduce its governance for 
  academic credentials. So first of all, some what we call the 
  accreditation body mass index is accreditation body is the one 
  that will then
<larinyo> Let education's delusions be registered into the tissue 
  registry. And for that, after
<larinyo> Check with Member States roles. If on success on 
  completion, completion the accreditation body will be issued that 
  accreditation credential and to the educational institution and 
  all the register will be updated.
<larinyo> Here he will have a more deeper view on how the use 
  case governance relates to the sexual identity.
<larinyo> Components or Trusted Registry and main actors. OK, so 
  the yours. Is it an SEO service. That's the like the Trusted 
  Registry accreditation. It's just a service that helps a natural 
  vessels legal entities to onboard on separate entity.
<larinyo> On here we have two different roles that are natural 
  personal level entity can adopt on the use case on the on the 
  inner workings from the promise use case medication.
<larinyo> That band then also these main actors for governance 
  are required and after that accreditation credential has been 
  issued.
<larinyo> And the educational institutions are and it to be, they 
  become transitions and they are intended to issue the specific 
  type of credentials, go to a concert. We can play with all these 
  things. So you can be atrocity sure for
<larinyo> Any kind of or specific level of integration or Justin.
<larinyo> Good degree.
<larinyo> On that. Okay.
<larinyo> I can export all this information so we can share how 
  all the details of how these things are done and how registered 
  relates to the to the to the role to the actors and so on. He got 
  help who can who can do it, of course.
<kimhd> Yeah, this is great. I just had a couple of questions. 
  Yeah. The, the schemas for this. Are they part of or they just 
  some EBS I schemas, are they
<kimhd> Sort of external
<larinyo> These are, in fact, our Eastern Europe as learning data 
  model.
<larinyo> That as you know
<larinyo> Today they are XML plus shadows shadows basis, but here 
  in a PCI, we are want to share realize it to Geo JSON.
<larinyo> Yeah yes project. So that's it, but it's it's not. 
  There's no other schema is the euro pass learning data model 
  things. The last name and phone him right
<larinyo> Now the model, I think.
<kimhd> Because I wanted to come back quickly to Adrian's earlier 
  question about, you know, use outset. First, I was looking at it 
  in several aspects of the model seemed
<kimhd> Nice. In general, but it does seem like this one is also 
  targeting education use cases, even if it can be
<kimhd> Even if it looks model. Why is Apple more broadly.
<kimhd> Are you, uh huh. Let's see. Well, that's something we can 
  come back to in general, I saw a good so I do like this. I think 
  we should capture this in, in, you know, sort of one of our 
  options as well.
<kimhd> Anthony. I like this proposal, the idea that we would say 
  a must requirement of referencing an accreditation record or
<kimhd> I didn't even know I think referencing accreditation 
  record. Does that sound like even a stronger requirement then say 
  what either CT DL or or Open Badges support because they're 
  they're sort of self claimed, I guess it would the what I'm 
  seeing there is that
<kimhd> You would say, well, at least in the Open Badges case, 
  you would say issuer make some claim about the issuer, but it's 
  not clear that that has any sort of
<kimhd> You know signature any sort of enforcement. Like, I think 
  it would be expected for the relying party to independently 
  verify that. So I think this must requirement might be even 
  higher bar.
<kimhd> Than what I'm seeing there.
<anthonyfcamilleri> A little bit biased here because I did spend 
  part of my professional career tracking down the poem it all 
  found it.
<anthonyfcamilleri> Kind of in after that exists. I mean, fake 
  accreditation bodies, the whole lot of thought I would think that
<anthonyfcamilleri> Accreditation records are only valuable if 
  their order to make the Lord is the ball. I think it's all public 
  registry, at least the URL for the accreditation record would it 
  should we be good base. Level per entry. I mean, I don't know any 
  reputable accreditation in public or private sector society, but 
  the records. So who is accredited somewhere on the computer. I 
  think you are is quite straightforward to do it, but I felt that 
  way and opinion from combined with special experience.
<kimhd> I wonder what the reality is, in the US, I should know 
  this. Probably, but you know, I don't know if those are public. 
  If anyone knows, be nice to add yourself to the queue.
<kimhd> Adrian is on the queue to ask about privacy of the 
  accreditation registry, which is probably related to what I'm 
  getting at. Adrian
<agropper> Yes, it's, it's exactly that and I have seen both. So 
  in the US case you have, for instance.
<agropper> The NPI number
<agropper> For physicians, which is publicly available.
<agropper> And you also have the DA number for physicians, which 
  is not publicly available, not because it's not public 
  information, but because it's part of a business model.
<agropper> That the government used in order to publish the DA 
  number registration. So I am extremely interested in, for 
  instance, what goes on in the European context or any of these 
  contexts as to this particular issue. It seems to be the same in 
  education. And I'm just wondering
<agropper> You know, the, the absence of Oracle's of public 
  Oracle's
<agropper> For accredited membership is a is a huge problem in 
  general. And I'm wondering if in education. This is part of the 
  problem. I'm sorry I don't attend these calls very often but
<agropper> To me turning access to the registry into a business 
  model seems suboptimal but maybe education is different than 
  medicine.
<kimhd> Yeah, these are good points. I mean,
<kimhd> Let's see. So I think obviously ideally in in my world, 
  these would all be public, I guess, worst case, even if it is 
  part of the business model and and relying parties would be 
  expected to have some relationship with the
<kimhd> Entity that makes it available is long. It is as long as 
  they're able to do that through link data, then that would 
  satisfy the
<kimhd> Requirements, you know, assuming that would, in that 
  case, that would be, you know, linked data that they would have 
  to then authenticate to get
<kimhd> Which seems kind of counter to the goals of this, but 
  maybe it works.
<kimhd> But yeah, I don't know what I don't know what the cases.
<kimhd> Kerri is the accreditation for the issue or the 
  credential. I thought it was for the or I'm not sure if you're 
  asking, in general, but I would think it's for the credit station 
  for the issuer to issue a category of credentials are sort of, 
  yeah. A type of setup type of credentials.
<kerri_lemoie> You know I am. I want to clarify a little bit here 
  is, um, the CT dl and the accreditation is
<kerri_lemoie> Is for the credit accrediting organization, not 
  necessarily the issuing organization because with CCL they can be 
  separate.
<kerri_lemoie> In Open Badges the accreditation the issuer and 
  the program is the same right assumes that the issuer and the 
  credential creator
<kerri_lemoie> Is the same organization, there's no separation 
  between the two. So I think there's a difference between 
  accrediting who creates the credential who creates the school or 
  the program music school to say there.
<kerri_lemoie> Or is the actual issuer being accredited
<kerri_lemoie> So for an example, there is I use this one quite a 
  bit is the American Red Cross, but they have one CPR program.
<kerri_lemoie> They
<kerri_lemoie> Don't know if you would call it accredited, but 
  they sort of endorsed right local deliver new educators on that 
  program.
<kerri_lemoie> And so, what would that be in this credential. If 
  someone were to get a first aid credential or CPR credential from 
  their local school, but it was an American Red Cross, what would 
  the accreditation, be they may not be the best example but that's 
  what I had at the top of my head.
<kimhd> These are really good points. And I think that this is an 
  example of, I think, with the accreditation are all this 
  conversation is pointing to. We'll just have to be very specific 
  about which use cases are in scope in
<kimhd> Ideally, you know, not locked out certain use certain use 
  cases as well.
<kimhd> I think it's even more complicated than I had originally 
  thought which I already knew is complicated. Let me see if 
  there's any discussion to anyone else have anything to add. I see 
  some conversations on the in the chat.
<kimhd> Brent
<brent shambaugh> seems like an obvious question, but
<brent shambaugh> I'll ask it why
<brent shambaugh> Why is there emphasis specific use cases over 
  others. Are you trying to is it about the vocabulary that you're 
  concerned with not the underlying mechanics.
<kimhd> Right, I think it's less about the vocabulary. Then, so I 
  think it's just a huge space to navigate and especially when we 
  talk about certain framework, or like schema.org. For example, 
  when we talk about using schema.org terms in some way versus the 
  other.
<kimhd> And then we talked about the idea of needing to add terms 
  to it. We just have to be very specific to make sure we're 
  sketching out which use cases, we want to address because that in 
  some cases will argue for one approach versus the other. And it's 
  basically like
<kimhd> We don't want to over target one approach.
<kimhd> And, you know, sort of make up a solution in the absence 
  of requirements.
<kimhd> You know data model mapped to the different you know 
  frameworks that we're trying to use here most efficiently and 
  ideally in the most forward looking way. And I think also 
  capturing the use cases helps call out like if there's any you 
  know if there are any shortcomings or oversights in the use 
  cases, then it's easier for people to say like, Oh, you're 
  overlooking this or that. So that's my take on it.
<kimhd> Keith, you're up.
<keith_kowal> Yeah, I guess I'm just trying to think through this 
  conversation. I'm just trying to think more about the use case 
  conversation like
<keith_kowal> You know, I've handed I've shown them my degree or 
  my education credentials and job context. Many times, but I don't 
  think they ever check if they're accredited institution is 
  accredited
<keith_kowal> I've also applied for like masters degrees. I don't 
  think they ever checked it my degrees were credit, I, I 
  understand certain like if I was applying to be an engineer with 
  the professional engineering association or something.
<keith_kowal> They would check this accredited certain 
  certifications, they would check it, maybe they would check if it 
  was a credit or not, but I'm just trying to understand this use 
  case in the US context about when
<keith_kowal> When organizations really want to make sure that 
  you're issuing institution is accredited. I just because I think 
  that would help the conversation to kind of really lock down some 
  different use cases.
<kimhd> Yeah, I have some thoughts on that, please. Other people 
  add yourself to the
<kimhd> The idea of the you know the smaller credentials and 
  competencies gained along the way. And, you know, maybe they 
  should be checking the accreditation. So I when I lived in 
  California. Okay, so this is an example where
<kimhd> I probably shouldn't talk about this but I applied for a 
  job because I lived in California. I was able to see the 
  background check, Ronnie. They weren't able to confirm anything I 
  said about myself, but I got the job anyway so
<kimhd> You know, in this case, I, I like to think that I was, 
  you know, I was honest about everything. I said, but it's just 
  really, you know, there is a lot of fraud in
<kimhd> You know, in education, like it happens. Someone at MIT. 
  One of the MIT administrators
<kimhd> Lied about having a doctorate like it happens all the 
  time. So, the stakes are very different, but so there's the the 
  negative impact side but then I think there's also the positive 
  one of saying like, you know, if someone without
<kimhd> You know, fancy degree claim can instead, you know, prove 
  all these individual competencies that make them eligible for a 
  job and if the relying parties have trust in that process, then 
  we're opening up new pathways. So those are two
<kimhd> Two paths. I was thinking of Adrian. I think you're up 
  next.
<agropper> Right, so this is this was kind of my point earlier 
  about, it's easier to understand and pick between these models. 
  If you do it from the point of view of audit.
<agropper> Because the the audit makes the, the whole process 
  work because the audits are statistical and so as long as the 
  credential is expensive and, you know, education and 
  credentialing is expensive, then the parties are loads to be 
  audited.
<agropper> Because if they're caught even once.
<agropper> They, you know, they, they lose a lot of value, the 
  signers, you know, the notary's the doctor. So, I think this is 
  the general solution in the world is what I'm saying is to deal 
  with it as a probabilistic audit.
<agropper> Rather than trying to decide, in which case is 
  something sensitive because you're going to be the
<agropper> The admissions director at MIT and in other cases it 
  doesn't matter.
<kimhd> Everything Anthony, I think you're up next.
<anthonyfcamilleri> I just wanted to share a few different 
  examples of use cases since it was asked, are so a couple of 
  different ones. So first of all, in Europe, if you take any 
  degree us nationally, we actually need to verify accreditation. 
  It's basically a I'm simplifying, but it's basically legislation.
<anthonyfcamilleri> A second example, if you take an MBA, the 
  gold standard of MBAs globally is something which is called the 
  triple accredited, which means you're accredited by the atheists 
  be accredited by acquisition. I'm forgetting what the third 
  organization is
<anthonyfcamilleri> That I think there's three or 400 MBA schools 
  globally that are listed. And basically, if you're from a triple 
  A credit in business school.
<anthonyfcamilleri> You, you know, you get access to the top jobs 
  now maybe the first 50 schools on that list are, you know, 
  globally renowned browns.
<anthonyfcamilleri> The 350 that are under it, you probably would 
  be wanting to highlight to your employer that your school is 
  triple accredited as you're going
<anthonyfcamilleri> I'm a third example which is it's a 
  completely different is what we come into the MOOC platforms and
<anthonyfcamilleri> That there are various kinds of thing MOOC 
  accreditation going around everything from inclusion within 
  something like Coursera to
<anthonyfcamilleri> Our the excellence type moves in Europe, and 
  there's a few other they know about. And again, they would look 
  at the big number of MOOCs out there.
<anthonyfcamilleri> You also might want to show that. Listen, 
  your movie came from some sort of accreditation on a local one 
  very, very last example here, we also have plenty of examples of 
  lengthy
<anthonyfcamilleri> Employers for will accept to graduates was 
  certainly a barely vocational qualifications, if it comes from 
  school that have a credit have received certain types of 
  accreditation.
<anthonyfcamilleri> From business chambers. And again, if you're 
  showing this all your then slowly just basic needs a lot of 
  administration, all the way through to verify this stuff 
  manually.
<kimhd> Thank you. Anthony and I think to Keats point this 
  probably does try to the idea of making sure our use cases are 
  pushed through even further. So, you know, use cases in the sense 
  of
<kimhd> Instead of expressing it just, you know, relying party 
  wants to verify
<kimhd> A issuer has blah accreditation push it back even further 
  to, you know, some of the precise scenarios Anthony's talking 
  about Keith Europe.
<keith_kowal> Yeah, I think those are great scenarios. And I 
  think the question for me is then for whatever mechanism that we 
  come up with for this.
<keith_kowal> How you know I think I always look at it. How can 
  it be ingested in a very automated way. So maybe to use your, 
  your grading MBA example.
<keith_kowal> You know I I submit a job with an i have my MBA as 
  part of my resume.
<keith_kowal> How can that just pop up in the recruiters window 
  that this is an accredited institution because I would not expect 
  to that recruiter who's looking at 50 applications that day.
<keith_kowal> Is going to go digging into every institution or, 
  you know, I think where I kind of stumbled on CD TL I don't know 
  they're gonna go to CDs to page and read about the accreditation 
  or phone the creditor
<keith_kowal> I don't think. And if it's done through a 
  verifiable credential, then I guess, also, like, how would we 
  ingest that an automated way so it's it's displayed in a very 
  transparent way to the recruiter, who, again, is looking at 50 
  applications that day.
<kimhd> If anyone wants to talk to that, please add yourself to 
  the queue.
<kimhd> I think, you know, my, my personal thoughts again. And is 
  that you know what credential CT DL has right now is a lot of the 
  raw material that we need. I think a lot of the pilots that T 
  three, for example, are working towards
<kimhd> Are sort of about, you know, so, so see HDL credential 
  engine registry, the data is exposed in a machine readable way.
<kimhd> I think that you're right like relying parties don't 
  necessarily know that that's there are to look for that or you 
  know someone with any other framework.
<kimhd> But I think that what we're what some pilots are talking 
  about is actually building the infrastructure to help make that 
  more readily available. So it's not even that they would be able 
  to
<kimhd> Inspect or confirm everything, but at least if there's 
  some amount of, you know, verification that they can get out of 
  the way in deeply inspect then then that's providing some amount 
  of verification
<kimhd> I think that, so. So yeah, I think the general answers. 
  What we're talking about more is building or not, not 
  specifically in scope of this this task force, but we're talking 
  about enabling people to build the tools that would allow them to 
  do that.
<kimhd> Let's see.
<kimhd> I see a few things in chat. Does anyone have anything 
  they want to add
<kimhd> On record.
<kimhd> Victoria verification process, time consuming complex. 
  Yes.
<kerri_lemoie> He cadences carry
<kimhd> Good.
<kerri_lemoie> Um, you know, I hear some great information coming 
  from me dress. We all have like these experiences and the 
  assumptions about what the use cases are
<kerri_lemoie> I think we have found in the past with you. 
  Education credentials that we come back ourselves into a corner 
  by not thinking of the full scenarios like not getting a full 
  scope.
<kerri_lemoie> And getting stuck there which is problematic for 
  adoption. Right. So I would suggest we try not to be an anecdotal 
  about what we're trying to come up with in any of these 
  discussions and that we actually try and do some research to 
  support what what is needed and not rush through it.
<kimhd> Yeah, and I think
<kimhd> To your point, Kerri, the goal of this group is is two 
  things, you know, we want to unblock pilots, so people can get 
  started right now, so I think
<kimhd> In some cases, I want to reflect that in the the modeling 
  document that we're working on. So I think, you know, maybe there 
  are certain use cases that are to comp too complex to put into 
  that but
<kimhd> In they would be follow up work, but I think, you know, 
  we conversion are schemas here. I think we want to enable pilots, 
  we want to test and learn, but we also want to set the 
  expectation that
<kimhd> You know, this is a task force in a community group. 
  These aren't standards yet, but we're trying to build up to 
  something that we might be able to recommend that group takes on 
  so
<kimhd> Let me see if we have any other comments or questions. I 
  think we're getting pretty close to time there's a lot of 
  information, a lot of ground that we covered that I wanted to 
  still into the accreditation issue.
<kimhd> That is going to take a little bit of time to sort of 
  assimilate that feedback but
<kimhd> I'll, I'll do that so that we can then kind of come up 
  with a more refined approach Adrian Europe.
<agropper> I have a question. As I understand it, schools, in 
  general, treat their credentials is a form of toxic waste in the 
  sense that they pay intermediaries in order to
<agropper> Handle the verification process rather than doing it 
  themselves. So to the extent that they're paying somebody else to 
  do this. That's why I use that analogy is this common in 
  education around the world, is it unique to the US and are we 
  trying to change this in some way.
<kimhd> I like this toxic waste.
<kimhd> Thing. Yes, national National Student Clearinghouse.
<kimhd> You know,
<kimhd> My understanding is
<kimhd> Is that. Well, definitely in the US that it that that 
  perception is correct.
<kimhd> I think that we are also trying to
<kimhd> You know chip away, or sort of enable trust enable
<kimhd> Visibility and audit stability into that Anthony, you're, 
  you're up.
<anthonyfcamilleri> Against all odds of that question from a 
  European perspective. And to be honest, we have every model 
  imaginable in Europe. So we've got some places like Norway to 
  actually have National Student clearing houses.
<anthonyfcamilleri> Are we've got other places like parts of the 
  UK and Ireland that the common practices to Solstice out to break 
  a company for verification
<anthonyfcamilleri> And we have countries where the institution 
  continues verifying on credentials and also where if the 
  institution closes your credential physically move any value. So 
  I think every model actually to send the while of the world.
<kimhd> And Victoria. You're at
<victoria_feng> Yeah, sure. So I want also share some experiences 
  we we find out when we have pitching to the schools and are we 
  talking to the dimensions. So like also back to the questions in 
  China. The process is also the same.
<victoria_feng> We always would like to have a third party acting 
  as agency to verify all the credentials also verifying the 
  schools. So the, the fact we find out is like
<victoria_feng> Schools doesn't want to take that risk to saying 
  I'm I am the issuer and also we're verifying that just take too 
  much.
<victoria_feng> Credibility of them as as a as a as a school so 
  everybody agree on a third party to do verification process so 
  they can get rid of this part of the credibility. I am just a 
  school
<victoria_feng> I'm capable of teaching I mission critical data. 
  So if you want to verify everything that just curious, or 
  parties, we do for everybody. So that is pretty much
<victoria_feng> A fair game. At this point, and also for us as 
  the service provider which add additional layer a party will be 
  on the process, but I think just based on
<victoria_feng> Our experiences. The third party at this point is 
  very hard to get rid of because all the service providers.
<victoria_feng> As a vendor is even us. We're not trusted by 
  agency, at least at this point now chargeable
<victoria_feng> By the government. So if even our technology 
  right now is ready to provide the kind of service can bring the 
  issuer's and verify our and also degree holders altogether.
<victoria_feng> But still the same thing. Like one institution, 
  trust your platform. But then another institution may not. So at 
  this point, just get rid of agencies, very, very hard.
<kimhd> Right, these are great points.
<kimhd> We are one minute away from time and this is a fantastic 
  conversation here today.
<kimhd> Thank you everyone for joining. And I guess the next 
  couple of weeks will be canceled for holidays, but it's been a 
  great year. Thank you everyone for your great for your 
  participation.
<kimhd> And looking forward to starting the New Year with our new 
  co chair Anthony and have a great holiday season, everyone.
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks, Kim. Thanks everybody.
<kerri_lemoie> Great holidays.
<maarten> Thanks.
<anthonyfcamilleri> Bye.
