<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Okay, let&apos;s get started. Today we&apos;re talking about accreditation and we&apos;ll start with the IP note, anyone can participate in these calls. However, all substantive contributors to any CC G work items must be members of the CCP with full IPR agreement signed</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And the link to join the credentials community group is available at this location and pasting into chat.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And before that, you would need to create a W three Web Account and the link to do that is here. It&apos;s free to join community groups. And lastly, the text of the W three C community contributor license agreement is available at this link that I&apos;ve pasted into IRC.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Called it these minutes in an audio recording of everything said on this call are archived at the CG meetings repo.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And we&apos;re not using the word, we&apos;re not using the IRC interface to queue and everything. And this call. Instead, you can you can use the raise hand feature.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And will call on you and informally, you can definitely type q plus in the chat and we&apos;ll get to you. We don&apos;t have that many people. Well, we have a team, but in general we don&apos;t have enough activity to really cause</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Problems or Q backups.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Okay, let&apos;s get to introductions in reintroductions</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; We see if there&apos;s anyone new on the call. If there&apos;s anyone new on the call that would like to introduce themselves, please just speak up.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And we could also. So, let me make sure I&apos;m not is. Can people hear me.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yes. Okay, great.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Sure. Perfect. I</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Would yeah and just wanted to make sure</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Okay, if no one knew I think let&apos;s move to reintroductions and Brent. I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve called on you yet for reintroductions, would you mind introducing yourself to the group.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;bshambaugh&gt; I&apos;m sort of observing right now. I guess I&apos;ve been around this community for a while in and out or past six, seven years. So I&apos;m interested in learning a little bit more about what you&apos;re up to.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Great, thank you. Brent.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Okay, let&apos;s go on to next part of the agenda. I&apos;m not sure if we have Anthony here yet. But I wanted to announce. We have a new co chair joining the group. And that&apos;s Anthony chemically airy.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And we&apos;re excited to have him join. He&apos;s been bringing a lot of expertise from working in verifiable credentials in the EDC I</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Framework and so he&apos;s been really active in helping to drive the agenda so far and push push forward work items so very excited to have him join us.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Okay, now let&apos;s move to the main topic which is accreditation and I want to start by saying that this is not any sort of very well researched presentation on it. I think the goal is that</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; We would want to. Well, let me let me bring up the issue to start with. So, and I&apos;ll share my screen as well.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So we had talked about</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; The idea of dealing with accreditation.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; As part of</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; As part of the modeling verifiable credentials for education spec.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So Anthony called out a couple of approaches. So trusted issuer lists VCs issued to organizations authorizing them to issue educational credentials trusted accreditation organization list. So, oh, there&apos;s a frowny face.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Huh oh that&apos;s a confused emoji. Okay. Um, let&apos;s see. So So Jeannie responded with some CD DL terms which were really useful.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I did a little poking around as well to see what are some different approaches that are used, and I wanted to do a presentation on it and this is more to get feedback from the community. See if there&apos;s an other approaches that I&apos;m not familiar with.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And we can talk about how to move forward this issue in the modeling, Doc.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So I&apos;m going to switch</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; To this presentation, I&apos;m hoping that you can see this</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Accreditation screen, speak up and let me know if not, and I&apos;ll reshare</div>
<div class="information">&lt;jim goodell&gt; Looks good. Okay.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Do you want to send the link again.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So I did want to start with a non edu use case that I was familiar with in terms of accreditation and that&apos;s used in the barefoot, that is using verifiable credentials decentralized identifiers and all the standards that we&apos;re working on.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And the example is is KYC or verification of individuals acting on behalf, an organization.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So the use case comes from a pilot between consensus you port in life. And I understand, actually, that I think it was sovereign did did something similar. So I think the ideas are</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Are similar I just did these worked on this or wrote this up before I was aware of that pilot. So the global legal entity identifier foundation or life.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; They issue legal entity identifiers going to get increasingly awkward with acronyms. So I apologize.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Which is a unique 20 digit identifier for companies and the idea is to use this to reduce costs complexity of business verification</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Specifically what this prototype focused on was the idea of combining these legal entity identifiers and verifiable credentials to centralize identifiers to enable</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Rapid verification of a person acting in an official role. So I have a link to the medium article that that this is based on</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; You can</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; Yeah so glad. I made a major announcement last Thursday, so that they&apos;re moving forward with the feeling I which is their verifiable LCI and starting in January.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; And it&apos;s going to be using verifiable credentials and they&apos;ve got a big budget for it.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; A couple of us have been engaged bike life to push this forward and I put a little note in the in the thing here that</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; The consensus you port PLC was one of five different PCs that they did under a partnership with Deloitte to help them basically explore the entire space.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; And then they just made their announcement on Thursday that they are going to move forward. They&apos;re not actually going to use any of those five networks, they did go</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; Through the consensus report they did something with last year, which uses quorum, they did something on sovereign that a couple of others.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; In the end, they decided to use carry for the to become their own root of trust, but the beautiful thing is they&apos;re going to be using be using standard verifiable credentials and that all begins. They&apos;re about to embark on a big</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; Open source development initiative.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; everything they&apos;re doing is going to be fully open source and they&apos;re going to start dumping a bunch of resources into it in a</div>
<div class="information">&lt;timothy ruff&gt; Few weeks, beginning in January.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So the idea here. The, the general flow is is the same. And so this is, you know, this is just an example I you know I say</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; This is an example of how verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers and all of this can be used in that in that framework so</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; The, the flow that was used in this prototype was that life accredits a local operating unit and then it that enables in that&apos;s a verifiable credential that allows it to issue le eyes so so these legal entities, then can issue role credentials to oh wait, let me see. Okay, sorry.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yeah, so, then those are issued to legal entities which are companies who then can issue role credentials to people acting and official roles. So that could be someone who is</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know, a corporate officer who can use the role credential to Sign and Submit regular regulatory filings.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So then regulators can view and verify the signatures of the submitted documents. So not only. I think the typical flow that we think are the typical like in game of verifiable credentials that we we sort of</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Show in use cases are just sort of focusing on this last verifiable credential but but these sorts of end and flows are really key to establishing the trust that we would need. And so this is sort of a good general accreditation example. Let me see if we ok so now coming on to CT DL.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I wanted to start with an example that was that Jeannie link to in terms of the the sort of</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; how you would approach accreditation and CCL so there&apos;s an example provided about a dental assisting certificate. And so what this is doing in most will see this in a friendlier graphical view, but it&apos;s basically saying</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know Santa Rosa Junior College.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Offers this dental assisting certificate and then it will we won&apos;t go to look at the graphical view, but we want to say various things about</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; About the you know the accreditation of the junior college, etc. So let&apos;s look at this view. So we&apos;re saying Santa Rosa Junior College.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Offers credential over here certificate rather we&apos;re calling it credential in our terms, but that&apos;s certificate and CT DL terms. This is the key lead here accredited by so there&apos;s a quality assurance organization, the name is American Dental Association and off over here as well. We have</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; We have this you know competency that&apos;s required. So, in this is just spelling out the RDF triples, and, you know, in full detail I included this in case it wasn&apos;t readable just given our experience with tiny fonts last time.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Um, let&apos;s see. The other thing that I wanted to</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; To call out. So Jeannie listed here.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Some terms from CT DL. So see terms of credits approves recognizes regulates revokes which seemed like a good</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; List of the kinds of terms that we need an accreditation.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And so this is actually this example this dental example is taken from here.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Also these action classes looked really useful.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; accredited by is definitely the most pertinent one</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And I thought that there is some. Let me see. Let&apos;s look at these actions real fast. Just looking at at Lluis&apos;s comment.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I&apos;m not sure if I see suspend se vocal we can we can come back to that that comment. So let&apos;s see.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So there&apos;s, there&apos;s that. The other example that I saw kind of in the wild, of what is being used is the Open Badges accreditation extension and this is an extension on the issuer</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And so this is the these cases that an issue wants to include detailed information about an accrediting organization as it pertains to the program or bad show</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; The previous stencil example, example that we saw in the Open Badges case. I actually didn&apos;t tailor this example to that but but instead of the way it&apos;s model and see DDL, you know, it would be issuer and then effectively you add this under the issuer type, but the</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; concepts are very similar. Um, let&apos;s see what else I think. Okay, so those are the main contact said I wanted to provide</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Um, any let me let me stop sharing for just a second. Come back to see if there&apos;s any comments or discussion if you do have comments.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; It&apos;s a good time to see pace. So we have a Q plus</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Okay, Adrian</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; I sorry I just came in a few minutes ago. But my question is, I&apos;m familiar with notaries and vaccination cards, where the verifiable credential is link for audit purposes to an accredited other party.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; Right, so the doctor that signs.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; The doctor that signs of vaccination card has to have a number that&apos;s published somewhere, presumably saying they&apos;re credited to do vaccinations a notary has a stamp that has a number that says they are accredited to notarized</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; A credential and I&apos;m curious whether either either of the two models you are talking about or both could be equally useful in those very common context, but they&apos;re not educational in any sense of the word.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yeah, that&apos;s a good question. I wonder if</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Let me see if we have a queue right now.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Let&apos;s see any hands raised.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Oh great, Nate. I was going to call on you to talk to your comment as well. So yes, Nate Europe.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; Yeah, so there&apos;s a couple different types of relationships in play. And then there&apos;s a few ways to describe those relationships in the life example we saw the relationship</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; The accrediting relationship saying I have credit this organization to be able to do something, expressed as a verifiable credential.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; That record would be portable and verifiable in the using similar mechanisms to the verifiable credentials ultimately issued by say educational institution.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; In the Open Badges and seek Adele examples. We have a few different processes that we&apos;re looking at. One is that</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; There&apos;s a organization college may be issuing verifiable credentials to students to recognize educational achievements, but this educational institution is accredited and they have an accredited, but that a creditor is not yet issuing verifiable portable</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; Records of that accreditation. So what we have in the Open Badges extension and in the CTV L vocabulary is the ability for an organization to describe. It&apos;s a creditor</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; This college is accredited by this, you know, Northwest body of</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; You know, creditors that</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; Has local trust within the system. And so as we think about accreditation. We need to make sure we don&apos;t mix up these two different types of things. And then also decide what we want to actually accomplish</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; Do we want to just allow our issuers to describe what organizations they are accredited by in the real world, so that you can</div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate otto (badgr/csky)&gt; Phone up the creditor and ask them about it or do we want to provide the mechanisms for accreditation to also be represented as verifiable credential alongside the sort of core verifiable credentials representing degrees competencies, etc.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Exactly. And I wonder if the</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Okay, so yeah. Anthony says ideally both. I was thinking that originally</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; From the framing of it that only one of them, which is not necessarily the navigate ability, all the way back to the original source of trust. But yes, ideally it would be both.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Asia. And you&apos;re right, we need to deal with audit. In either case, I think, you know, the using just the one, the idea of saying I am accredited by</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; X where you know some relying party or verifying party knows they understand that.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; That they recognize it. That is valid accreditation body is fine. But then, I guess. The interesting thing here is that we can trace it back further so that</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know, if there were entities acting on behalf of some other organization or even just individuals within an organization, it does provide sort of this more fine grained ability to audit.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So, I mean, at the same time, assuming that those verifiable traceable verifiable credentials exist does sound like</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Possibly scope creep in something that we don&apos;t want to</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Have a dependency on. So I think that&apos;s important clarification, Anthony in Anthony&apos;s on the call. He missed the announcement in the excitement of of everyone acknowledging His co chair edition. So I wanted to welcome Anthony again and welcome him as Co chair.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; So Anthony. Oh, I was wondering if you could talk. You had mentioned the accreditation use case. I&apos;m curious for your responses to this.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Yeah, so I mean I&apos;m just going to mention two things, for the moment, because actually I like to found quite a bit like Nate here in the sense that I have seen both model and the wild. So for example, the</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; MC use case in Europe which Louise representing here is actually designing of the verifiable credential for accreditation standards and that&apos;s something which I assume they might be able to contribute to the group. On the other hand,</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; On the other hand, we also have yeah all sorts of registries. They&apos;re ranging from national registries to private one such as let&apos;s say the triple accreditation of business degrees, etc, etc. And I think we would need a way to represent all of these</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Generally, I would say that we may be wouldn&apos;t want to do anything overly fancy where we would be saying, for example.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Proving within a verifiable credential that an issue or has an accreditation that we might let the or at least up first always linked to a registry.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; But if that registry. Let&apos;s say it&apos;s a dumb registry, or is the registry or verifiable credentials. I think we probably could support that with the same metadata fields.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; With. With. I&apos;m sorry, with what</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; The metadata fields. Yeah. So basically i mean i i don&apos;t see this being too complicated in the sense that if you&apos;re thinking about accreditation, you&apos;re basically saying</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Institution or program is accredited by a is accredited for and you are I have proof of that registration from some registry.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Right, and I think Carrie calls out a really good point here. The. Okay, so there&apos;s these two separate use cases, yes, we&apos;re seeing them both in the wild and Kerry mentioned, we need to make sure there&apos;s</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Issues and inspectors need to know the difference. That part is key. I think to call out in this document curious or anything as stuff you good comments for me. Is there anything else you want to speak to</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; Know, no, but I do think there&apos;s a lot of there would be confusion about this and I was really glad that Nate brought this up because sometimes situations may need one. I mean both may need, you know, one or the other. Right. So we do want to be really clear. I think</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yeah, I like that. I want to capture that in the issue and then actually Simone. A. Can I have you speak to the EBS silence that you added</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; See, let me let me pull that up in the meantime.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Well, it&apos;s not coming up. Okay. It&apos;s just taking a while to load.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Okay, so we&apos;ll come back to that. I think those are important points to capture. I think I was also oh if she&apos;s a meeting.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I understand.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Let&apos;s see. I was also curious to find out.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yeah.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Yeah, we may I</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Can share my screen. But now, not Commission my screen.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Oh, yes. If not, let me know, because I have the site up as well.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Okay, so I can you should give me some rights me</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; I&apos;m not sure if somebody was was going to talk about this, but</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Just what I can share is just what does one installed is what we are implementing a PCI</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yeah, so be great. And actually, I don&apos;t know how to change permissions during the call. I might have to do it afterwards. But I&apos;ll share my screen, which is like this.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Yeah, but they think that the</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Okay, this is a public public site. And this is a the documentation related to ABC and</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Disney ABC addition to that we have made.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; The greater impact about governance and about the points that D&apos;Antoni also talk about about how</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; The one legal entity and the concert or city. Sure, and how the, what we call the great session body that&apos;s the one that will prove the legal entity that question or issue which will request to be registered into the Jersey Shore.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; debilitation body will prove that on will issue, what you call the accreditation credential to the educational institution and all their correspondent the registry. So they trusted the issue registered the retention registered and also does a schema Registry will be involved into</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; The into the brief about the spectrum to everyone could agree.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; If I can. So I think that it would be better to share a lattice commendation I can just make an export now and shared with you. Kim, or just we can apply it to today. We have, as you prefer.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; I can do it now. All right.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Okay, so let me share my desktop.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Yes. Okay. So let me just try go back. Okay. Because I think that the</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; There are at least three</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Three sites are related to</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Do a B CI.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; The one that Simoni shirt is the one public available butter relates to the specifications of ABC restaurant one and there are also some medium space and that requires a free account. The fee will login account there and you can get access to some</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; The specifications between the internal feature length that handles the public side, but this is what we have defined here in episode two, and here</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; At the end, what would introduce its governance for academic credentials. So first of all, some what we call the accreditation body mass index is accreditation body is the one that will then</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Let education&apos;s delusions be registered into the tissue registry. And for that, after</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Check with Member States roles. If on success on completion, completion the accreditation body will be issued that accreditation credential and to the educational institution and all the register will be updated.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Here he will have a more deeper view on how the use case governance relates to the sexual identity.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Components or Trusted Registry and main actors. OK, so the yours. Is it an SEO service. That&apos;s the like the Trusted Registry accreditation. It&apos;s just a service that helps a natural vessels legal entities to onboard on separate entity.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; On here we have two different roles that are natural personal level entity can adopt on the use case on the on the inner workings from the promise use case medication.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; That band then also these main actors for governance are required and after that accreditation credential has been issued.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; And the educational institutions are and it to be, they become transitions and they are intended to issue the specific type of credentials, go to a concert. We can play with all these things. So you can be atrocity sure for</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Any kind of or specific level of integration or Justin.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Good degree.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; On that. Okay.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; I can export all this information so we can share how all the details of how these things are done and how registered relates to the to the to the role to the actors and so on. He got help who can who can do it, of course.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yeah, this is great. I just had a couple of questions. Yeah. The, the schemas for this. Are they part of or they just some EBS I schemas, are they</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Sort of external</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; These are, in fact, our Eastern Europe as learning data model.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; That as you know</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Today they are XML plus shadows shadows basis, but here in a PCI, we are want to share realize it to Geo JSON.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Yeah yes project. So that&apos;s it, but it&apos;s it&apos;s not. There&apos;s no other schema is the euro pass learning data model things. The last name and phone him right</div>
<div class="information">&lt;larinyo&gt; Now the model, I think.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Because I wanted to come back quickly to Adrian&apos;s earlier question about, you know, use outset. First, I was looking at it in several aspects of the model seemed</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Nice. In general, but it does seem like this one is also targeting education use cases, even if it can be</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Even if it looks model. Why is Apple more broadly.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Are you, uh huh. Let&apos;s see. Well, that&apos;s something we can come back to in general, I saw a good so I do like this. I think we should capture this in, in, you know, sort of one of our options as well.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Anthony. I like this proposal, the idea that we would say a must requirement of referencing an accreditation record or</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I didn&apos;t even know I think referencing accreditation record. Does that sound like even a stronger requirement then say what either CT DL or or Open Badges support because they&apos;re they&apos;re sort of self claimed, I guess it would the what I&apos;m seeing there is that</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You would say, well, at least in the Open Badges case, you would say issuer make some claim about the issuer, but it&apos;s not clear that that has any sort of</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know signature any sort of enforcement. Like, I think it would be expected for the relying party to independently verify that. So I think this must requirement might be even higher bar.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Than what I&apos;m seeing there.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; A little bit biased here because I did spend part of my professional career tracking down the poem it all found it.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Kind of in after that exists. I mean, fake accreditation bodies, the whole lot of thought I would think that</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Accreditation records are only valuable if their order to make the Lord is the ball. I think it&apos;s all public registry, at least the URL for the accreditation record would it should we be good base. Level per entry. I mean, I don&apos;t know any reputable accreditation in public or private sector society, but the records. So who is accredited somewhere on the computer. I think you are is quite straightforward to do it, but I felt that way and opinion from combined with special experience.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I wonder what the reality is, in the US, I should know this. Probably, but you know, I don&apos;t know if those are public. If anyone knows, be nice to add yourself to the queue.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Adrian is on the queue to ask about privacy of the accreditation registry, which is probably related to what I&apos;m getting at. Adrian</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; Yes, it&apos;s, it&apos;s exactly that and I have seen both. So in the US case you have, for instance.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; The NPI number</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; For physicians, which is publicly available.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; And you also have the DA number for physicians, which is not publicly available, not because it&apos;s not public information, but because it&apos;s part of a business model.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; That the government used in order to publish the DA number registration. So I am extremely interested in, for instance, what goes on in the European context or any of these contexts as to this particular issue. It seems to be the same in education. And I&apos;m just wondering</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; You know, the, the absence of Oracle&apos;s of public Oracle&apos;s</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; For accredited membership is a is a huge problem in general. And I&apos;m wondering if in education. This is part of the problem. I&apos;m sorry I don&apos;t attend these calls very often but</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; To me turning access to the registry into a business model seems suboptimal but maybe education is different than medicine.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yeah, these are good points. I mean,</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Let&apos;s see. So I think obviously ideally in in my world, these would all be public, I guess, worst case, even if it is part of the business model and and relying parties would be expected to have some relationship with the</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Entity that makes it available is long. It is as long as they&apos;re able to do that through link data, then that would satisfy the</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Requirements, you know, assuming that would, in that case, that would be, you know, linked data that they would have to then authenticate to get</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Which seems kind of counter to the goals of this, but maybe it works.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; But yeah, I don&apos;t know what I don&apos;t know what the cases.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Kerri is the accreditation for the issue or the credential. I thought it was for the or I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;re asking, in general, but I would think it&apos;s for the credit station for the issuer to issue a category of credentials are sort of, yeah. A type of setup type of credentials.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; You know I am. I want to clarify a little bit here is, um, the CT dl and the accreditation is</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; Is for the credit accrediting organization, not necessarily the issuing organization because with CCL they can be separate.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; In Open Badges the accreditation the issuer and the program is the same right assumes that the issuer and the credential creator</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; Is the same organization, there&apos;s no separation between the two. So I think there&apos;s a difference between accrediting who creates the credential who creates the school or the program music school to say there.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; Or is the actual issuer being accredited</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; So for an example, there is I use this one quite a bit is the American Red Cross, but they have one CPR program.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; They</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; Don&apos;t know if you would call it accredited, but they sort of endorsed right local deliver new educators on that program.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; And so, what would that be in this credential. If someone were to get a first aid credential or CPR credential from their local school, but it was an American Red Cross, what would the accreditation, be they may not be the best example but that&apos;s what I had at the top of my head.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; These are really good points. And I think that this is an example of, I think, with the accreditation are all this conversation is pointing to. We&apos;ll just have to be very specific about which use cases are in scope in</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Ideally, you know, not locked out certain use certain use cases as well.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I think it&apos;s even more complicated than I had originally thought which I already knew is complicated. Let me see if there&apos;s any discussion to anyone else have anything to add. I see some conversations on the in the chat.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Brent</div>
<div class="information">&lt;brent shambaugh&gt; seems like an obvious question, but</div>
<div class="information">&lt;brent shambaugh&gt; I&apos;ll ask it why</div>
<div class="information">&lt;brent shambaugh&gt; Why is there emphasis specific use cases over others. Are you trying to is it about the vocabulary that you&apos;re concerned with not the underlying mechanics.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Right, I think it&apos;s less about the vocabulary. Then, so I think it&apos;s just a huge space to navigate and especially when we talk about certain framework, or like schema.org. For example, when we talk about using schema.org terms in some way versus the other.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And then we talked about the idea of needing to add terms to it. We just have to be very specific to make sure we&apos;re sketching out which use cases, we want to address because that in some cases will argue for one approach versus the other. And it&apos;s basically like</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; We don&apos;t want to over target one approach.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And, you know, sort of make up a solution in the absence of requirements.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know data model mapped to the different you know frameworks that we&apos;re trying to use here most efficiently and ideally in the most forward looking way. And I think also capturing the use cases helps call out like if there&apos;s any you know if there are any shortcomings or oversights in the use cases, then it&apos;s easier for people to say like, Oh, you&apos;re overlooking this or that. So that&apos;s my take on it.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Keith, you&apos;re up.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; Yeah, I guess I&apos;m just trying to think through this conversation. I&apos;m just trying to think more about the use case conversation like</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; You know, I&apos;ve handed I&apos;ve shown them my degree or my education credentials and job context. Many times, but I don&apos;t think they ever check if they&apos;re accredited institution is accredited</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; I&apos;ve also applied for like masters degrees. I don&apos;t think they ever checked it my degrees were credit, I, I understand certain like if I was applying to be an engineer with the professional engineering association or something.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; They would check this accredited certain certifications, they would check it, maybe they would check if it was a credit or not, but I&apos;m just trying to understand this use case in the US context about when</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; When organizations really want to make sure that you&apos;re issuing institution is accredited. I just because I think that would help the conversation to kind of really lock down some different use cases.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yeah, I have some thoughts on that, please. Other people add yourself to the</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; The idea of the you know the smaller credentials and competencies gained along the way. And, you know, maybe they should be checking the accreditation. So I when I lived in California. Okay, so this is an example where</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I probably shouldn&apos;t talk about this but I applied for a job because I lived in California. I was able to see the background check, Ronnie. They weren&apos;t able to confirm anything I said about myself, but I got the job anyway so</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know, in this case, I, I like to think that I was, you know, I was honest about everything. I said, but it&apos;s just really, you know, there is a lot of fraud in</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know, in education, like it happens. Someone at MIT. One of the MIT administrators</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Lied about having a doctorate like it happens all the time. So, the stakes are very different, but so there&apos;s the the negative impact side but then I think there&apos;s also the positive one of saying like, you know, if someone without</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know, fancy degree claim can instead, you know, prove all these individual competencies that make them eligible for a job and if the relying parties have trust in that process, then we&apos;re opening up new pathways. So those are two</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Two paths. I was thinking of Adrian. I think you&apos;re up next.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; Right, so this is this was kind of my point earlier about, it&apos;s easier to understand and pick between these models. If you do it from the point of view of audit.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; Because the the audit makes the, the whole process work because the audits are statistical and so as long as the credential is expensive and, you know, education and credentialing is expensive, then the parties are loads to be audited.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; Because if they&apos;re caught even once.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; They, you know, they, they lose a lot of value, the signers, you know, the notary&apos;s the doctor. So, I think this is the general solution in the world is what I&apos;m saying is to deal with it as a probabilistic audit.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; Rather than trying to decide, in which case is something sensitive because you&apos;re going to be the</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; The admissions director at MIT and in other cases it doesn&apos;t matter.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Everything Anthony, I think you&apos;re up next.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; I just wanted to share a few different examples of use cases since it was asked, are so a couple of different ones. So first of all, in Europe, if you take any degree us nationally, we actually need to verify accreditation. It&apos;s basically a I&apos;m simplifying, but it&apos;s basically legislation.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; A second example, if you take an MBA, the gold standard of MBAs globally is something which is called the triple accredited, which means you&apos;re accredited by the atheists be accredited by acquisition. I&apos;m forgetting what the third organization is</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; That I think there&apos;s three or 400 MBA schools globally that are listed. And basically, if you&apos;re from a triple A credit in business school.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; You, you know, you get access to the top jobs now maybe the first 50 schools on that list are, you know, globally renowned browns.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; The 350 that are under it, you probably would be wanting to highlight to your employer that your school is triple accredited as you&apos;re going</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; I&apos;m a third example which is it&apos;s a completely different is what we come into the MOOC platforms and</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; That there are various kinds of thing MOOC accreditation going around everything from inclusion within something like Coursera to</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Our the excellence type moves in Europe, and there&apos;s a few other they know about. And again, they would look at the big number of MOOCs out there.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; You also might want to show that. Listen, your movie came from some sort of accreditation on a local one very, very last example here, we also have plenty of examples of lengthy</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Employers for will accept to graduates was certainly a barely vocational qualifications, if it comes from school that have a credit have received certain types of accreditation.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; From business chambers. And again, if you&apos;re showing this all your then slowly just basic needs a lot of administration, all the way through to verify this stuff manually.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Thank you. Anthony and I think to Keats point this probably does try to the idea of making sure our use cases are pushed through even further. So, you know, use cases in the sense of</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Instead of expressing it just, you know, relying party wants to verify</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; A issuer has blah accreditation push it back even further to, you know, some of the precise scenarios Anthony&apos;s talking about Keith Europe.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; Yeah, I think those are great scenarios. And I think the question for me is then for whatever mechanism that we come up with for this.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; How you know I think I always look at it. How can it be ingested in a very automated way. So maybe to use your, your grading MBA example.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; You know I I submit a job with an i have my MBA as part of my resume.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; How can that just pop up in the recruiters window that this is an accredited institution because I would not expect to that recruiter who&apos;s looking at 50 applications that day.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; Is going to go digging into every institution or, you know, I think where I kind of stumbled on CD TL I don&apos;t know they&apos;re gonna go to CDs to page and read about the accreditation or phone the creditor</div>
<div class="information">&lt;keith_kowal&gt; I don&apos;t think. And if it&apos;s done through a verifiable credential, then I guess, also, like, how would we ingest that an automated way so it&apos;s it&apos;s displayed in a very transparent way to the recruiter, who, again, is looking at 50 applications that day.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; If anyone wants to talk to that, please add yourself to the queue.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I think, you know, my, my personal thoughts again. And is that you know what credential CT DL has right now is a lot of the raw material that we need. I think a lot of the pilots that T three, for example, are working towards</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Are sort of about, you know, so, so see HDL credential engine registry, the data is exposed in a machine readable way.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I think that you&apos;re right like relying parties don&apos;t necessarily know that that&apos;s there are to look for that or you know someone with any other framework.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; But I think that what we&apos;re what some pilots are talking about is actually building the infrastructure to help make that more readily available. So it&apos;s not even that they would be able to</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Inspect or confirm everything, but at least if there&apos;s some amount of, you know, verification that they can get out of the way in deeply inspect then then that&apos;s providing some amount of verification</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I think that, so. So yeah, I think the general answers. What we&apos;re talking about more is building or not, not specifically in scope of this this task force, but we&apos;re talking about enabling people to build the tools that would allow them to do that.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Let&apos;s see.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I see a few things in chat. Does anyone have anything they want to add</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; On record.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Victoria verification process, time consuming complex. Yes.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; He cadences carry</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Good.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; Um, you know, I hear some great information coming from me dress. We all have like these experiences and the assumptions about what the use cases are</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; I think we have found in the past with you. Education credentials that we come back ourselves into a corner by not thinking of the full scenarios like not getting a full scope.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kerri_lemoie&gt; And getting stuck there which is problematic for adoption. Right. So I would suggest we try not to be an anecdotal about what we&apos;re trying to come up with in any of these discussions and that we actually try and do some research to support what what is needed and not rush through it.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Yeah, and I think</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; To your point, Kerri, the goal of this group is is two things, you know, we want to unblock pilots, so people can get started right now, so I think</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; In some cases, I want to reflect that in the the modeling document that we&apos;re working on. So I think, you know, maybe there are certain use cases that are to comp too complex to put into that but</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; In they would be follow up work, but I think, you know, we conversion are schemas here. I think we want to enable pilots, we want to test and learn, but we also want to set the expectation that</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know, this is a task force in a community group. These aren&apos;t standards yet, but we&apos;re trying to build up to something that we might be able to recommend that group takes on so</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Let me see if we have any other comments or questions. I think we&apos;re getting pretty close to time there&apos;s a lot of information, a lot of ground that we covered that I wanted to still into the accreditation issue.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; That is going to take a little bit of time to sort of assimilate that feedback but</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I&apos;ll, I&apos;ll do that so that we can then kind of come up with a more refined approach Adrian Europe.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; I have a question. As I understand it, schools, in general, treat their credentials is a form of toxic waste in the sense that they pay intermediaries in order to</div>
<div class="information">&lt;agropper&gt; Handle the verification process rather than doing it themselves. So to the extent that they&apos;re paying somebody else to do this. That&apos;s why I use that analogy is this common in education around the world, is it unique to the US and are we trying to change this in some way.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I like this toxic waste.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Thing. Yes, national National Student Clearinghouse.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know,</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; My understanding is</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Is that. Well, definitely in the US that it that that perception is correct.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; I think that we are also trying to</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; You know chip away, or sort of enable trust enable</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; Visibility and audit stability into that Anthony, you&apos;re, you&apos;re up.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Against all odds of that question from a European perspective. And to be honest, we have every model imaginable in Europe. So we&apos;ve got some places like Norway to actually have National Student clearing houses.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; Are we&apos;ve got other places like parts of the UK and Ireland that the common practices to Solstice out to break a company for verification</div>
<div class="information">&lt;anthonyfcamilleri&gt; And we have countries where the institution continues verifying on credentials and also where if the institution closes your credential physically move any value. So I think every model actually to send the while of the world.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kimhd&gt; And Victoria. You&apos;re at</div>
<div class="information">&lt;victoria_feng&gt; Yeah, sure. So I want also share some experiences we we find out when we have pitching to the schools and are we talking to the dimensions. So like also back to the questions in China. The process is also the same.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;victoria_feng&gt; We always would like to have a third party acting as agency to verify all the credentials also verifying the schools. So the, the fact we find out is like</div>
<div class="information">&lt;victoria_feng&gt; Schools doesn&apos;t want to take that risk to saying I&apos;m I am the issuer and also we&apos;re verifying that just take too much.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;victoria_feng&gt; Credibility of them as as a as a as a school so everybody agree on a third party to do verification process so they can get rid of this part of the credibility. I am just a school</div>
<div class="information">&lt;victoria_feng&gt; I&apos;m capable of teaching I mission critical data. So if you want to verify everything that just curious, or parties, we do for everybody. So that is pretty much</div>
<div class="information">&lt;victoria_feng&gt; A fair game. At this point, and also for us as the service provider which add additional layer a party will be on the process, but I think just based on</div>
<div class="information">&lt;victoria_feng&gt; Our experiences. The third party at this point is very hard to get rid of because all the service providers.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;victoria_feng&gt; As a vendor is even us. We&apos;re not trusted by agency, at least at this point now chargeable</div>
