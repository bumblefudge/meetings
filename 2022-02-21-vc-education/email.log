  shift refreshing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   All.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So Carrie.
<kerri_lemoie> The new entry screen should help with audio
<kerri_lemoie> Hah! Phil
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Right exactly exactly I'm counting on the on 
  the transcriber all right Kari is is the audio being recorded.
Kerri Lemoie:  It is recording a started and transcription and 
  started to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay fantastic fantastic all right so I'm 
  going to I'm going to share screen before we get started actually 
  wait let's do the IP notifications.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  .
<pl> Thanks - had to restart bluetooth

Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right then let's let's jump into its let's 
  talk about handling of duplicate credentials here in GT Chad is 
  the link to the slide deck for those who want to follow along and 
  I'll also share screen.
Kerri Lemoie:  Sure I'll keep an eye on it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I've also carry or Simone a or somebody else 
  if I miss a cue place in chat please please let me know as I'm 
  presenting okay here we go thank you so much appreciate it all 
  right.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  .
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So everybody can see the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Mice.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Okay.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So topic of the call today is a seemingly 
  simple question of what do we do about duplicate credentials.

Topic: Handling of Duplicate Credentials (Issuer and Wallet Considerations)

Dmitri Zagidulin:  So we're going to talk about what is actually 
  duplicate credential it's more complicated than initially hoped 
  for we can talk about several scenarios that we've encountered in 
  deploying educational credentials to wallets we can talk about 
  the various ways to think about an educational credential and 
  we'll discuss so what does this mean for our data models for 
  issuing API and also how should wallets.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  .
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We as.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Unity agree on common ui/ux patterns when 
  dealing with duplicate credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay so here's a here's a trivial scenario for 
  you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A learner has a verifiable credentials saved 
  to their wallet.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They're now adding an identical VC for example 
  real real easy scenario to encounter example the DCC wallet 
  allows you to add credentials by scanning a QR code which 
  contains a full embedded credential in it right so for 
  credentials under 4,000 characters long.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  .
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thousand bytes you can fit the whole 
  credential in QR code so students scans the QR code it adds the 
  credential they now either accidentally or because they forgot 
  what the QR code contains scan it again.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   So.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The incoming credential it's from the same 
  static QR code it is byte for byte identical to the one already 
  saved.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  .
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Should the wallet do.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And we as a community as well as implementers 
  we all have to decide this question because it's it happens 
  fairly frequently.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For example the decision we went with the DCCC 
  wallet is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Because it's identical.
<pl> the downside of having identical credentials in the wallet?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You don't add it there's a message to the to 
  the learner that says hey not adding the credential you already 
  have one here to have one exactly like it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Question to think about for the group is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Are there any situations where.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You explicitly wants to add an identical 
  verify book or natural like by 4 B identical so that two copies 
  appear on the user's screen when they list the credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  My personal guess is now but it's worth 
  thinking about.
<pl> Multiple different backups?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay so this one's easy because the 
  credentials are identical now what about and this is what.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   What.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Did a lot of discussion among several Dev 
  teams and inspired to the topic of today's call.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What about if it's.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And mostly the same crew verifiable credential 
  but the dates are different so specifically we've got two or 
  three dates that are required by the VC data model so each 
  credentials verifiable credential will have one or more of these 
  days so each one has to be has to have an issuance date which for 
  those following along on the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  .
Dmitri Zagidulin:  VC working group.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1.0 And 1.1.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Call the field issuance date in 2.0 it will be 
  replaced it will be deprecated issuance date and it will be 
  replaced with a combination of valid from and date issued an 
  issue date.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Similarly VC data model.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Proposes and specifies an optional expiration 
  date.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And again in the VC 2.0 spec and working group 
  the intention is to rename to deprecate expiration date and 
  rename it valid until.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To prevent various ambiguous cases that have 
  come up.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In addition we have the proof section of 
  credentials and many proof mechanisms require a timestamp of when 
  that group proof was created so if you're doing BBS Plus or 
  LinkedIn proofs.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They often have a created timestamp so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right so this is just a different 
  definition of the current spec issuance date meaning.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It represents the date and the time the 
  credential becomes valid.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  .
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Firstly as far as I attack as far as it 
  effects the educational use case think about a diploma think 
  about a course completion credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We now have the sort of semantic question of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What should they show issuance date is it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The year that the you know the exact month or 
  day that the student graduated.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Or is it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  When the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  When the diploma is valid from right and those 
  could be slightly different that there could be a gap between 
  when the students graduated and the diploma is valid or perhaps 
  there's backdating such as those situations right so we need to 
  think about the semantics of the issuance date field.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  .
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Renamed valid from.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Similarly what does the proof that create a 
  timestamp mean so one way to think about.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Issuance date is the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Exact day time the learner graduated and proof 
  created can be thought of as a different time that the registrar 
  signed their diploma and again there could be about a gap student 
  graduate one day the registrar signed the diploma a week after.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So back to our topic what happens when a 
  learner has a verifiable credential in the wallet.
<kerri_lemoie> Unfortunately I think the transcriber has failed 
  because the recording stopped (and was restarted).
<kerri_lemoie> Is anyone able to transcribe the rest of the call?
<kerri_lemoie> Will let Dmitri finish thoughts and then open up 
  queue
<pl> I'll do it after I ask my questions
<pl> Kerri - existing open badges has an issued on field which 
  would be replaced by issuance date.
<pl> Dmitri - may want to consider using 2.0 changes in the OBv3 
  and CLRv2
<nate_otto_(badgr/csky)> OB issuedOn is equivalenet to the new VC 
  validFrom (rather than a created date)
<pl> Kerri - issued and awarded are often used interchangably. 
  Awarded may be when the transfers it to the recipieint.   Should 
  we add the phrase "duplicate" on an reissued credential that 
  isssued as an identical replacement. Used with Driver's Licenses
<pl> Messaging approach (dupllcate signifier)
<pl> What happens when email addresses change? Or DIDs change. 
  Should consider  guardianship.
<pl> I'm not getting audio connecte
<pl> Will rejoin
<kerri_lemoie> Good point Marty
<kerri_lemoie> Can they ever be truly identical since the proof 
  will always be different?
<pl> Dmitri - downside of multiple identical credentials?  
  Downside from storage perspective is nothing.
<pl> Dmitri - downside on the wallet is in the UI/UX and the user 
  sees multiple credentials in their inventory
<pl> Multiple issued credentials - issuers should keep track of 
  the issuance.
<pl> Previous comment was Uli's
<pl> David - what is the difference in the way credentials are 
  treated?  Are they considered the same or not? How does that 
  interact with processes that treat credentials.
<pl> Dmitri - next steps
<pl> Dmitri - we want to add these situations to our use cases 
  documents.  We want to mention in notiifications;  we want to 
  consider new information needed to be added to an existing 
  credential
<pl> Phil L. - get data from registrars on the true frequency of 
  issued credentials are changed or edited.
<pl> What are the reasons for reissuance in the DCC pilot? Dmitri 
  - narrow scope of pilot doesn't give a good representation of the 
  problem. It's very easy to reissue which may be a bad thing.
<pl> Kerri - we have a topic for credential refresh which will 
  allow us to return to this.

<pl> Use Cases Doc link - good recommendation to add platform to 
  the use case template.
<pl> Issues in github have been updated - some new information 
  present
<pl> Take a look at the issues and add your notes, comments and 
  perspectives on the one's your interested in.
