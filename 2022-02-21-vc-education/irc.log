[2022-02-21T16:08:44.032Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right then let's let's jump into its let's talk about handling of duplicate credentials here in GT Chad is the link to the slide deck for those who want to follow along and I'll also share screen.
[2022-02-21T16:09:00.543Z]	<Transcriber>	Kerri_Lemoie: Sure I'll keep an eye on it.
[2022-02-21T16:09:02.448Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I've also carry or Simone a or somebody else if I miss a cue place in chat please please let me know as I'm presenting okay here we go thank you so much appreciate it all right.
[2022-02-21T16:09:02.576Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: .
[2022-02-21T16:09:06.239Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So everybody can see the.
[2022-02-21T16:09:06.334Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  mice.
[2022-02-21T16:09:09.738Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I mean okay.
[2022-02-21T16:09:19.594Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So topic of the call today is a seemingly simple question of what do we do about duplicate credentials.

[2022-02-21T16:09:44.5Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	Topic: Handling of Duplicate Credentials (Issuer and Wallet Considerations)
[2022-02-21T16:09:50.788Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So we're going to talk about what is actually duplicate credential it's more complicated than initially hoped for we can talk about several scenarios that we've encountered in deploying educational credentials to wallets we can talk about the various ways to think about an educational credential and we'll discuss so what does this mean for our data models for issuing API and also how should wallets.
[2022-02-21T16:09:51.194Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: .
[2022-02-21T16:09:51.254Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We as.
[2022-02-21T16:10:00.036Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Unity agree on common ui/ux patterns when dealing with duplicate credentials.
[2022-02-21T16:10:04.494Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Okay so here's a here's a trivial scenario for you.
[2022-02-21T16:10:09.510Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: A learner has a verifiable credentials saved to their wallet.
[2022-02-21T16:10:36.038Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: They're now adding an identical VC for example real real easy scenario to encounter example the DCC wallet allows you to add credentials by scanning a QR code which contains a full embedded credential in it right so for credentials under 4,000 characters long.
[2022-02-21T16:10:36.186Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: .
[2022-02-21T16:10:52.333Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Thousand bytes you can fit the whole credential in QR code so students scans the QR code it adds the credential they now either accidentally or because they forgot what the QR code contains scan it again.
[2022-02-21T16:10:52.513Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  so.
[2022-02-21T16:11:00.532Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The incoming credential it's from the same static QR code it is byte for byte identical to the one already saved.
[2022-02-21T16:11:00.603Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: .
[2022-02-21T16:11:02.967Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Should the wallet do.
[2022-02-21T16:11:14.588Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And we as a community as well as implementers we all have to decide this question because it's it happens fairly frequently.
[2022-02-21T16:11:21.529Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: For example the decision we went with the DCCC wallet is.
[2022-02-21T16:11:24.468Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Because it's identical.
[2022-02-21T16:11:29.745Z]	<PL>	the downside of having identical credentials in the wallet?
[2022-02-21T16:11:35.622Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You don't add it there's a message to the to the learner that says hey not adding the credential you already have one here to have one exactly like it.
[2022-02-21T16:11:40.055Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Question to think about for the group is.
[2022-02-21T16:11:45.003Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Are there any situations where.
[2022-02-21T16:11:56.702Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You explicitly wants to add an identical verify book or natural like by 4 B identical so that two copies appear on the user's screen when they list the credentials.
[2022-02-21T16:12:00.550Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: My personal guess is now but it's worth thinking about.
[2022-02-21T16:12:04.683Z]	<PL>	Multiple different backups?
[2022-02-21T16:12:11.540Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Okay so this one's easy because the credentials are identical now what about and this is what.
[2022-02-21T16:12:11.673Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  what.
[2022-02-21T16:12:19.075Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Did a lot of discussion among several Dev teams and inspired to the topic of today's call.
[2022-02-21T16:12:23.479Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What about if it's.
[2022-02-21T16:12:52.300Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And mostly the same crew verifiable credential but the dates are different so specifically we've got two or three dates that are required by the VC data model so each credentials verifiable credential will have one or more of these days so each one has to be has to have an issuance date which for those following along on the.
[2022-02-21T16:12:52.444Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: .
[2022-02-21T16:12:56.991Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: VC working group.
[2022-02-21T16:13:00.971Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1.0 and 1.1.
[2022-02-21T16:13:16.607Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Call the field issuance date in 2.0 it will be replaced it will be deprecated issuance date and it will be replaced with a combination of valid from and date issued an issue date.
[2022-02-21T16:13:22.479Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Similarly VC data model.
[2022-02-21T16:13:28.502Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Proposes and specifies an optional expiration date.
[2022-02-21T16:13:39.586Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And again in the VC 2.0 spec and working group the intention is to rename to deprecate expiration date and rename it valid until.
[2022-02-21T16:13:44.537Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To prevent various ambiguous cases that have come up.
[2022-02-21T16:14:04.871Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In addition we have the proof section of credentials and many proof mechanisms require a timestamp of when that group proof was created so if you're doing BBS Plus or LinkedIn proofs.
[2022-02-21T16:14:09.004Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: They often have a created timestamp so.
[2022-02-21T16:14:18.078Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right so this is just a different definition of the current spec issuance date meaning.
[2022-02-21T16:14:25.020Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It represents the date and the time the credential becomes valid.
[2022-02-21T16:14:26.960Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So.
[2022-02-21T16:14:27.023Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: .
[2022-02-21T16:14:41.667Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Firstly as far as I attack as far as it effects the educational use case think about a diploma think about a course completion credential.
[2022-02-21T16:14:49.502Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We now have the sort of semantic question of.
[2022-02-21T16:14:53.981Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What should they show in state B is it.
[2022-02-21T16:15:02.494Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The year that the you know the exact month or day that the student graduated.
[2022-02-21T16:15:04.956Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Or is it.
[2022-02-21T16:15:07.966Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: When the.
[2022-02-21T16:15:11.106Z]	<Phil_Barker>	s/in state B/issuance date
[2022-02-21T16:15:24.746Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: When the diploma is valid from right and those could be slightly different that there could be a gap between when the students graduated and the diploma is valid or perhaps there's backdating such as those situations right so we need to think about the semantics of the issuance date field.
[2022-02-21T16:15:24.832Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: .
[2022-02-21T16:15:26.963Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Renamed valid from.
[2022-02-21T16:15:39.571Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Similarly what does the proof that create a timestamp mean so one way to think about.
[2022-02-21T16:15:44.481Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Issuance date is the.
[2022-02-21T16:16:03.052Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Exact day time the learner graduated and proof created can be thought of as a different time that the registrar signed their diploma and again there could be about a gap student graduate one day the registrar signed the diploma a week after.
[2022-02-21T16:16:12.033Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So back to our topic what happens when a learner has a verifiable credential in the wallet.

[2022-02-21T16:22:13.115Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	Unfortunately I think the transcriber has failed because the recording stopped (and was restarted).
[2022-02-21T16:22:28.848Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	Is anyone able to transcribe the rest of the call?

[2022-02-21T16:23:50.066Z]	<Phil_Barker>	Q+ what about licences, which may be renewed without invalidating the previous but isn't just a "copy" of the existing?
[2022-02-21T16:27:30.009Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	Will let Dmitri finish thoughts and then open up queue

[2022-02-21T16:36:33.825Z]	<PL>	Kerri - existing open badges has an issued on field which would be replaced by issuance date.
[2022-02-21T16:37:05.529Z]	<PL>	Dmitri - may want to consider using 2.0 changes in the OBv3 and CLRv2
[2022-02-21T16:37:20.288Z]	<Nate_Otto_(Badgr/CSky)>	OB issuedOn is equivalenet to the new VC validFrom (rather than a created date)
[2022-02-21T16:38:31.230Z]	<PL>	Kerri - issued and awarded are often used interchangably. Awarded may be when the transfers it to the recipieint.   Should we add the phrase "duplicate" on an reissued credential that isssued as an identical replacement. Used with Driver's Licenses
[2022-02-21T16:38:53.489Z]	<PL>	Messaging approach (dupllcate signifier)
[2022-02-21T16:39:27.516Z]	<PL>	What happens when email addresses change? Or DIDs change. Should consider  guardianship.

[2022-02-21T16:46:03.687Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	Can they ever be truly identical since the proof will always be different?

[00:00:00.130] - Speaker 1
Issuance date, a later or an earlier one, or it has a proof created timestamp that's different. So meaning same diploma was signed at slightly different times by the Registrar. What do we do about this? Right? In the identical case it was easy.

[00:00:24.910] - Speaker 1
It is identical. You can do a trivial comparison and just skip adding it because it already has it. Here. You need to compare most of the fields in the Credential except for these timestamps. Should wallets flag this occurrence, this situation to their user?

[00:00:51.810] - Speaker 1
So after a lot of discussion in the DCC wallet, we ended up having the wallet compare all of the fields in the credentials except for the proof section and the dates, and prompt the user that hey, this is the same as an existing Credential just issued at a different time. Do you want to add it or do you want to skip it because maybe you did it by accident?

[00:01:23.650] - Speaker 1
So one question is what should the wallet do? And do we as a community want to standardize the policy, the UI recommendations? A separate question is what should the issuer do? And we'll talk about caching and the conceptual model behind issuing or reissuing the Verifiable credentials. But these are questions to think about how should the issue behave?

[00:01:51.030] - Speaker 1
How should the wallet behave? Verifiable credential the same, just the dates differ.

[00:01:59.210] - Speaker 1
In the real world we have two different consensual models for same credential, different date. We have this notion of from computer science. We have this notion of Singleton object or Singleton credential, meaning only one can exist at a time or with credentials. Only one valid one can exist at a time. So we can consider, for example, United States passport.

[00:02:27.140] - Speaker 1
And I imagine other countries have very similar semantics as a Singleton credential, meaning only one valid one can exist at a time. And when you lose your passport or you get it renewed because it expired or for whatever reason you need to renew, it got damaged part of the issuance process. You have to send in the previous one and it gets revoked, it gets invalidated. So at any point you have one copy of the passport in your hand that is valid, all the previous ones are Invalid and the lost ones are also Invalid because it is a physical object. The issuer can enforce their policy of this is a Singleton credential via multiple things like giving it a different number, having different Identifier on the chip, on their RFID chip, that they get scanned, all sorts of mechanism available to them.

[00:03:35.250] - Speaker 1
They also have obviously they sure have databases that firefighters can compare against to check in real time whether something had been expired or put on a do not fly list or whatever. Right? So that's one extreme. Definitely Singleton credential. The other way to think about it, about the various timestamps on a Verifiable Credential is our other familiar situation of you request a copy of the transcript from a Registrar.

[00:04:08.620] - Speaker 1
Right? So here transcripts sample student record from UC San Diego. And regardless of when the learner graduated or when they completed the course, the Credential itself has a metadata time stamp date and time printed. And that obviously can be separate. And more importantly, let's say the student is applying to multiple institutions and they need multiple copies of this.

[00:04:43.730] - Speaker 1
So they get a Fax from the Registrar one week and then two weeks later they get another Fax which will have a separate date and time printed. How do we map this to our verifiable credentials? Do we consider a single VC in a learner model.

[00:05:01.570] - Speaker 1
In the learner's wallet, more like the passport, or more like a printout or an instance of a Credential, even though it's the same the student graduated once. Contents are different, but the metadata of the Credential they didn't printed or proof Dot created is different.

[00:05:31.410] - Speaker 1
We want to have a discussion as a community on what to do, and I'm going to present the questions, and then we'll launch into discussion just so that we have all of the topics primed in our mind. So we want to discuss what our recommendations are as a community. But of course, in most of the cases, it's the issuers. It's the learning establishments themselves or the governments that will dictate policy on how they want you to think about this verifiable Credential, whether it's a single time or not. And so on our end, we need to think about how can we denote that possibly in the data model so that the wallet looks at a verifiable Credential and says, okay, this is the passport style Singleton, I know what to do.

[00:06:19.780] - Speaker 1
I'm going to prompt the user to warn them, be like this, incoming Credential obsolete the previous one, we're going to replace it, or I'm just not going to add it, right? Whatever the policy is dictated by the issue. So this has implications on the data model of our credentials, and it has implications on the APIs and the protocols. Meaning perhaps we need to expand our issue API to say I'm requesting a reissue because I lost the previous one, or I'm requesting a reissue because my Identifier changed, et cetera. Right?

[00:07:03.590] - Speaker 1
So there's implications on the data model, on issue behavior, and on Wallet UI recommendations, depending on what we come up with. Here's another example.

[00:07:20.390] - Speaker 1
This is on the subject of API implications.

[00:07:27.570] - Speaker 1
So what are some reasons that a student rather they should get multiple requests for VC to be issued? R1 easy one that we encounter all the time is the student lost their original wallet. Either their mobile phone got damaged or they uninstalled the app accidentally or whatever something happened to it. Their computer crashed data is very ephemeral. So they're trying to recover the Wallet and some Privacy preserving wallets do not allow for backups, or if they do, the person forgot their passphrase and they can't unencrypt it.

[00:08:05.740] - Speaker 1
They basically need another copy of the Credential, so no problem, right? Like, depending on the issue policy and the wallet architecture, they can do that. So they lost the original one. They're just requesting a new one. They sure will likely hand them the same identical one as previously, and that's it.

[00:08:27.360] - Speaker 1
Or depending on how the issue is implemented, they will have a slightly different proof created timestamp. Now, the situation is when a Credential has expired, and much like the passport, there is a refresh or reissue call on the protocol, and that requires a copy of the existing Credential, and then you get handed a new one with a later expiration date and obviously a later proof got created since it is physically being created in the future and I was interested in the protocol aspect of it, I recommend the other CCG work item gcapi specification and their exchange workflows and so we need to think about what should our caching recommendations be to issuers. Meaning here's a trivial example. If a learner is asking for the credential on the same day, just cash the same credential bite for bite and just return it to them. There's no need to update the proof that created or anything like that.

[00:09:46.950] - Speaker 1
Similarly, we need to think about the data model map affordances of how should they issue a signal that okay, I'm issuing you a new one.

[00:10:00.610] - Speaker 1
But you have to revoke the previous ones. So speaking of revoking a previous one, here's another situation for you. Again, Learner has a Verifiable credential. It hasn't expired yet and really the dates haven't changed. But now the issue has to rotate a key, either because it's their corporate policy. A lot of key and certificate policies require them to be rotated every X month, every year, whatever, or another unfortunate scenario, their signing key got compromised, got stolen, whatever. And they need to revoke the old key and they have a new key in there. Which means that depending on the situation, whether there's a planned upgrade, planned rotation, or an unplanned one doesn't mean that the previous credential in the previous key is Invalid. Or it could be that they should have multiple signing keys. And the first time Learner asked the credential, it was key A. And the second time they asked the issuer, signed it with key B. Both of them current keys, both of them in the issuers decentralized Identifier document. So now what does the wallet do? What should happen to the previous VC? Again, back to the concept of if it's a single stone style credential, does the wallet toss the previous one?

[00:11:47.660] - Speaker 1
Because of the implicit understanding that the previous one has been revoked, what should the UI look like? Hey, this is same issue. We validated against various trust registries. They're still an accredited University, but now they're signing with a different key. So you think about the UI implications. Also, the more we think about these questions, the question really of wallet inboxes or notifications, the ability of issuers to signal to the wallets, hey, we're going out of business or we change the signing key, or the previous one got compromised, whatever. Right? So we need to start talking and thinking about inboxes and notifications. Okay, here's another example which we've already encountered in the field. Learner has a credential, but now the Registrar, the issuer has tweaked the schema of the credential or the tweaked the description of the schema of the credential. Right. And this could be very minor adjustments, like the VC has a description field that describes, for example, the diploma. This is a computer science degree from University of San Diego. This is what it means. And the Registrar caught a spelling mistake and fixed it. Does that mean a credential should be reissued?

[00:13:30.510] 
Right.

[00:13:30.680] - Speaker 1
So this is a trivial example. Likely not. How about if it is a major adjustment, the list of required courses or the criteria has changed. Here again, just due to the nature of our credentials. If it's an actual diploma, it remains stable in time. You graduated in 2002 regardless of how the program or the degree requirements have changed in the future. That doesn't make your either credential scheme or whatever Invalid, even though newer issued ones are different. Although again we have to be careful because I graduated in 2002. For example, I have a Verifiable credential attesting to it, I lose the wallet. And now I'm going to the issue and say, hey, give me another please issue me a new copy of my diploma credentials. And so we need to talk about how should the wallet or the requester be able to somehow specify the version of the VC that they want, or if it's strictly an issue or responsibility to keep track of the versions of their schema, depending on when the person graduated, et cetera. So now we're getting into the notion of verifying credentials and versioning schemas both in minor and major ways, which is where the software development notion of semantic versioning comes in.

[00:15:28.280] - Speaker 1
That's where. And you find this a lot of times with application version numbers or software library version numbers, where the first number is the major version for breaking changes or rewrites. And the second number, the minor, is for minor tweaks that are still backwards compatible and so on.

[00:15:54.190] 
Right.

[00:15:54.380] - Speaker 1
So we need to talk about Verifiable credential versioning. And then a bonus scenario is on a future call. We'll talk about composite VCs, whether it's a VC and that recommendations and endorsements for that VC that are linked to or, for example, in several student ID data models. Their model is a composite credential where you have the top level container. This is a student ID credential that hash links to a standalone photo credential, a standalone age verification credential, and a standalone membership to the University credential. Right. And so the relevance to today's topic is, say a new student ID is being received by the wallet and the issue policy is obsolete the previous ones. What should the wallet do? Not only about the previous container VC, but also about the anchored VCs. Do they obsolete those? Well, do they need to obsolete the photo credential? You get the idea. Okay, so these are some of the topics we've come up against. These are the questions we need to ask as a community. So I'd love to hear from the group thoughts, experiences in the field. What are your conceptual model of a Credential and of multiple copies of a Credential and so on.

[00:17:56.790] - Speaker 1
Let's open the discussion to the floor.

[00:18:01.710] - Speaker 2
This is Carrie. We have a little bit of a queue going. I didn't want to stretch you. One thing I do want to tell you, if you didn't notice, is the transcriber quit because the recording stopped. I started the recording again, but the transcriber didn't start again.

[00:18:18.160] - Speaker 1
Got it. Okay.

[00:18:19.500] - Speaker 2
If anybody is able to transcribe while we're talking the call, that would be really helpful. Otherwise, you will figure that out. Sure. Okay. So I'm really glad you brought all of these up. I feel as though almost all of these could be their own topics with multiple calls because other than the extremely identical, identical example they started with, we are opening up with rabbit holes.

[00:18:46.120] - Speaker 1
That's right. So wait, before we continue with the questions, do we have a kind volunteer to transcribe. If you haven't done it before, it's easy. You don't need to capture word for word, just the general gist of what was said. Do we have a volunteer? All right. Should you change your mind? Please speak up in the queue.

[00:19:17.770] - Speaker 2
He'll do it after he asks his question.

[00:19:19.820] - Speaker 1
Okay, fantastic. Thank you, Phil. All right.

[00:19:24.250] - Speaker 2
Okay. So just some early thoughts. Initial thoughts. Anyway, one is that we have an existing standard Open badges that does have an issue on field and what that means. Now keep in mind that we are looking to navigate a line and Open badges would be natively. So the issue on the field with Open badges would be replaced by this issuance field, which I was surprised to see the two point OVC changes.

[00:19:57.490] - Speaker 1
Oh, yeah. Something to keep in mind as far as Open badges data model, you may want to start out with both fields, the issuance date for backwards compatibility with 10, but also forward looking and slightly less confusing. Valid from, right?

[00:20:19.750] - Speaker 2
Yeah, that's good. I would like to cover a little bit later what's valid from and the differences between the two maybe and 2.0. But before we get there, one thought is an Open badge issued on property. It's a little bit vague, but it's always sort of taken. It says the definition of the timestamp of when the achievement was awarded. That is kind of using issue in the world. But I think historically it could be awarded is the day that the recognition happened. Right. And for a single achievement, I think that is important in many use cases. When you get to the Clr and you have these transcripts, I think it may be different. And I think that when we dig into all of these, we'll have to consider all of this because in one case, for instance, I have a driver's license, right. I changed my address. I still have a driver's license. They gave me a duplicate. It says duplicate on it, but it's still my valid driver's license. So there's a way to sort of message, hey, this is the duplicate. And many places who are looking to sell alcohol, they check IDs and they won't accept duplicates or at least they used to not.

[00:21:41.830] - Speaker 2
I don't know if that's changed as the technology licenses have changed. So that's one thought. We had talked about how at some point in early conversation about the date, the proof date, and how that might be a way to approach it. So I guess what I'm getting at is that maybe there's different recommendations for different types of approaches and maybe there's something more general such as messaging that says, hey, this is a duplicate just so that, you know, the Verifier knows the difference in terms of identity. That is going to be interesting to discuss too. Because in Open badges you can issue a badge to an email address and then we're looking at how you get a dead associated with that credential, you could have both in there. So what happens if the email address changes and what happens if the did changes in the example that you brought up? We have to consider that also. We should probably bring in guardianship and delegation to this, because that is another consideration in all of this. Right.

[00:22:48.810] - Speaker 1
Great point.

[00:22:51.090] - Speaker 2
Yes. Those are the thoughts I had right now so far.

[00:22:54.300] - Speaker 1
Thanks, Carrie.

[00:22:55.330] - Speaker 2
Oh, wait, one other thing. Sorry, I just remembered is that also an Open badge is currently for the semantic differences. There is a versioning in Open badges, and that's sort of been a discussion about how that feels could be used. So I think that's related to all of us, too.

[00:23:11.490] - Speaker 1
Fantastic. Thanks, Phil. I think you're up next. And if you're talking, you're muted.

[00:23:34.130] - Speaker 2
Don't get audio turned on for sure.

[00:23:39.990] - Speaker 1
So we're not showing audio on for you. If you want to try reconnecting or something will come back to Barker. Yeah.

[00:24:05.760] - Speaker 3
You still get a fill. That's okay.

[00:24:07.490] - Speaker 1
Excellent.

[00:24:09.790] - Speaker 3
Yeah. When you were talking about the different types of credentials, Singleton versus replacement, I just wanted to ask about where do things like licenses that have to be renewed. Fitting, it might be a license to practice a license to teach something like that which has to be renewed each year. So it's not replacing the previous one. It's not invalidating the previous license. It's important to know that the person was licensed in the past, but also important to know that the license has been reissued and so continues for another year.

[00:24:47.230] - Speaker 1
That's a great question. Already in the ecosystem, we have some of the tools to express what you've described, meaning we have revocation section of the credentials, we have revocation lists, we have the expired field. What you're describing is even richer because the license is still valid when it was presented previously. This is just a renewal of it, payment of dues, whatever, re, accreditation. How do we denote that?

[00:25:22.570] - Speaker 3
Yeah, exactly. Possibly the only thing that will change is the issuance date and the valid and date.

[00:25:33.650] - Speaker 1
Right. Thank you. Yeah. I'll have to add that to our recommendations that use Case P one. So long. Let's try audio if you'd be muted explicitly, if you want to try muting still showing you as needed. All right. So we'll give T one another chance to come back. Anybody else other questions, either for clarification or to share policy.

[00:26:37.150] - Speaker 2
I'm ready to thank you.

[00:26:38.970] - Speaker 1
Go ahead. Marty, can you hear me? Yes. Great.

[00:26:44.230] - Speaker 4
So just to add on to Phil Barker's statement about licenses, there's also the opportunity for additional endorsements or features to be added to an existing license. So when you're stating that more kind of complex license that may have one or many endorsements, there could be a need where the versioning or replacement adds additional assertions within a single credential.

[00:27:18.850] - Speaker 1
Oh, great point. Yeah. So this is not even a renewal. Replacement or refreshment it's more information that is being added. How do we denote that? Right. That's great.

[00:27:33.230] - Speaker 5
I'm here.

[00:27:33.930] - Speaker 1
I think we can hear you. Go ahead.

[00:27:38.090] - Speaker 5
Sorry about that. I was having real troubles with my Bluetooth connection, so I missed some of the last conversation. But getting back to the beginning, it seems perfectly reasonable that there's a difference administratively in the date the institution believes it is issued a Credential, and the date with a verifiable Credential version of it is issued to the holder because of the various administrative processes that may need to take place within the institution. So I think we have to accommodate that difference somewhere in the data model, because it just doesn't seem likely that we can always assume that a verifiable Credential issuance is exactly the date that the institutions processes internally have made the Credential valid. Did that make sense?

[00:28:33.440] 
Absolutely. Yeah.

[00:28:34.790] - Speaker 5
Okay. Secondly, I'm not entirely clear on the downsides of multiple identical credentials, because if the verification takes place and the institution whether it's version verified Credential one which is identical to verify the Credential too. If either one of those are presented for verification. As long as the institution views that the identity is valid, it doesn't seem to me that there is an issue of having multiple of them. And Secondly, I can see where you might want to have a backup strategy which separates copies in multiple locations, so to avoid for greater security. So I'm not entirely clear on the downsides of the identical Credential. Maybe someone can clarify that more themselves. Thirdly, I assume that the wallets are keeping a presentation send log in their records so that you have a date associated with the presentation that is sent to a third party. It does strike me as being reasonable if there is a way that can be captured. Even I'm not sure how you would do this, but a way to keep that so that you can go back and track the usage from a wallet of credentials and the times and places they're presented.

[00:30:11.200] - Speaker 5
That seems to me an important audit trail, but I don't know if that's common in all wallets. Last comment, you made reference to key rotation, and depending on frequency, I don't see any problem with key rotation resulting in mass reissuance, to be honest, because I would think you would want to have the keys that are being used to sign as part of the verification process in some fashion. Now, if you have multiple keys, as you gave an example and both of them are used in the context of signing, then I could see whether you could have a multi SIG Credential where only one of them is currently being used, and then you change which one is being used from the presentation perspective when a rotation takes place. So I could see potentially where a rotation signals to the issuer excuse me, signals to the holder's wallet. The Credential which is primary for the purposes, again, of keeping the audit trail. But as long as both of them are there or multiple credentials signatures are there and they're valid, that seems okay to me. And I think the last question I heard a little bit of from Marty had to do with what happens when the Credential is updated and there's additional information provided.

[00:31:49.150] - Speaker 5
I get that, and I don't know if there's a way around to reissue at that point. At least, I'm not clear that they could be. So those are some of the observations that I've had in those circumstances. I do like the notion potentially of the signification of a duplicate that Kerry mentioned if a reissue takes place, and that might be something where that is simply an ongoing thing. It's not necessarily a duplicate. It's a reissue with a number, because I can see those things happening over time. And you like to keep track of where they are. Thank you.

[00:32:28.930] - Speaker 1
Thanks, Phillip. Really good. So I added myself to the queue to touch on one aspect of what you asked, which is the what's the downside of having multiple identical copies from a storage perspective? Nothing you have just like the rights to backup I can copy and store one of my files in multiple locations. No real downside there. The downside that we've encountered on the Wallet is from a user interface is if you have multiple copies of the same Credential stored in the Wallet, and if the user sees two identical Verifiable Credential cards in their inventory gets confusing. So that was our primary reason why we don't have multiple copies in the same wallet.

[00:33:38.770] - Speaker 5
Comment on that. Yeah, I could see that the wallet may have an option in the configuration of it for display purposes to only present one copy of an identical Credential for the ease of user interaction with it, and perhaps even a notation by it that saying this is one copy of three or whatever the number are that happens to be there. So I see that as a relatively as a presentation question from the perspective of the user experience in the Wallet and not necessarily a problem with the use of duplicate identical credentials across the ecosystem.

[00:34:30.170] - Speaker 1
Go ahead, Uly. You're up next.

[00:34:33.290] - Speaker 6
Thanks. I wanted to share my thoughts on the downsides of multiple credentials because I believe the discussion in the wallet is more of a symptom discussion than addressing the problem. I think multiple issued credentials for a single real Credential. So to say that if I'm doing my Master's and I'm receiving a Credential and I'm receiving multiple for it is something that promotes bad or lazy behavior, because there is a reason why shouldn't that, often because I have some button in my student information system that I can click, and therefore these credentials are issued again and again and again. I believe we should recommend the issuer to keep track of the credentials that they have issued because in case of revocation. They were not sure how often this Credential was in fact issued. For example, maybe the first guts get revolved, but the suction one, maybe they don't get revolved and not recommending that they only issue once we reach the lady behavior that they won't keep track of their issued credentials and thus preventing them from revoking if they need to.

Thank Sully. Great points. David, you're up next.

[00:36:10.450] - Speaker 6
Yeah, can you hear me?

[00:36:11.820] - Speaker 1
Yes, go ahead.

[00:36:13.510] - Speaker 6
Yeah. I guess one of the things that I'm wondering about along the licensing and things like that is the difference in the way that the credentials are looked at for renewing versus reissuing versus issuing a new one and how revocation will work against Silicon. Are they actually considered the same or are they different Identifiers that are considered differentials?

[00:36:41.150] - Speaker 1
Yeah, those great questions. That's exactly the kind of thing we need to decide as a community or create affordances for the issuers to state anybody else. Any other questions? Comments. All right, so we've got a couple of minutes left. Let's talk about next steps. We've had some really good discussion so far, and so what next? Right. How do we capture these topics? So we definitely want to add some of these situations to our Use Cases document. We want to talk about license renewals and explicit duplicate mechanisms like driver's licenses. We want to mention inboxes and notifications. We want to mention the use case where new information is being added to an existing Credential. So Open badges issued on field. I suspect we'll be discussing open badges in future calls as well. Anything else you want to capture from this conversation? Go ahead.

[00:38:13.920] - Speaker 5
One other thing, which is I don't have a real good sense of the actual degree to which credentials once issued by the institutions are edited. The comment was raised earlier about what about correcting if there's a minor scheme of change typo or something like that. The Credential itself is not substantively changed. And I hear often from registrars, and this is not a criticism of registrars, but I hear often from registrars that the frequency with which changes are made to issue credentials is higher than we think. And I'm just wondering whether that's an unconscious bias in reaction to the effort it takes to deal with those changes rather than the true level of frequency. So I think we should collect some data from registrars about this question. How frequently have our existing credentials issued changed and then the various categories or reasons for change that would be useful for us to figure out the right things we should be addressing. Thank you.

[00:39:31.490] - Speaker 1
Great points, Phil. So one thing I think we can start doing is Carrie has opened a number of issues based on Use case items in the VCD GitHub repo. So one thing we can do is extract some of the top picking questions from this presentation as individual issues and then make poll request proposals. As usual, any other questions or comments before we adjourn.

[00:40:17.850] - Speaker 5
Demetria, in your experience so far with the DCC pilot, what is the primary or most frequent circumstance of reissuance that you're encountering?

[00:40:41.090] - Speaker 1
The current DCC pilot is very focused, very limited. We don't have, for example, a notification mechanism so that if the issuer needs to reissue that's handled out of band, students get a new email saying, hey, we've reissued, go download this new one so we don't have that data. The thing that has inspired these questions and this discussion was just because the process of adding a credential to the wallet is so low friction, it's very easy for it to happen accidentally. So what do we do from that for the request to request two different copies of the credential, either static or through a VC API issue call. All right. Any other questions?

[00:41:45.730] - Speaker 2
To be too curious, put myself in the queue, please.

[00:41:48.890] - Speaker 1
Go ahead.

[00:41:50.410] - Speaker 2
One thing is we do have a topic for refreshing credentials. I think it ties into that. And if we have a couple of minutes before we go, I just wanted to sort of review where we are with the Use cases and the issues. If we're done with your topic for now.

[00:42:07.210] - Speaker 1
Yes, go ahead.

[00:42:09.350] - Speaker 2
Okay, real quick, because it all ties together. This is the link to Use Cases Doc. Not much has changed since the last time you saw it, although some folks have come in and made comments, and I really appreciate that. So please keep us coming. John Cole, you made a really good recommendation to add platforms, as usual, and I really want to do that because I think that's going to help clarify quite a bit. So I'm going to work on that some more. And then also I'm sorry, Dimitri mentioned that these issues were created. So this is a link to the issues in VCs that have been created so far. They mostly come actually from the topic spreadsheet. You'll notice that some say use cases on them, and that's because they haven't been entered into Use Cases Doc yet. So I'm going to work on that. In addition to doing what Denisey, you suggested, which is to get these Use cases into the dock and then also into the issues so that we have some reference there and we can start working on them. The Use Cases Doc is a reference right for us and for the broader Uses community.

[00:43:14.900] - Speaker 2
But the issues are a way for us to tackle the model Doc and to really start digging into these individually. So please take a look at these issues that have been created and dig into the ones that you are very interested in. Just make notes and comments or any references or information that you might have some of your perspective that will be helpful. And then we can pick this up in the following weeks. That's all I have for now. Thank you.

[00:43:40.010] - Speaker 1
Thanks, Gary. All right, everybody, review the documents. Add Commons. Thank you so much. We are at the top of the hour. Talk to you all next week. Yes. Thanks.
