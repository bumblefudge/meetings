<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There&apos;s some other cryptographic mechanism that they could use that&apos;s not a did and or things like is this document about a child and it&apos;s their Guardian that&apos;s with them and it&apos;s the guardian that you want to increase confidence in that standing there in front of you so it has a bunch of positive uses when it comes to Guardianship and just building confidence that an individual standing in front of you is who the verifiable credential you. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Long</span>:  Well one of the things I&apos;ve learned in 36 sessions of Internet identity Workshop is that the best way to send an identity discussion off the rails is to start defining identity as everybody seems to have a different definition but of course if you&apos;re going to write a book about identity you have to basically have to start with some kind of definition. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Long</span>:   Nishan and actually my favorite definition. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Long</span>:  Identity is one I learned from Joe Andrew years ago and in Joe Joe to find digital identity as the way we recognize remember respond to people places things organizations basically any other thing in the in the world in a digital world if we&apos;re talking about digital identity and the reason I like that definition is because. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Long</span>:   Cuz it&apos;s very functional. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Long</span>:  It informs a lot of the ways that we want to a lot of the things we want when we build an identity system we want to be able to recognize who&apos;s on the other end and that basically that&apos;s authentication when he bailed remember them right which means we&apos;ve got some sort of identity store and then we need to be able to respond to them or interact with them is maybe better but it doesn&apos;t have the alliteration of the 3 R&apos;s and that means that it&apos;s got to have some kind of utility it&apos;s got allow us to do things. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="information">Harrison_Tang: So what are the kind of use cases earlier you mentioned identity should be a the able to account allows us to do things what are those things. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Phil Long</span>:  I mean it&apos;s what I want to say is everything right because you know digital identity is at the foundation of almost everything we want to do online and the reason for that is because the digital world is very different from the physical world if you think about that definition recognize remember and respond and then think about the physical world we naturally do all of those things recognized. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>
