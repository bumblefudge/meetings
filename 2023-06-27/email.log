Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Hi everyone so welcome to this week's w3c ccg 
  credentials communities group meeting so this week we have a 
  little special session we invited filled with only one of the SSI 
  Pioneers to discuss his new book learning digital identity this 
  session is Taylor for the general audience usually talk about a 
  little bit more technical stuff so so this session is a little 
  bit different and.
Harrison_Tang:  actually had the opportunity to provide.
Harrison_Tang: From people to learn more about sobriety and 
  decentralized identity space so so that's that's our fun but 
  before we get to the main agenda I just want to go over some 
  admin stuff first of all just want to remind everyone about the 
  code of ethics and professional conduct reminder more or less 
  just one make sure that we make respectful comments and 
  acknowledge each other's opinions.
Harrison_Tang:  a quick I keynote anyone can participate.
Harrison_Tang: Overall substantive contributions to the ccg work 
  items must be members of the CCT with for IP our agreement sign 
  know make sure you have the w3c account and you encounter any 
  issues just let any of the co-chairs now.
Harrison_Tang: And minutes are being recorded we will we have the 
  ultimate risk Riker and the minutes are automatically published 
  in a day or two we use GT chat to skew speakers during the call 
  and you can type in Cube plus to add yourself to the queue or q- 
  to remove it.
Harrison_Tang: All right let's get to that introductions and 
  reintroductions if anyone is new to the community or want to 
  re-engage the with the community please feel free to unmute and 
  introduce yourself.
Harrison_Tang: We have a lot of new folks today so you know 
  hopefully you have the chance to if you like the content today 
  and also are interested in the decentralized alcibiades space 
  hopefully you can rejoin us on Tuesday 9:00 a.m. Pacific time and 
  12 p.m. eastern time.
Harrison_Tang: All right let's get to the announcements and 
  reminders any announcement and reminders that people want to 
  share.
<manu_sporny> Selective Disclosure for Data Integrity:
Manu Sporny: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2023May/0104.html
Manu Sporny:  Yeah I just a quick note about an email that went 
  out to the credentials community group earlier today it's about 
  the selective disclosure for w3c data Integrity so a month or so 
  ago we talked about selective disclosure for data Integrity so 
  there was a post that went out around this new selective 
  disclosure may occur.
Manu Sporny:   ISM for data integrity.
Manu Sporny:  Three along with a slide deck so that first link 
  has a slide deck to what we're talking about fundamentally what 
  this technology allows someone to do is they allow the individual 
  using a data Integrity cryptography sweet to only show some parts 
  of a document that they have so like if you have for example a 
  driver's license it would allow you to only show your ZIP code.
Manu Sporny:   Code or only.
Manu Sporny:  Share your last name or something like that so the 
  there are two current there's there's a mechanism called BBS 
  which is a selective disclosure mechanism that does unlikable 
  signatures that the be cwg has in scope but one of the concerns 
  there is that it is not a nist compliant selective disclosure 
  scheme meaning that you know Federal governments.
Manu Sporny:   It's state governments National.
Manu Sporny:  Large organizations like to see nist support So 
  this thing The Selective disclosure mechanism called ecdsa SD has 
  been put forward as a full solution with you know a slide deck 
  talking about it there's some upcoming pull requests to the 
  verify credentials working group specifications that might 
  included but before we do that we want to make sure that.
Manu Sporny:  Addict support people anything yet people.
<manu_sporny> Request for support for Selective Disclosure: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2023Jun/0164.html
Manu Sporny:  Looking at implementing it and things of that 
  nature So to that end a request went out to the ccg to gather 
  signatures from people that are interested in seeing a nist 
  approved selective disclosure mechanism for verifiable 
  credentials so that email can be found here request for support 
  for closure.
Manu Sporny:  Point I'll make on this is this is not a 
  replacement for BBS it is not a replacement for some of the 
  supply chain you know Merkel proof mechanisms that were talking 
  about this is just one of potentially many selective disclosure 
  mechanisms the benefit of this one is that it uses cryptography 
  that is approved by NASA to the standards and the US and 
  therefore.
Manu Sporny:   And Canadian.
Manu Sporny:  If you're interested in supporting this please take 
  a look at that email sign the letter of support and if you have 
  further questions I'm happy to answer those on the mailing list 
  that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Mom you thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Any other announcements and reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Any other updates on the ccg work items.
Manu Sporny:  Is Oliver here he might have dropped.
Manu Sporny:  I don't see him so Oliver term who put out a new 
  work item in the ccg or just a request for support for new work 
  item called confidence method and so what confidence method does 
  is it's an extension to a verifiable credential into the 
  verifiable credentials data model that allows an issuer to say 
  you know these claims.
Manu Sporny:   That I'm making about.
Manu Sporny:  X if you want to increase your confidence that that 
  subject is the one standing in front of you here are some ways to 
  do that and so one of the traditional ways going to quote 
  traditional ways we've done it in this group is we've said oh 
  they can do did authentication but as the VC ecosystem it's grown 
  in the use cases have become broader there are other mechanisms 
  that people are interested in using like do they have a physical 
  identity document with them that you could check.
Manu Sporny:  There's some other cryptographic mechanism that 
  they could use that's not a did and or things like is this 
  document about a child and it's their Guardian that's with them 
  and it's the guardian that you want to increase confidence in 
  that standing there in front of you so it has a bunch of positive 
  uses when it comes to Guardianship and just building confidence 
  that an individual standing in front of you is who the verifiable 
  credential you.
Manu Sporny:   No describes it was issued to so take a look at 
  that if folks are interested that.
Manu Sporny:  Went out to the mailing list earlier today I'll get 
  a link to it in drop it in the chat here in a bit that's it.
Harrison_Tang: All right thank you menu.
Harrison_Tang: Any other announcements or updates to work items.
<manu_sporny> Confidence Method announcement: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2023Jun/0170.html
Harrison_Tang: All right so.
Harrison_Tang: I too am an agenda So today we're very very happy 
  to actually invite built when lie to kind of talk about his new 
  book as well as the SSI and decentralized Authority in general 
  Phil was the founder and the organizer of the internet identity 
  Workshop which is one of the biggest identity related conferences 
  the founder and the chair of sovereign and Adjunct professor at 
  Brigham Young University so his new book learning digital 
  identity is a guide to the design team.
Harrison_Tang:  appointment and the management digital identity 
  architecture.
Harrison_Tang: The prime managers architect and developer so 
  welcome Phil.
Phil Long:  Thanks Harrison it's great to be here with you guys.
Harrison_Tang: Great great so so I think today we all do a little 
  bit of a different format generally we have to do a prize big 
  presentation and then also the general Q&A but today we just have 
  going to have a light conversation I'll be asking feel some 
  questions and I think Buddy have any questions regard to any 
  anything in regards to set the centralized identity ourselves 
  over identity feel free to just add a coupon.
Harrison_Tang: Up to the queue and then I'll be moderating the 
  questions right so Phil since we're talking about a kind of a 
  decentralized Authority salsa bribe Andy do you mind actually 
  help us Define what digital identity is and also what is self 
  Sovereign identity as well as what is this decentralized identity 
  what are the definitions because I hear these terms thrown around 
  and a lot of times they are used interchangeably so do you mind.
Harrison_Tang:  actually clarify these definitions for us.
Phil Long:  Well one of the things I've learned in 36 sessions of 
  Internet identity Workshop is that the best way to send an 
  identity discussion off the rails is to start defining identity 
  as everybody seems to have a different definition but of course 
  if you're going to write a book about identity you have to 
  basically have to start with some kind of definition.
Phil Long:   Nishan and actually my favorite definition.
Phil Long:  Identity is one I learned from Joe Andrew years ago 
  and in Joe Joe to find digital identity as the way we recognize 
  remember respond to people places things organizations basically 
  any other thing in the in the world in a digital world if we're 
  talking about digital identity and the reason I like that 
  definition is because.
Phil Long:   Cuz it's very functional.
Phil Long:  It informs a lot of the ways that we want to a lot of 
  the things we want when we build an identity system we want to be 
  able to recognize who's on the other end and that basically 
  that's authentication when he bailed remember them right which 
  means we've got some sort of identity store and then we need to 
  be able to respond to them or interact with them is maybe better 
  but it doesn't have the alliteration of the 3 R's and that means 
  that it's got to have some kind of utility it's got allow us to 
  do things.
Harrison_Tang: So what are the kind of use cases earlier you 
  mentioned identity should be a the able to account allows us to 
  do things what are those things.
Phil Long:  I mean it's what I want to say is everything right 
  because you know digital identity is at the foundation of almost 
  everything we want to do online and the reason for that is 
  because the digital world is very different from the physical 
  world if you think about that definition recognize remember and 
  respond and then think about the physical world we naturally do 
  all of those things recognized.
Phil Long:   Objects and people and places.
Phil Long:  We remember them we have a physical means of 
  interacting we don't have to think about that it's all just built 
  into what we are as physical beings in the digital world we don't 
  have any of that right we have a proximity problem we're not 
  close to the other thing that we're interacting with the other 
  person and so we have to build digital identity systems in order 
  to allow us to do almost anything online so when I talk about 
  relationship.
Phil Long:  You know to the everything but really when you boil 
  it down it's about those things how do we recognize and remember 
  people right and how do we how do we authenticate them and how do 
  we store what we know about them so that we can remember them the 
  next time and then how do we interact with them and generally 
  that was going to come down to things like authorization 
  messaging the basic kinds of things we do digitally that our base 
  and base those on a digital identity so that we're doing them on 
  the.
Phil Long:   Son of a.
Phil Long:  That relationship idea is really one of the core 
  ideas in the book I like to say that we build identity systems 
  not to manage identities but rather to manage relationships and 
  so if you think about every digital identity that you have 
  created somewhere it's about some particular kind of relationship 
  and that relationship and it's.
Phil Long:  Out of that relationship with the other party wants 
  out of the relationship really defines the kind of utility that 
  you might get so when I create an account at Amazon of course I'm 
  looking to shop and so the kinds of things I can do with that 
  relationship that utility of that relationship or defined based 
  on the fact that I want to shop there on the other hand when I 
  you know exchange email addresses with you Harrison and we send 
  email back and forth there's a identity their the email.
Phil Long:   Dress and wear.
Phil Long:  Gene to accomplish something but that is much more 
  open right gives you that kind of relationship is much richer 
  than the transaction relationships we often have with with 
  website so I like to categorize relationships has transaction or 
  interactional and the interaction relationships are actually the 
  ones that have been largely shortchanged by traditional identity 
  systems.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you so do you might actually kind of 
  summarize a little bit about what your new book learning tissue 
  identities about actually bought the book and then read the first 
  two chapters I haven't finished the whole thing but even by 
  actually kind of share sure and summarize your books are like the 
  top three or five concepts for us.
Phil Long:  Yeah well I mean the the one I just talked about 
  relationships is probably one of the Core Concepts I use the idea 
  of relationships as the reason we build identity systems to talk 
  through a lot of the things a lot of the traditional things we 
  think about identity systems like authentication and 
  authorization another core idea in the book is that identity 
  systems really.
Phil Long:   The thing we care more.
Phil Long:  Obviously if you're an engineer at a specific company 
  building an identity system to manage a specific kind of 
  relationship you care a lot about that identity system that has 
  identity professionals I think we are more often thinking in 
  terms of identity meta systems right Kim Cameron and introduced 
  this idea of identity meta systems back in 2004 I think and and 
  the idea there is what are the overall Technologies and 
  interaction patterns.
Phil Long:   That occur within a specific set of.
Phil Long:  An identity system so you know in the early days most 
  identity systems were centralized and were largely just 
  administrative and we didn't really think about them in terms of 
  medicine systems as Web 2.0 caught on in the early 2000s most 
  identity systems and their predominant meta system of that era 
  was what we would categorize as an administrative identity system 
  yeah I mentioned Amazon.
Phil Long:   Earlier Amazons.
Phil Long:  Storm is Administrative it's built to administer a 
  particular kind of relationship by a particular company for their 
  purposes right I don't mean that in some pejorative way or some 
  you know evil way it's just that's why we build identity systems 
  I did the same thing when I had an e-commerce company as we got 
  you know that can 2005 ish people started thinking about well how 
  are we going to manage or interact with all of.
Phil Long:   All of these.
Phil Long:  Who are coming to our websites because before that 
  identity was largely like I said administrative and centralized 
  and that's when we started to see things like open ID pop up and 
  then later all wath and open ID connect and you know what I call 
  the Social login medicine system and in that you know we kind of 
  had these Visions back in 2005 2006 that everybody would use 
  their domain name as their.
Phil Long:   A fire it turned out you know you know what people.
Phil Long:  Problem and you know issues of trust that wasn't 
  realistic and so it turned out that there's only a handful of 
  large what we call identity providers or idps who are who are 
  building identity systems that other companies use right I'm not 
  talking about like yeah they sell them the softer I'm talking 
  about like you know login with Facebook or Google's log in 
  systems that other other.
Phil Long:   Thersites use based on OS and now open ID.
Phil Long:  So I call that meta system to social login medicine 
  system and then recently you know since 2016 or so a new medicine 
  system has been in development that we generally refer to as the 
  self Sovereign Identity or SSI meta system which is has a 
  different set of principles of different set of Technologies and 
  a different set of goals and so that's you know one another one 
  of the core ideas and then I.
Phil Long:   I think you know to round that out is.
Phil Long:  Kim Cameron's laws of identity early in the book in 
  chapter 4 and then I use those you know throughout the book on 
  occasion to talk about why certain things are certain 
  architectures serve certain needs or don't meet certain needs and 
  kind of finish up the book talking about how the social login 
  medicine system which is what I would say is the current 
  predominant identity medicine system and the SSI medicine.
Phil Long:   Which is.
Phil Long:  We call the emerging medicine system how they compare 
  when stacked up against the Kim Cameron's laws.
Harrison_Tang: So since we have a lot of kind of kind of the new 
  members and new audiences joining today so do you mind actually 
  clarify what are those laws of identity.
Phil Long:  Yeah so back in 2004 Kim Cameron wrote a paper called 
  the laws of identity and if you Google that you'll find lots of 
  references to it and his and his original paper what he describes 
  both the idea of an identity medicine system and these laws and 
  there are seven laws the first one is user control and consent so 
  you can.
Phil Long:   Judge identity.
Phil Long:  Stumps or see how see how they stack up against each 
  other by thinking about how do they manage user control and 
  consent do they allow for it what to what degree do they allow 
  for it the second one is minimal disclosure for a constrained use 
  so you're only giving as much information as you actually need 
  and the use is constrained in some way based on the relationship 
  justifiable parties who has access to the data are they 
  justifiable.
Phil Long:   Oil can you tell why they're part of the.
Phil Long:  Access to the data directed identity which is a which 
  is an interesting one so the Kim called it directed identity now 
  I think we would call it peer to peer Identity or the ability to 
  have non-universal identifiers pluralism of operators and 
  Technologies by which Kim meant is there a underlying protocol to 
  The Meta system which then.
Phil Long:   Allows multiple players.
Phil Long:  Systems which match the protocol and and interact in 
  the identity system human integration to what extent is the human 
  involved in the identity system and then finally consistent 
  experience across context which I think is one of the interesting 
  ones because you know there are certain things about identity 
  systems which are consistent some of those we don't like so much 
  like passwords but in fact you know if you go log.
Phil Long:   Into website and login to website B even though.
Phil Long:  Also using usernames and passwords the user 
  experience can be wildly different where did they put the box 
  where do I have to put in my email address so I have to pick a 
  username and me so that's the final law.
Harrison_Tang: Got it and how how does like early talk about 
  different kinds of identity architectures like how how is the new 
  kind of SSI or stuff like that ccg has been kind of working on 
  verifiable credentials those kind of technology different from 
  today's social login kind of kind of the Federated model.
Phil Long:  Yeah so so it's interesting.
Phil Long:  You know the I think most people in the car would be 
  familiar with you know the social login medicine we have the 
  identity provider is using open-eyed nap dummy could be using 
  something else let's just use that for now as you said Federated 
  and the identity provider is essentially managing the user 
  manages their identity through the identity provider and then 
  chooses to use it at a different.
Phil Long:  And you know I kind of thought when I first decided I 
  was going to think about this in terms of Kim's laws that I'd 
  find you know several places where all there were you know real 
  big problems it turns out social login medicine system actually 
  Stacks up pretty well in in Kim's laws the biggest problems turn 
  out to be ended.
Phil Long:   Directed identity.
Phil Long:  Right social login largely uses what Kim called an 
  omnidirectional but we would probably call a public identifier 
  almost exclusively and so it doesn't have that directed 
  identifiers that peer-to-peer identify it as a result has some 
  have some problems with privacy you know as we've seen you know 
  and then then you get into you know what degree do they have mean 
  is the user experience.
Phil Long:   It's consistent yeah I mean to a large degree it is 
  although.
Phil Long:  Obviously there's lots of choice for people how they 
  how they Implement things and so you can get some difference 
  there user can crawl control and consent in fact the whole idea 
  of open ID back in the early days was user-centric right it begin 
  the fact that the user logs into their identity provider and 
  authorizes the use of that identity at a relying party is all 
  about user control and consent so so you really get into.
Phil Long:   What degree does does the user have.
Phil Long:  But like I said I think the directed Identity or peer 
  identity is the place where the social login medicine system 
  probably doesn't do as well as we would as we hope it does you 
  know the the SSI meta system as I looked at it Stacks up very 
  well with Kim's laws in fact you know I think you know Kim didn't 
  particularly like didn't particularly like the word self 
  Sovereign but I.
Phil Long:   Think that.
Phil Long:  Principles that self Sovereign identity systems 
  embodied were largely in keeping with with the SSI meta system 
  and in fact you know his original info cards implementation or or 
  design architectures better word than implementation feels very 
  similar in many ways to how SSI works now the technology was 
  different because the technology has moved.
Phil Long:   Don since.
Phil Long:  2000'S but but info cards were you know very 
  different from open ID for example and at internet identity 
  Workshop in the early days those two systems came and and you 
  know they were both present and being worked on by different 
  people so I think SSI matches up fairly well now like I said 
  earlier you can always judge these things on degree so will 
  somebody come up.
Phil Long:   With new ideas that you know.
Phil Long:  We call it something else besides SSI I don't know 
  but well and come up with new ideas that you know meet those laws 
  even better perhaps but right now I think that the SSI meta 
  system is the architecture that embodies Kim's laws the best and 
  gives us the benefit of what Kim was looking for when he wrote 
  down those laws.
Harrison_Tang: Does it end so why doesn't Kim like the word SSI 
  self Sovereign like other other alternatives.
Phil Long:  Well I mean you know it's unfortunately Kim is no 
  longer with it right he passed 18-24 months ago and so you know I 
  don't like to put words in his in his in his mouth I had several 
  discussions with him about it I think.
Phil Long:  I think that you know the the idea of self 
  sovereignty especially when I was talking with him about it which 
  was you know the 2019 2020 timeframe there was a lot of pushback 
  on self Sovereign because people didn't necessarily understand 
  what Sovereign meant in this context you know a lot of 
  governments for example hated it because they said well we're 
  Sovereign but you know I think my view self sovereignty defines a 
  boundary and.
Phil Long:   And it says what things am I totally autonomous.
Phil Long:  Things am I not autonomous in and you know it's not 
  that I have control over everything it's that I have control over 
  some things and sovereignty defines what those things are and 
  this is consistent with how we use sovereignty when we talk about 
  Nations as well the fact that you know Iceland is Sovereign 
  doesn't mean that it can boss other countries around it just 
  means that it has autonomy over its territory and I think that's 
  when we talk about self sovereignty in.
Phil Long:   That says right.
Phil Long:  What we are as we are individuals who need autonomy 
  and sell and ability to self-direct how we interact in the online 
  world I don't think that Kim would have disagreed with that idea 
  I mean I think it was really just the name and you know plenty of 
  people have had issues with the name I wholeheartedly embrace the 
  terms of sovereign because I don't think any other word does the 
  the what we're trying to achieve Justice.
Phil Long:   Decentralized identity is an implementation 
  strategy.
Phil Long:  An end goal you know so I don't like that term but 
  plenty of people use it I like self Sovereign because I think it 
  describes what we're trying to achieve and while I'm on that 
  topic you know I I think that that is perhaps the most important 
  thing about self Sovereign identity what we're all working 
  towards is that.
Phil Long:  Well let me let me back up just a bit so so I start 
  to book talking about two philosophical approaches to Identity 
  which as I mentioned earlier is always dangerous right so there's 
  one approach to Identity which is what philosophers call the 
  bundle of sticks method which is your identity is nothing more 
  than all of the attributes that you happen to have or have been 
  assigned to you and and that's the bundle of six right so as you 
  gather up all of those.
Phil Long:   Attributes and bundle them together that's your 
  identity.
Phil Long:  There's a different approach right to to that to the 
  bundle of sticks and you know that that approach talks about 
  identity as springing from something right so so this is the 
  discarded his idea of I think therefore I am so just guard us was 
  a proponent.
Phil Long:   Of what's called.
Phil Long:  Meaning that all of those attributes are based on 
  something some substance and your identity really is that 
  substance so now think about the to Medicine systems that I just 
  described the cell the social login medicine system is really a 
  bundle of sticks meta system it says hey your identity is really 
  just a bunch of attributes and you're going to get some 
  attributes from this identity provider on this some attributes 
  from this other identity provider.
Phil Long:   And as long as you can you know manage your 
  attributes and get them to the right places.
Phil Long:  Solve problem self Sovereign identity is a substance 
  model right self Sovereign identity says no all of that Springs 
  from someone or something and the identity really is about the 
  thing and the attributes are just projections of properties or 
  things that have been assigned information has been assigned to 
  that thing and that's why I think self Sovereign entity is.
Phil Long:   So important because it gives people.
Phil Long:  Stand in a digital world without self Sovereign 
  identity right and from a technology standpoint something like a 
  wallet agent mechanism people really have no place to stand in a 
  digital world we are merely creatures of whatever identity 
  systems companies happen to build for us and then allow us to 
  create relationships with them on and in that world I mean you 
  know I'm not necessarily knocking it in the sense.
Phil Long:   It's been great right I like my.
Phil Long:  Wife I like shopping on Amazon and searching on 
  Google and talking to Chachi PT and you know all of those things 
  are great but I don't have a place to stand in a digital world I 
  am not fully human in a digital world and I feel like if we don't 
  build a place for people to stand in the digital world we're 
  going to as more and more of Our Lives go online we're going to 
  find ourselves increasingly at the mercy not necessarily of.
Phil Long:   Evil people or companies.
Phil Long:  Just places that companies and organizations who are 
  building identity systems for their own purposes not us right not 
  not the things that we need to do so that's I think you know 
  maybe I went too deep for you but that's that's kind of why I 
  believe that the self self and identity thing is so important.
<manu_sporny> +1000 Phil!!! Absolutely!
<tallted> seeAlso https://dbpedia.org/resource/Descartes
Phil Long:  I think that.
Harrison_Tang: Got it so what are the kind of the core technology 
  that can help us like achieve salsa red identity I is it the the 
  wallet that kind of or is it the trust triangle helping the kind 
  of the holder the data subjects like intermediate identity 
  transactions is a verifiable credentials decentralised 
  identifiers or all of the above life are the core Technologies.
Phil Long:  The wallet is barely getting you know is barely 
  coming into its own at this point and when I say wallet I really 
  mean wallet and agent and you know what so I'm just going to say 
  wallet but realize that I include the agent in that term you know 
  because I think that if you think about the World Wide Web right 
  it's a client-server architecture so there were servers that were 
  clients we all got clients browsers and the browser's gave 
  people.
Phil Long:   The ability to.
Phil Long:  Online really I mean obviously you can do other 
  things online without a browser but for most people that became 
  the way that they were online that became the way that they 
  participated in a digital world but because it's always a client 
  right it's never a place of of where things come to be and where 
  we can control things ourselves and almost everybody on this call 
  I'm sure you know run servers and has servers so to most of us it 
  was never that big of.
Phil Long:   An issue right I've got a.
Phil Long:  And I do all kinds of stuff on it but too many people 
  they don't have any of that capability they have no ability to 
  create relationships of their own accord and with their own for 
  their own utility and that's why I think the wallet is probably 
  the core and largely at this point underrated technology that is 
  going to be the key to this whole self Sovereign identity thing 
  that it's what's going to give people it's the it's a technology 
  that's going to allow people.
Phil Long:   Able to have a place to.
Phil Long:  And in the digital.
Phil Long:  World because the digital world is digital right we 
  need technology to be on it and it's not enough to just have our 
  phones because our phones are basically at this point just 
  clients we really need a wallet where we can establish our own 
  relationships and then build utility on top of those you know one 
  of the things that I you know I'm a I'm a proponent of did calm 
  and I know not everybody on this call will be but one of the 
  reasons I am is because it's protocol logical me.
Phil Long:   Being that you can Define other.
Phil Long:  So on top of did Cam which means that once I have an 
  agent that agent can be expanded in many interesting ways it can 
  well I meant in probably gonna have multiple agents I mean some 
  of the things I want to have happen can be automated it can speak 
  other protocols right it can use it to play Tic-Tac-Toe you know 
  for if any of you are familiar with Daniel hardman's tic-tac-toe 
  protocol on did Cam I can use it for almost anything inside of a 
  mutually authenticated.
Phil Long:   Cryptographically secure Communications Channel I.
Phil Long:  You know that perhaps more than yeah I don't want to 
  slight verifiable credentials I mean I tell people when I tell 
  you all of the things the verifiable credentials can do you're 
  going to just be amazed and then I'm going to tell you about did 
  Cam and you're going to be completely blown away because it's 
  even bigger than verifiable credentials so like I said I know not 
  everybody on this channel will be did components but I think 
  that's you know my that's why I would choose the wallet as the 
  corpse.
Phil Long:   Have technology because it's something that could be 
  expanded.
Phil Long:  People to you know Live digital lives live fully 
  digital lives and and do it in ways that feel natural rather than 
  feel like I'm always inside someone else's system living within 
  their bureaucratic structure you know within their rules it gives 
  me the chance to be independent and autonomous.
Harrison_Tang: Now here's a hard question do you actually think 
  that the wall is have the war of the Wallace have been warmed by 
  the platform's more particularly kind of Google and apple and if 
  so like how do we actually oh no no okay so can you clarify that 
  a little bit yeah.
Phil Long:  Back in the last decade right in the 2018 2019 time 
  period people that ask me you know what what our Google and apple 
  doing about self Sovereign identity and I would jokingly say I 
  hope they haven't even heard of it yet because I didn't want them 
  to wake up to this and kind of you know step on what was 
  happening do I think the wall towards her.
Phil Long:   Ben 10.
Phil Long:  You know like you said that's a hard question I mean 
  I really hope not I really hope that that we can not have wallets 
  that are determined right there where they're where they're where 
  their capabilities and their.
Phil Long:  Their use cases are determined by whatever a couple 
  of large companies and I'm not you know necessarily talking about 
  Apple or Google as being evil or trying to do bad things I mean 
  they're trying to do good things but of course they have their 
  own motivation which is their prophet and you know I don't 
  necessarily think they're going to give me everything that I 
  might want they're going to decide things that I would rather not 
  have I'd rather or more like email right with where I have a 
  choice of email.
Phil Long:   Clients and yeah.
Phil Long:  I get it I would really rather have you know an 
  opener ecosystem than just two large wallet vendors so I can't 
  tell you that I think they've been one I don't think they're 
  decided yet but I do think that there's danger there.
Harrison_Tang: So do you see what the kind of challenges and also 
  opportunities in the in the space.
Phil Long:  Yeah so I would probably say that the up big 
  opportunity as I just was talking about is in the wallet space 
  right now that's hard because you know nobody's going to get rich 
  on wallets in fact kind of like browsers they're probably going 
  to end up being free and so yeah that's a that just reminded me 
  of something I read this morning that the reason disinformation.
Phil Long:   Nation online is.
Phil Long:  Disinformation is a business and combating 
  disinformation as a hobby and we face that same problem right so 
  so there's a to the extent that wallets are hobbies for companies 
  because they're not profit centers I think we're in danger there 
  and so that's probably a big challenge is that how do we create 
  wallets which are useful and not you know just you know that like 
  you said one by the by the two big vendors.
Phil Long:   Ders that's a big challenge.
Phil Long:  Necessarily know that we have a good answer for it I 
  think the opportunities are in the verifiable credential space 
  you know in terms of what companies can do you know if your 
  period a company and you're trying to say okay how do I build a 
  company or how do I do something in my company that's related to 
  digital identity I think verifiable credentials are clearly the 
  big opportunity you know to the to the extent that they.
Phil Long:   They are.
Phil Long:  Containers for data that we can have cryptographic 
  confidence in their operation that's something we haven't had 
  before right that's this is a brand new thing online and I say 
  brand-new and everybody online in this meeting probably going 
  it's not brand-new I've been working on it for seven years but of 
  course in the grand scheme of things that still kind of brand new 
  you know open ID you know it wasn't till when I don't know an 
  open ID connect actually happened.
Phil Long:   Remember the exact year but it was probably at least 
  10 years after opening.
Phil Long:  Actually you know was thought about and so you know I 
  think verifiable credentials are still new most people don't know 
  about them they don't really understand how they work when I say 
  people I mean technologists I'm not talking about you know random 
  people on the street because they mostly won't care right I mean 
  they should just say oh that's his wallet it's got this thing in 
  it that feels like a driver's license or like a concert ticket 
  good I just give it to you know exchange it with this with this 
  other.
Phil Long:  Normal but to a technologist most don't don't know 
  very much about them they don't necessarily understand the 
  details even if they do so so I think that's probably the big 
  opportunity I see.
Harrison_Tang: Do you mind going a little bit deeper like why do 
  you think they are money to be made in verifiable credentials 
  like what are the kind of different market trends and 
  opportunities that you saw.
Phil Long:  So I did a back of the envelope calculation just 
  estimate kind of thing several years ago about the different 
  types of digital of verifiable credentials that are possible I'm 
  going to talk about the total number of credentials I'm talking 
  about just types right so credential definition so people on this 
  call will understand what I mean when I said credential 
  definition and is estimated that there are around 20.
Phil Long:   Million credential definitions that.
Phil Long:  Possible and that's a lot of credential definitions 
  now hopefully there's not that many schema right we can we can 
  all agree on that but I mean you can think about every small 
  business well not every but you know I think I asked mated like 
  one out of three small businesses would need some kind of 
  credential specific to their business medium sized businesses 
  large sized businesses just the different kinds of credentials.
Phil Long:   If you if you really.
Phil Long:  You know big on credentials and you start thinking 
  about exchanging value for credentials right I'm not necessarily 
  talking about you know crypto do but just some way of exchanging 
  value for for credentials now all kinds of different use cases 
  open up with you know holder pays issuer issuer pays verifier 
  verifier pays holder I mean there are all kinds of interesting 
  use cases there in fact you can see all of e-commerce as.
Phil Long:   Payment for a.
Phil Long:  In other words the receipt is the credential and I 
  essentially am paying you to get this receipt and paying for the 
  goods obviously but but exchange of a receipt credential for 
  money essentially is the transaction and and in that case 
  verifiable credential become actually the whole the whole payment 
  system for almost everything we do online so I mean my vision for 
  verifiable credentials is large and expansive I mean I think that 
  can be used for.
Phil Long:   Almost everything that we do when we're.
Phil Long:  Ring data online you know we're probably not going to 
  use them to transfer movies around but you know short of those 
  kind of large Globs of data almost everything we exchange online 
  could be inside of a verifiable credential and there's going to 
  be so many Niche to use cases in companies that can go into those 
  niches and serve those niches yeah I mean I know there are 
  companies doing supply chain there are companies doing you know 
  concert tickets.
Phil Long:   And all of these.
Phil Long:  The companies are doing but they're barely scratching 
  the surface you know I'm old enough to have been around in the 
  90s and built an e-commerce company called I'm all which was 
  fairly successful this still feels like the 1990s to me you know 
  hopefully we're not going to have the big crash of 2000 in our 
  future but it still feels like the 90s right people just thinking 
  of use cases but so much yet to be discovered and done.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I couldn't agree more like I actually do 
  believe that payments is actually one facet of our identity 
  systems and that's why I'm here actually but are there any one 
  last question from me before we tie open up to the audience but 
  is there is there any like new developments in the space that 
  you're most most except excited about.
Phil Long:  Clicker question I don't know that I can think of a 
  brand new development that that's got me excited to be I think 
  what I'm most excited about is the use cases that I see 
  developing and just quietly you know I'll talk to somebody at IW 
  or online and I'll say oh we're doing this with verifiable 
  credentials or and I'll think oh that's cool I didn't know 
  anybody was doing that and so I think that's probably what has me 
  the most excited it's just.
Phil Long:   You know the various use.
Phil Long:  People are trying out.
Harrison_Tang: Cool thank you so just want to open up the 
  audience you have any questions just type in q+ and I will 
  moderate the conversation but before we get to those questions we 
  actually promised people that will give out actually thanks to 
  Phil will give out of five people of Books five free ebooks feels 
  books to the audience and we actually ran the just random 
  randomly generator random generator and then.
Harrison_Tang:  we got chandi chandi Kumar.
<chandi_cumaranatunge> Wow!
Harrison_Tang: Just sorry I don't want to put your name Alan carp 
  Rob lot of fear that makarand young Gelman so if you guys don't 
  mind just emailed me at Harrison as Spokeo.com will send you the 
  free ebook after this call after you email me but thank you 
  thanks for for actually attending this this meeting all right any 
  questions.
<manu_sporny> I love the ebook giveaway!
<vanessa> harrison@spokeo.com
Phil_L_(P1): Yes I feel when Lee question is I know that Apple 
  has been pretty resistant about opening up their their credential 
  wallet and has settled on the mdl API for inclusion of 
  credentials for their pilots with the driver's license or in a 
  couple of states around the us but has been unwilling to consider 
  other support for other apis that are more friendly.
Phil_L_(P1):  e to the verifiable credential world so I was a 
  little.
Phil_L_(P1): Just about the comment that from what I can see 
  those particular vendors and I know apples pushing a Google 
  pretty hard to follow their suit which is only used that one API 
  into their wallet and not others I'm just curious in your comment 
  about whether that is something you see as a futile last few 
  steps to try to avoid that openness or is that really.
Phil_L_(P1):  Ali a serious concern.
Phil_L_(P1): Yes thank you.
Phil Long:  Another identity Pioneer who we lost recently was a 
  guy named Craig Burton who was one of the founders of Nobel and 
  you know most of you are probably way too young to remember the 
  network Wars but essentially Novell one the wet Network Wars and 
  the way they did that was with a philosophy or strategy the Craig 
  Burton came up with called Embrace and extend another way to 
  think about it is and not or.
Phil Long:   And so.
Phil Long:  At the fact that a state you know say Maryland or 
  Utah puts their drivers license in the Apple wallet doesn't 
  necessarily mean that they won't also be willing to issue 
  verifiable credentials representing their drivers licenses and I 
  think that's our that's our in right that's what we need to do 
  now I'm talking specifically about driver's licenses and that's 
  not necessarily the big.
Phil Long:   Thing although it is something that people.
<phil_l_(p1)> So address this at the issuer end not the wallet
Phil Long:  Attention to yeah I think that the point there is 
  that just because somebody's putting their credential in the 
  Apple wallet or the Google Wallet doesn't mean they might not 
  also be willing to issue credentials to other wallets if we make 
  it easy for them to do so and that there's a reason to do so and 
  so that's part of the way that we compete is you know Apple and 
  Google obviously have their Network effects with Android and iOS 
  we also.
Phil Long:   So can leverage Network effects which.
Phil Long:  And when people get a driver's license or get a movie 
  ticket or get whatever they might have a choice and they might 
  say well you know I've got all my other credentials here and I 
  really would like to use my you know bank ID and my driver's 
  license together you know so if we can you know help get that 
  mindset across I think we actually can compete.
Harrison_Tang: Money your next on the queue.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah it thank you filled this is has been wonderful 
  as always always really enjoy hearing your thoughts on the 
  identity industry I guess the the it follows on to fill long's a 
  previous question I mean one of the things that I'm really 
  concerned about is Big Tech lock in right I mean in you covered 
  part of this it's and I think it's a really good suggestion you 
  know maybe we go at this in.
Manu Sporny:   In talk to the issuers and don't become so 
  concerned.
Manu Sporny:  Learned about you know Apple wallet lock in what 
  other tactics do you feel would be useful for us as kind of an 
  industry to employ to avoid the Annette you know the inevitable 
  attempt to kind of lock this technology to Big Tech.
Phil Long:  Yes yeah I mean I can't say that I necessarily have 
  the winning strategy if I did I probably wouldn't tell it to you 
  I'd probably start a company and do it you know with that in mind 
  I mean I think that one of the things that we can Leverage is the 
  flexibility that wallets based on standards provide to us and you 
  know just.
Phil Long:   And build it.
Phil Long:  Additional capabilities rather than just right now 
  wallets are pretty simple right and that's okay I get where we're 
  at but when I think about where wallets are now and where wallets 
  could be right with Automation and being able to save me time 
  when I use my you know driver's license or whatever right I mean 
  if we can think about that in terms of user experience right 
  what's what's that great user experience and how do we build in 
  flexibility so that.
Phil Long:   You know different.
<mprorock> i have to jump - thanks Phil!
Phil Long:  Is and people can build different Technologies which 
  are inner about interoperable and have a consistent user 
  experience that then I think we make an SSI wallet much more 
  valuable now whether that's you know like I said I don't 
  necessarily think people are going to go either or you know I 
  think you know most people on this call of Delta gave them a 
  choice between putting their you know boarding pass in the Apple 
  wallet and an SSI well we prognosis I wallet because we're all.
Phil Long:   All you know kind of biased but I think most people 
  will just.
Phil Long:  In their apple while it because that's what they're 
  used to but if we give them other capabilities and other choices 
  they'll be trying things they'll say oh this is convenient and 
  that's that's I think the strategy like I said embracing extent 
  let's just let's just say okay yeah the driver's license is over 
  there the movie tickets are a good let's just do more of what we 
  can do.
Manu Sporny: +1 To embrace and extend -- great suggestion, Phil!
Harrison_Tang: Thanks Phil any last questions.
<kaliya_identitywoman> That is a great parting message "do more 
  of what we can do"
Harrison_Tang: Fulfilled one last question to so that you can 
  help us bring this home who are the kind of the top three 
  predictions that you have for the future of digital identity.
Phil Long:  Well my first prediction is that iiw will last 
  another seven years so that we can get to iw50 its kind of 
  tongue-in-cheek but yeah that's that's that's my primary goal 
  right is to get to iw50 because you know I use Roman numerals for 
  their really want to say iwl but anyway that's like I said that's 
  kind of tongue-in-cheek I think we're going to.
Phil Long:   To see an explosion in.
<manu_sporny> IIW will definitely be around for another 7 years
Phil Long:  Types of verifiable credentials and start to see the 
  kinds of use cases that make them really interesting and useful 
  and I think we'll start to see you know some verifiable 
  credential infrastructure which makes it feel less I don't want 
  to I don't want to say the wrong thing makes it feel less risky 
  for some companies I think there's a hesitancy.
Phil Long:  One problem of course like I said is that you know P 
  some people just don't understand it but there's also a hesitancy 
  just because you know when you're not familiar with something and 
  you don't see you know the kinds of infrastructure you might be 
  expecting I think people kind of hold up I think that's what's 
  changing right as we're starting to see lots of great companies 
  come up offering you know great offerings for company for other 
  companies to build verifiable credential products on for specific 
  use cases so I think.
Phil Long:   Verifiable credentials.
Phil Long:  In the rising I think I think we're going to see a 
  lot more of that the stack of thing goes back to the wallets I 
  think we're going to see a lot of innovation around wallet space 
  and you know a lot of this is probably going to be open source or 
  you know people doing it as Hobbies but you know we've seen in 
  software world that Hobbies can turn out great products right and 
  often those Inspire companies to build build.
Phil Long:   Their own which are which are equally as great so I 
  think to the extent.
Phil Long:  That we catch.
Phil Long:  Vision of the wallet is a core piece of technology 
  for forgiving people autonomy in their online relationships and 
  you know I think that going beyond that or maybe you know pulling 
  back from it because I mean that's pretty aspirational it's more 
  than just giving people autonomy because people you know 
  obviously people like that when you say it but that's not the 
  reason people buy stuff you know people buy stuff for the for 
  the.
Phil Long:   The features I've always said privacy.
Phil Long:  Right you have to give them all the things they want 
  plus privacy same things true with the cape it with autonomy if 
  you give them everything they want plus autonomy right so that 
  they get new use cases better use cases better things that they 
  can do that's that's I think what's really going to drive this so 
  I don't know if that was three it might have only been two but 
  that's kind of what I'm thinking.
Phil Long:  Great to be with all of you.
Harrison_Tang: No perfect I think the same like oldies 
  decentralization things in what three I think is it's a great 
  bullet point but it shouldn't be your main value proposition so I 
  actually agree with your analogy there alright so thank you Phil 
  thanks for hopping on and actually answer these questions thanks 
  a lot and.
<manu_sporny> THank you Phil!
Harrison_Tang: We're at time but before we kind of and just 
  wanted to quickly give a quick overview of the upcoming meetings 
  so next Tuesday it's July 4th that the Tuesday after that we will 
  have Hank one of the authors of Seaboard concise binary options 
  object representation hopping on to kind of talk about everything 
  she bore and then after that we have decentralized hi Daddy 
  Foundation kind of coming here and then give you an overview 
  about what they are working.
Harrison_Tang:  working on and after that verifiable credentials 
  cord.
Harrison_Tang: So the UK are interesting interested in learning 
  all about these just feel free to hop on our call at the same 
  time 9:00 a.m. Pacific 12 people 12 p.m. eastern time every 
  Tuesday alright thanks a lot.
Harrison_Tang:  thanks Phil.
<phil_windley> Thanks everyone!
