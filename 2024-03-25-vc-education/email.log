<susan_stroud> Good morning!
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> In case you missed the email notification, 
  please note that the meeting starts in 60 minutes, due to the 
  mismatch of summer time clock changes. Apologies about the 
  inconvenience.
<eric_shepherd> One idea would be to provide times in UTC and we 
  can use that within our calendars
<kaliya_identity_woman> this is really lame....honestly.  We have 
  been on the new time here in north america for 2 weeks. Europe 
  just joiend us on summer time...and well we should be on the same 
  time now.
<eric_shepherd> UTC = Coordinated Universal Time
<eric_shepherd> Okay - thank you

FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Yeah thank you go so my name is f b I'm 
  the founder of Primus money which is it company uh we were 
  originally specialized on ethereum blockchains and for the past 
  year we've been working on verifiable credentials and as you go 
  mentioned in the employment credential cluster so and this is 
  where we developed solution and so I understand that the 
  discussion will be more on the data model and uh schemas of the 
  verifiable credential that we have been using.
Kristen_Franklin,_Digital_Promise: Hello everyone happy Monday my 
  name is Kristen Franklin I'm the associate director of uh product 
  at digital promise which is a us-based education nonprofit we sit 
  at the intersection of uh researchers and developers and a 
  practitioner networks to really um improve access to Great 
  education everywhere so we're an equity Equity based nonprofit 
  and um and really excited to be here uh this is my very first um.
Kristen_Franklin,_Digital_Promise: Uh dbc3 um presentation so I'm 
  excited to be here thank you for having me.
Phil_Long_(T3): Uh this is Phil from the T3.
Phil_Long_(T3): Am I Audible.
Phil_Long_(T3): Thank you um just a reminder for those in the US 
  that are thinking about attending the trusted learner network uh 
  April 3rd and 4th the afternoon of the third is a presentation by 
  the T3 and um Innovation Network and the US Chamber of Commerce 
  foundation on the work-related credentials associated with.
Phil_Long_(T3): Um the efforts that are underway here for the uh 
  so-called lar ecosystem.
Phil_Long_(T3): We'll be talking about um the uh a guide and uh 
  resource library for those that are in the process of 
  implementing such systems as well as um the link claims um 
  approach that um Demetri zagadou and I.
Phil_Long_(T3): And uh um.
Phil_Long_(T3): Uh gold of Alles have been working on to allow 
  for self asserted credentials to be authored from a web-based 
  user interface and related topics so that's April 3 uh in the US 
  in Phoenix Arizona associated with ASU stress of burner Network 
  thank you.
<sharon_leu> @Phil - If people can't attend, is there any way for 
  them to learn more and see some of the resources?
Kaliya Young:  Hi we've got um iiw coming up in April.
Kaliya Young:  Um which uh has lots of stuff happening around it 
  um I have really good news uh we have our Africa.
Kaliya Young: https://didunconf.africa/
Kaliya Young:  Uh Regional event site live so I'm going to share 
  the URL for that um coming up in september June we have digital 
  identity unconference Europe in Zurich and september not 
  september January 2025 will be in.
<phil_long_(t3)> TLN info:
<phil_long_(t3)> @sharon We'll be releasing the initial draft of 
  parts of the Guide and Resource Library at the meeting and these 
  will be publicly available at that time on the T3 hub website 
  https://t3networkhub.org
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> :+1:
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: So uh we will be talking about the 
  certificate of work and certificate of work is actually when you 
  have left the company and that you get so the jurisdictions in 
  the different country can be different but more or less it's kind 
  of always the same idea is that the company is most often obliged 
  to to give you a document stating that you have worked in what 
  position you have been with the company.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney:  so but employment credential is 
  something is.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Was okay today it's maybe 1 of the big 
  source of credentials because you have a different aspect which 
  is when you are still an employee you often ask for what we call 
  an employment attestation so there is a difference with the 
  certificate of Works meaning that the employer is at testing that 
  you are still an employee.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: And you are using that in your 
  relationship with for example Banks or land loans so meaning that 
  these documents and the another 1 which is the salary slip is 
  definitely an attestation that the companies are producing in in 
  mass and that people are definitely needing to uh to get a good 
  credit score to a bank or to a landlord.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: So this is where we have this uh 
  situation where when you are in the company you are receiving a 
  potentially a lot of credentials but today it's usually in the 
  form of a PDF.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: And we do have a lot of fraud on this 
  kind of PDF.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Particular on the salary slip where 
  people will change their their wedge uh or even you know in the 
  position that they have in the company the the the they use some 
  uh uh blank paint and change some names and some uh uh.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: For the certificate of work this is 
  where uh in fact you are living in the company and there is uh.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Usually a low defining exactly what 
  should be in this document.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: And uh when we make the connection with 
  the uh the education this is where in fact the diplomats kind of 
  like a certificate of work.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: But it's more kind of you have a 
  background where you have a a more uniformity on the semantics 
  but maybe you have less of a uniformity on the structure of the 
  document itself meaning that usually you you have to give your 
  name and and first name like in a diploma but you know you have 
  to provide some definite uh elements because you are uh you have 
  to prove by law that these people person has been an employee.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: So this is where we uh.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Went into this situation where we we 
  have the the the double aspect of the certificate of work is 
  something that is very standardized and that we could put into uh 
  a schema.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: But the semantic within the schema 
  could be different from 1 company to another to another for 
  example the the uh definition of a job position okay there is a 
  practice where you tend to uh uh have a a common practice among 
  people but you can have some uh uh difference from uh 1 company 
  to another you know uh Google calling that an expert in 
  technology and someone calling that an architect or something 
  else.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: This is where we uh produced uh a 
  schema so that we can have a certificate of work you know in a 
  proper form but we are still facing this discussion about how 
  people will uh feed this document and 1 important aspect is that 
  I mentioned that there is a lot of PDF that are produced today 
  meaning that the companies usually have a production of 
  attestation in PDF format format that is already there so we we 
  more have to think of how we can plug on an existing uh pipeline 
  of data more than kind of come and say that you have to change 
  everything into your Erp because usually the data that we are 
  talking about are coming from an Erp so this is where.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: We took to a company and saying that 
  you have to touch to an Erp this is a no-go from the start.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Uh and so this is where I will maybe 
  hand over the the the the discussion to Hugo because I mentioned 
  the certificate of work which is a bit like a diploma and saying 
  that it's a way for you to to prove that you have acquired some 
  experience and that is kind of an experience that you had you 
  know in the past uh but this is where you know you have also a 
  lot of attestation which are produced within a company and so 1 
  of the as testation that we have not experienced or experimented 
  you know in the employment credential stream but we are thinking 
  about this for example the performance evaluation.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney:  so this.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: This is where.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Are producing a lot of data you know 
  and structured data with this uh performance uh evaluation and 
  this is where something this data are not used today Beyond you 
  know having your performance review and your potentially the 
  bonus that you have at the end of the year so and this is where 
  so Hugo mentioned that okay there is a an ongoing Trend saying 
  that there is also a lot of uh uh training the internal training 
  and this is where micro credentials could be a way to uh uh 
  capture those uh data and put them into a format that an employee 
  can leverage to uh uh probe is a professional experience uh is 
  knowledge and things like that so maybe you go you can give a big 
  background on the micro credential in this context.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah I wanted to say uh thank you both uh for 
  uh for the introduction I think I think we're all on board here 
  in this call about the value of microcredentials uh both in terms 
  of employment certificates uh and anything else uh would would 
  you be able to uh go into details and share the data model with 
  us.
<kristen_franklin,_digital_promise> :+1:
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So what like what what your credentials look 
  like.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: So this is so for the employment sorry 
  for the certificate of work this is where we have published 
  something and that is available that has been published on FC 
  pilot site but I think that maybe if you have that at hand you go 
  you can send uh the the the full schema that we.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney:  we share.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Had to get.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Uh so this is 1 and so the important 
  aspect in this case is is a list of position that you add in the 
  company because this is kind of.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Some sort of the Experian degrees that 
  you have acquired you know throughout your uh uh.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Participation in the company so and 
  what I mentioned is that.
https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/json-schema/-/tree/main
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: You may have some semantic you know 
  issues about saying that meaning semantics in the sense that from 
  a machine point of view this is where the machine may have you 
  know sometimes difficulties to to know if this is exactly the 
  same position or not but usually when you you look from a 
  recruiter point of view this is where it's definitely something 
  that is understood so.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: So this is the the list of uh 
  occupations that are provided in the certificate of work and then 
  we have the other 1 which is the uh employment at the station.
Dmitri Zagidulin: 
  https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/json-schema/-/tree/main/schemas/vcdm2.0/multi-uni-pilot/employment-attestation
https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/json-schema/-/tree/main/schemas/vcdm2.0/multi-uni-pilot/work-certificate
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: That I briefly mentioned but that as a 
  different kind of role this is more than proving that you are 
  still in the company so it's less to do with you know proving 
  your Worth to another employer it's proving your Worth to a bank 
  or to a landlord saying that you have this kind of position so 
  meaning that you will have the means to pay the back your credit 
  uh your loan or your to pay your rent every month.
Dmitri Zagidulin: 
  https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/json-schema/-/tree/main/schemas/vcdm2.0/multi-uni-pilot/work-certificate
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So 1 thing that I noticed that uh in the 
  readme there.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That the schema is registered in The Trusted 
  schemas registry uh can you say a few words about that what what 
  is that registry.
https://hub.ebsi.eu/vc-framework/data-models/dm-registry
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: And this is where we we we fall into 
  the you know the devil is in the details and so the idea is quite 
  uh easy to understand and saying that you have a single point of 
  truth of saying that we will be using this schema so that when 
  I'm an issue I can produce you know uh using this schema and so I 
  will format my data in a way that okay verify decided to use the 
  same schema they will be able to receive the the schema and the 
  data uh with no glitches but actually this is where.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Always people adding other things 
  because for example the uh so.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: You you always have either you know.
FredericBaud-PrimusMoney: Specific laws which are local laws or 
  you have you know a practice which are National practice and you 
  will have some uh additional field and because you know the the 
  flexibility of verifiable credential allows you to have optional 
  or even you know non-specified Fields this is where you will 
  still have the the issue of.
https://europa.eu/europass/fr/news/upcoming-launch-european-learning-model-v3
<hugo_spiess_prosoon> The benefits of ELM v3:
<sharon_leu> Have you been testing the interoperability of these 
  credentials with just the EBSI early adopters or "in the wild" 
  with your verifier partners?
https://github.com/european-commission-empl/European-Learning-Model
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Sorry, I had a WiFi hick-up. I wanted to ask 
  about the simple json schema 
  https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/json-schema/-/blob/main/schemas/vcdm2.0/multi-uni-pilot/work-certificate/examples/simple.json 
  - this doesn't seem to have a reference to a specific claim or 
  knowledge/skills related to the occupation. How can you establish 
  that connection in your employment credentials?
<christoph_graf_(switch.ch)> And how does ESCO fit into this 
  picture https://esco.ec.europa.eu/ "ESCO is the multilingual 
  classification of European Skills, Competences, and Occupations"?
<phil_barker> And esco has Software Architect: 
  http://data.europa.eu/esco/occupation/d0aa0792-4345-474b-9365-686cf4869d2e
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> That sounds very exciting (the performance 
  reviews that could become verifiable claims).
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> How interesting!
<sharon_leu> Agree. And especially the connection with 
  promotions.
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> I understand why this isn't a simple 
  question.
<phil_barker> Thank you, though the question came from Christoph
<christoph_graf_(switch.ch)> Thanks ;-)
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Indeed.
<sharon_leu> Other than fraud detection, have the companies you 
  work with found other benefits?
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> To some extent in ESCO the classification is 
  already taking care of *SOME* of the occupation - skill linking, 
  but it is a little too broad, I would imagine a credential to 
  have a narrower list or related essential and optional knowledge 
  and skills.
<fredericbaud-primusmoney> I was mentioning the occupation of 
  "softwar architect", I think I could no find it (or some other 
  terms like that)
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> @sharon, I imagine maybe the underlying 
  model being multilingual is a big plus in labour mobility (across 
  borders).
<sharon_leu> That's interesting about skills transferability. 
  Employers in the US are typically more protective and don't want 
  to help staff find jobs in other companies!
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> @Frederic: 
  http://data.europa.eu/esco/occupation/d0aa0792-4345-474b-9365-686cf4869d2e 
  is the ESCO URI for software architect
<fredericbaud-primusmoney> @ildiko ok thx
<sharon_leu> Thank you!
<keying_chen> Thank you!
