Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: All right well can I go on to this Tuesday's this 
  week's w3c ccg meeting so this week we have two main Agenda 21 we 
  invited an Eco the author the SSI on blockchain is a bad idea 
  paper and to kind of share his thoughts and in addition to that 
  we would like to talk about a potential proposal.
Harrison_Tang: Potentially tweaking our Charters and I think 
  Kimberly can actually talk about that a little bit later any 
  agendas that people won't bring up.
Harrison_Tang: All right so before we get to the agendas and 
  introduction to reintroduction just want to do a quick reminder 
  on the code of ethics in summary just make sure that you know we 
  create and know maintain psychologically safe environment where 
  people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts I'm sure that 
  sometimes we don't necessarily agree with each other but that's 
  make sure that.
Harrison_Tang:  the respect is there.
Harrison_Tang: All right a quick I didn't know anyone can 
  participate in these calls however old substantive contributions 
  to any CG work items must be members of the ccg with full IP our 
  agreement sign so the links are included in the agenda email tab 
  sent out.
Harrison_Tang:  make sure you have.
Harrison_Tang: Account and and sign the w3c community contributor 
  license agreement.
Harrison_Tang: These minutes and all deal recording of everything 
  set on this car are type with at WCC GitHub meetings link we 
  actually have fixed the recording so that you can see the 
  recordings in those in those in the links that we send out we use 
  IRC to Q speakers during the call as well as to take minutes so 
  type in cubed plus to add yourself to a cute.
Harrison_Tang:  you have been questions B3.
Harrison_Tang: Remove remove your questions from the Q.
Harrison_Tang: And if you have any questions just feel free to to 
  do the Q Plus and then I will acknowledge you monitor the the 
  questions and I don't you.
Harrison_Tang: Any introductions and reintroductions.
Harrison_Tang: Anyone new to the community or haven't been active 
  and want to kind of reintroduce yourself.
Harrison_Tang: I will I will make sure that we have set aside 
  some time and for introductions reintroductions at the end of me 
  as well any announcements were reminders.
Harrison_Tang: I think it's a public service announcement that IW 
  internet and internet identity Workshop is in a November so you 
  haven't actually solved for that just sign up.
Harrison_Tang: Mike I think I have a question.
Mike Prorock: https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/115/
Mike Prorock:  Yeah actually just more of an announcement 115 ITF 
  115 is coming up I think most people are aware of that the high 
  promote stuff has been working pretty well also was sometimes 
  difficult but that's been working extremely well for the last few 
  ITF so there are items in particular skit so as citt is formed as 
  a working group now.
Mike Prorock:  Taking off during this meeting.
Mike Prorock:  Jose so JavaScript object signing corruption will 
  be performing as also there will be some stuff that has definite 
  impact particularly for the underlying Primitives we use in a lot 
  of our specs here so.
Harrison_Tang: Great thanks Mike any other announcements were 
  reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Any progress or action reports on the action 
  items.
Harrison_Tang: All right before we get to the manager and and 
  will come Nick Nico Kimberly do you want to kind of bring out the 
  the other agenda regards to the Charter.
Kimberly Linson:  Sure sure thanks Harrison so we have been 
  discussing the ccg charter and I just want to put it in in the 
  chat and also just in case folks don't.
<kimberly_wilson_linson> The mission of the W3C Credentials 
  Community Group is to explore the creation, storage, 
  presentation, verification, and user control of credentials. We 
  focus on a verifiable credential (a set of claims) created by an 
  issuer about a subject—a person, group, or thing—and seek 
  solutions inclusive of approaches such as: self-sovereign 
  identity; presentation of proofs by the bearer; data 
  minimization; and centralized, federated, and decentralized 
  registry and identity systems. Our tasks include drafting and 
  incubating Internet specifications for further standardization 
  and prototyping and testing reference implementations.
Kimberly Linson:  Have it let me read it it's pretty short the 
  mission of the w3c credentials community group is to explore the 
  creation storage presentation verification and user control of 
  credentials we focus on a verifiable credential set of claims 
  created by an issuer and about a subject a person group or thing 
  and seek Solutions inclusive of approaches such as self Sovereign 
  identity presentation of proofs by the bearer data minimization 
  and.
Kimberly Linson:  Decentralized registry and identity systems are 
  tasks include Drafting and incubating internet specifications for 
  further standardization and prototyping and testing reference 
  implementations so the the that Charter definitely I think gives 
  a good sense of what we do here but it doesn't make any mention 
  of dids or of the VC standard and that has.
Kimberly Linson:  Create some real confusion in the community at 
  large outside of ccg to the point where they're actually worsen 
  folks start starting a community group to talk about dids and so 
  we've begun to just sort of wonder about whether or not we need 
  to add something to our Charter about the work that we are doing 
  in those areas and but before we really started drafting.
Kimberly Linson:  Or adding to the Charter we wanted to just 
  bring it to you all as a community and get your feedback and 
  input about whether or not you think this change is even 
  necessary so I just like to open it to the Florida to have 
  questions and discussion around around that.
<mprorock> /me thinks likely some minor additions to call out 
  those TRs since the existing charter predates standardization
Kimberly Linson:  Anybody feel strongly about not changing the 
  the charter to include those things.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Yeah I don't 
  feel strongly about it but it does seem apparent that it's 
  necessary given that there was another group already starting to 
  try to have a conversation that we are already having.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Not sure what 
  shape that adjustment needs to be whether it actually needs to be 
  a charter change or simply acknowledging the fact that we 
  produced the original dids Etc or the pre working group document 
  that went into the working group.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Yeah so to 
  try to be a little clearer because I'm a little not awake today.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Summarizing 
  the work that has been done here and the work that is ongoing 
  does not seem to me to require to change the charter it just 
  needs to be documented so there might be an informative section 
  of the charter as opposed to normative and we could do that I 
  think pretty instantly.
Kimberly Linson:  Thanks that that would be great.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah it's going to note Ted that's actually a 
  great thought about kind of some non normative language one of 
  the things that shares have been running into as we can't 
  actually edit the ccg page so we're chasing that down and trying 
  to find out why that that anything under Steve.
Mike Prorock:  There we go cool but yeah that's that's an 
  excellent so we've got kind of a parallel item to see if w3c 
  staff actually help date the community group page itself and that 
  looks to be the case but we're getting some details on that Ted 
  so.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I would just like to add that the church has 
  to receive like I think one or two feedback in regards to the 
  current Charter being a little bit for like Maritime confusing it 
  is quite worthy and so so the feedback was if we could actually 
  simplify and clarify it further so it's not a specific so yeah so 
  I think adding VCS or he bids like those kind of.
Harrison_Tang:  villages like is something that's.
Harrison_Tang: Right because for example verifiable credentials 
  is gaining quite a bit of more and more recognition so that we 
  could help no kind of help clarify what we do here but I think 
  more or less the main thing is about clean up the language to 
  more for like baritone understand right for people who are not as 
  familiar with this community.
Kimberly Linson:  Yes this process of going through the the new 
  proposed Charter would give us the opportunity to to to make 
  edits to the whole thing so that's definitely it I thought too.
Kimberly Linson:  So unless anyone is is strongly objecting my 
  next ask is for anybody who's interested in sort of volunteering 
  to to look at the language and provide some suggestions.
Kimberly Linson:  And I you can raise your hand here if you want 
  to or you can just reach out to me separately and we can talk 
  about how we're going to going to move forward with looking at 
  the language and Ted I would definitely appreciate your your 
  historical wisdom on you know what what is non-normative that 
  would be great so.
Kimberly Linson:  Any other questions or comments about this.
Kimberly Linson:  Thank you so much.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Kimberly all right any other 
  announcements or reminders or agenda that people won't bring up.
Harrison_Tang: All right so let's get to the main agenda talking 
  about SSI on blockchain so three months ago I read a great 
  research paper by Nico actually the back story is I was just / 
  using kolya's news newsletter and then I saw this article and I 
  read deeper into it I found it very very insightful and very very 
  thorough so that we're very very pleased to accept.
Harrison_Tang: Leading by Nico the off.
Harrison_Tang: Are too tight.
Harrison_Tang: Talk about SFI on blockchain and his insights from 
  his research now I know SSI Block Chain work three you know where 
  the intersection of all these topics and hype terms as being that 
  debated Topic in this community for the past few years so so I 
  think you know it's going to be interesting right to actually 
  have me Cole kind of bring his perspective and share your 
  thoughts so anyway so without further Ado I'll just welcome.
Harrison_Tang:  mmm Nico to to the floor and then kind of.
Harrison_Tang: Start by kind of sharing what he found right and 
  he's thoughts in regards to why SSI on block changes might be a 
  bad idea thank you Nico.
Niko: Yeah hi I'm Nico I'm a site reliability engineer rather 
  large IT company to prefer to leave unnamed and yeah thanks for 
  the reduction thanks for inviting me here I my interest is mainly 
  in blockchain not necessarily SSI was the more of a bit of an 
  accident I guess so apologies.
Niko: If I get like some.
Niko: You're wrong additionally maybe just one more thing before 
  I get started here I woke up with a sore throat if I do lose my 
  voice or cough the middle of the talk my apologies so I'll start 
  with like summarizing sort of just going just really quick to my 
  background and the then summarizing the main points of the 
  article I'll see if I can hit some of the 15-minute Mark 
  approximately.
Niko:  so my.
<harrison_tang> Link to Niko's research:  
  https://weh.wtf/ssi.html
Niko: My at work and focus on distributed databases and privacy 
  engineering and in a previous life I used to work in fintech so 
  there is a bit of a like I guess I have a bit of a presupposition 
  for blockchain crypto stuff that my interest is mostly in 
  blockchain less the crypto aspects of that sort of ecosystem I 
  got really sucked into in quotes into the blockchain stuff around 
  like.
Niko:  2016-2017 I played around with.
Niko: System then around 16 17 I started like started comparing 
  so blockchain as a tech stack with my work experience in critical 
  big Tech and I started to realize that I struggled both myself 
  and also like trying to figure out how to do that but also like 
  getting information other people how to do that how to surf apply 
  the blockchain tech stack to the.
Niko:  problems that I was seeing.
Niko: In my day-to-day work experience anything from 
  functionality privacy compliance policy scaling usability 
  blockchain seem to be lacking functionality not just a bit and 
  like you know like hey there's like because the new technology 
  there's just like chunks missing but like fundamental issues with 
  the technology so it kept getting involved like the blockchain 
  engineering discussions and eventually it took me five years I 
  guess get that point but eventually I started.
Niko: Actually writing things down into a blog post or blog posts 
  I guess the key point in that blog post is I generally really 
  like the idea of self-similarity oh one more thing I'm speaking 
  as this is my personal opinion not the one of my employer who may 
  or may not have a single sign-on product I personally really like 
  the idea of decentralizing these kind of things I think this is a 
  the hi.
Niko:  a centralization of.
Niko: Identity Services is a present and relevant problem that 
  needs addressing but I also don't see how blockchain is needed I 
  don't think blockchain helps the user and I do think blockchain 
  slows adoption of south of an identity and it requires it makes 
  it creates much more problems than it actually solves I think a.
Niko: That I found that also citing the blog is the European 
  Union covid vaccine passport which to my knowledge use the w3c 
  verifiable credentials and initially when they were trying to set 
  this up and getting free but then like they try to put this on 
  blockchain they failed then they removed the blockchain parts and 
  with reasonable decentralization like individual countries issue 
  like the certificates and pharmacies they managed to scale this 
  up to 2 billion certificates.
Niko: In a way this is kind of the QR code on paper is kind of 
  The Benchmark that it away blockchain needs to reach and I think 
  a lot of effort is from from at least this hopefully the research 
  that I've done and like the approach that I've seen a lot of 
  effort is trying to is done to try to make blockchain work as 
  good as a QR code on paper now we'll say I have.
Niko: Like this is not something as SSI.
Niko: Other projects like Logistics or social media have very 
  similar problems when you know blockchain gets involved the 
  reason why I wrote about SSI specifically is simply because that 
  blog post was done first and then I got married and bought a 
  house in didn't have time to finish the other ones actually okay 
  okay so I'm going to go through like the main sort of advantages 
  that I often saw sighted in.
Niko: You know blockchain deal to Integrations I'm going to go 
  over these rather quickly and like I'm very happy to answer more 
  in-depth questions during the Q&A later so once the things have 
  often comes up is that anything really or just identifiers or 
  verify your credentials on a blockchain are inherently more 
  trusted for some reason I really barely ever found that claim 
  substantiated.
Niko:  way and it doesn't really make sense on a high level.
Niko: If anyone can ride to a deal T than the fact that it is on 
  a deal t or a blockchain doesn't add anything like trust by 
  itself right vice versa like if you have a centralized I could 
  permission blockchain well you really kind of don't get any of 
  the supposed advantages of blockchain Technologies like the trust 
  is now delegated to the operator of that say hyperledger 
  instance.
Niko: I think Sovereign is an example of a company that does that 
  like okay well but now they affect the gate the what is on that 
  block chain or not a similar argument often comes up with that 
  the issuer's of the certificate like say like governments or 
  universities for example our more trusted through having their 
  certificates being on the blockchain but the same argument holds 
  here too right if anyone can ride to it it doesn't really trust 
  if only.
Niko:  you people can write to it they trust just delegated and 
  we have the same mole.
Niko: Pki structure that you have today in browsers like Chrome 
  or Safari wear a company or very few entities decide who is 
  trusted or not so the second sort of bigger Point like that of 
  advantages are forgery resistance to quote us a from some 
  Sovereign white paper I think there's the thing that the argument 
  that the blockchain can tell you which certificate is the most 
  recent one but.
Niko:  this is.
Niko: Hard to get right in a privacy-preserving way but I'm sure 
  there's like odd edge cases like domain TLS certificates would be 
  something where this is possible and this is also done using the 
  certificate transparency but for the average use case of like say 
  you know something that is clearly linked to a person let's use a 
  password as an example this does not work in the 
  privacy-preserving way right because if.
Niko:  whew if you.
Niko: He bought notifications have distracted me very quick if 
  you want to check whether there is a second copy like a second 
  passport in my name on The Ledger that requires some way of 
  looking up in The Ledger whether you know for Nicole IV there is 
  a second passport in The Ledger now this is clearly a GDP Our 
  concern or.
Niko:  no violation if.
Niko: Change or remove that entry GTR requires me to be able to 
  erase or Rectify any kind of data that is stored by end any 
  entity that is linkable to me and the the the answer to that that 
  often comes up is I will just use zero-knowledge proves but that 
  doesn't really change the fundamental issue I'd like as someone 
  who verifies my.
Niko:  identity that.
Niko: Needs to be.
Niko: Able to look up whether there's a fraudulent copy of that 
  ID given some attributes that are clearly linked to me that is 
  the GDP our relation if you wrap that in zero-knowledge proves it 
  doesn't really change the fact I think if I am happy to talk 
  about GPR been more during the Q&A it actually is much worse than 
  that and there's lots of legal uncertainty even when it comes to 
  bitcoin transactions because these are technically linkable to 
  individuals to.
Niko:  another related thing to forgery.
Niko: I'm stabbing and verified time stamping is one of those 
  things where there's at least somewhat of a technical argument 
  that is you'll start at here's a problem and here's the solution 
  how we address this which frankly is something I was had a really 
  hard time finding for a lot of other you know blockchain and 
  aside equations so verify time setting effectively gives you an 
  operand or lower Bound for when a document was issued but it's 
  included.
Niko:  in the Merkle tree and some deal T so you just kind of.
Niko: When the blocks are the mark on the roads were were issued 
  now this kind of sounds useful and certificate transparency for 
  example does that too but it's also really hard at least for me 
  to come up with a concrete example like a an actual real world 
  use case where this makes sense if you go for the through the 
  passport model for example right the this would only be useful 
  if.
Niko:  you have it passport in your hand and you.
Niko: Name a color date of birth the ID government ID number the 
  issuance date only passport expiration date on the passport but 
  somehow what you really don't trust really want to verify is when 
  that passport was printed right this this just doesn't really 
  seem like a real life use case to me and you know furthermore 
  like the issuer could just create multiple copies which you can't 
  detect these.
Niko:  of the fraud.
Niko: Like the forgery proof problems that we just discussed and 
  also time stepping service already exists right there's rc30 161 
  you can also use dkim it's just barely used because I don't think 
  this problem everybody comes up in practice another issue that is 
  also very related to the forgery thing is there are very valid 
  reasons for back data.
Niko:  Ting documents for core.
Niko: Forge documents this can be anything from you know victims 
  of domestic violence that changed their name there's people going 
  to witness protection program people that transition genders or 
  just like a plain old typo right shining a spotlight on your 
  here's the digital identity that has been modified somehow can 
  you know I want to go like the full-length Road I'm going to say 
  like this can put like people's life in danger but.
Niko:  it certainly.
Niko: It was more of a nuanced discussion so just just just going 
  like oh well just like having a hard proof that this is accurate 
  like does kind of doesn't really need the reality of the 
  complexities of the situation I think so the last of two main 
  points were is like Reliance on third parties and whether you own 
  your data and I don't think either of these two things hold 
  either I don't I think the Reliance on third parties.
Niko:  is actually kind of.
Niko: Your smartphone is not realistically going to restore full 
  copy of a blockchain system that scales to say like 300 million 
  American Gillette at digital identifiers unification stored is 
  looking to maintain like live updates of that so you will have to 
  rely on some third party API that manage the blockchain for you 
  which right now if you look at these sort of ecosystem.
Niko:  mm of.
Niko: Third-party gateways in the cryptocurrency or like watching 
  ecosystem you have in Ferrara which is kind of implicated in the 
  censorship around what's calling in the tornado cash thing for 
  example and and these part third parties have their own Financial 
  incentives right they can they can serve you wrong missing and 
  delayed data if you know they think this makes them more money 
  right there's there's plenty of.
Niko:  examples in these sort of payment ecosystem.
Niko: Are credit card companies just like even if there's no 
  regulatory like direct reason to ban a provider they just don't 
  want to deal with the pr of it I like erotic content sites are 
  the common examples only-- fans for example we're paying 
  providers just like shut them down so you have like you're 
  effectively putting your trust in at this point unregulated API 
  gateways so it's not that the Reliance on third parties decreases 
  here at the owner.
Niko:  data argument finally is I just don't.
Niko: If you're broadcasting your data onto a public Ledger 
  everyone owns it are including all of big tag and all of the NSA 
  and other secret Services you can't read Elite from it I mean 
  like if if your threat model is that big tag or the NSA is 
  listening to you in grabbing your data then now your threat model 
  not only increases from does not only contain a this one big Tech 
  that you store.
Niko:  your daughter with.
Niko: It includes all big tax and all worldwide Secret Service as 
  I had the common argument that people like oh like what this is 
  not a problem is we'll just use encryption but that's orthogonal 
  to blockchain step right if you're if you encrypt your data in a 
  way that it's safe enough to put it on a public blockchain so 
  that it's safe like it's defensible against every Secret Service 
  and every big tag then it's safe enough for Dropbox it can put it 
  on Dropbox and in addition you get.
Niko:  gdpr enforcement against Dropbox you can sue.
Niko: They mishandled your daughter you don't get channeled 
  attics mad on Alice's which is something you also get on public 
  blockchains Weather Channel it is business model is you know the 
  anonymizing people this clearly is a threat so I did the own your 
  data argument just just does not I just cannot see how this works 
  so the the these are the supposed conquered good sides.
Niko:  but you also get done as.
Niko: Integrate into a system get additional complexity right you 
  get cost you got Dev time compliance and I've made that semi joke 
  before that a lot of times being spent making guilty work as good 
  as it QR code printed on a piece of paper and I found a lot of 
  projects that were stuck in this phase really like a lot of 
  problems are working trying to work around the GPR issues around 
  the we can't delete things and.
Niko:  you get an online request.
Niko: I meant for example if you're if you want your ID checks 
  and you're in some say Berlin Underground club where there's no 
  or Pruitt reception but your QR code and papers going to work 
  your blockchain enabled thing that needs like an internet 
  connection was not if you have a big fast for the desert for 
  example some of the countryside where the Internet is slow or 
  broken you'll run into the same problems for public Ledger's you 
  have transaction costs and of course you have gdpr and 
  meta-analysis privacy problems.
Niko:  so none of these problems these are.
Niko: Our would be deal breakers if they were offset by actual 
  advantages but again I am having a really hard time finding those 
  so I'm gonna go go really quick about the digital part because I 
  think the literal part is resisting me going through various you 
  know there is a blog posts and academic literature going from 
  actually trying to extract information to just be.
Niko:  at times with Moody and ran.
Niko: Unfortunately poor quality of some of the Articles just to 
  give you a one or two examples like the ab c-- the European Bloc 
  10 Initiative for example like there if you dig into the 
  documentation far enough you finally find a diagram where they 
  describe how they're using the a deal T and they use it for 
  rights only there's only arrows that right.
Niko:  The Ledger no.
Niko: It's from it at the time I looked at least maybe they added 
  something but at the time that was all there was IBM says on 
  their blogs that you know their blockchain to Grace will avoid 
  third parties but they ignore that you know almost all their 
  blockchain products require that you log in through ibm.com when 
  ibm.com login which is you know bit of a third party there's I 
  think my favorite one was Forbes like one of the biggest like 
  first Google results when you Google for.
Niko:  or like blockchain as I was a Forbes article.
Niko: They claim that the idea on the LT will allow that online 
  shopping will be delivered to wherever you are at the moment 
  which I thought was the do substantiate that's like that clay 
  let's put it that way I found similar results on a slightly 
  higher level on some of the the academic literature I will say 
  there's a there's a ton of research like articles here and 
  obviously I didn't go through all of them went through the top 
  five results.
Niko:  top five most.
Niko: Will scholarly subject but I found similar results to the 
  blog articles where there's a lot of claims that are simply than 
  not followed up on or substantiate some of the academic 
  literature at least pointed out some of the same problems that I 
  mentioned it before I think my favorite my favorite point there 
  was that one of the papers claim that that deal T would.
Niko:  wow in some cases.
Niko: Real-time proof of correctness for example that you're not 
  a terrorist when when you checking into the airport and I thought 
  there was a I didn't know finding out whether someone's a 
  terrorist is as easy as putting that into a that piece of data 
  into a blockchain and I went through a couple of real-world 
  projects I found like some of them from the blog post and the 
  articles that are look.
Niko:  before and I think.
Niko: I'm guessing at numbers like about the 15 projects like say 
  10 projects 7 word that to stop doing blockchain and the 
  remaining One Sovereign they effectively run a private hyper 
  Ledger instance and reached out to them because they had that one 
  example where the international Aviation Transit Authority I 
  added I think they were having a partnership with them and I 
  reach out to them like how does do they use blockchain.
Niko:  and then they effectively admitted that while they don't.
Niko: They run their own whatever like centralized database and 
  we just you know give them a copy of our internal hyper Ledger 
  instance like a data dump and they play that into their database 
  they also said that they are exploring other options other than 
  deities of the kind of moving away from it to the real world 
  projects I mentioned earlier that like at this is not necessarily 
  a society specific these only second article that I wrote on the 
  my blog was that it looked into a total of 34 critical real-life 
  blockchain projects.
Niko:  and I found exactly the same results across the board with 
  other non SSI.
Niko: So to summarize I think SSI is an extremely interesting 
  area of research I think this is a thing that has solves a 
  problem that is present as it had before but there's plenty of 
  hard problems right like that things like from like you know 
  privacy matter results that's how you deal with identity theft 
  how you make it work for Tech a literate people which is really 
  sort of the main anti SSI argument.
Niko:  that I see from my friend Circle.
Niko: Interesting fun and challenging problems and I again I am 
  biased here because like I am from these sort of blockchain 
  skeptic ecosystem but I do feel a lot of work is being put into 
  making blockchain as useful as as my sequel that instead could be 
  spent on you know make it so actually solving the hard problems 
  that would benefit.
Niko:  the end user.
Niko: I hope that was was a useful summary.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Nicole any questions.
<john_kuo> That was terrific, thanks
Alan Karp:  Trying to figure out and I was trying to figure out 
  how to unmute so how do I prove ownership of the did if there 
  isn't some sort of a agreed-upon place to make that claim.
Niko: Um I mean you would you would have your private key that 
  matches the public key encoding you did right.
Alan Karp:  Right but somebody else could produce the same did 
  with a different key.
Niko: Right so this I think it goes into the forgery aspect right 
  like how do you how do you avoid that there's two dids referring 
  to the same individual right but you cannot.
Alan Karp:  No no no no two dudes referring to different I create 
  a did but Mikey have my did Doc and all that you come along and 
  use the same did but with your own key in your own did Doc and 
  now a third party comes along and doesn't know which is which.
Niko: Right what what what is what is in the in the did here 
  though like what is the thing that's that's effectively signed 
  off when you when you create the the did.
Alan Karp:  Well you know claim that I'm now in carp and I live 
  in a particular place whatever did Doc that I think that matters 
  here and then and then you claim that your alankar blue lives in 
  a different place or whatever.
<greg_bernstein> Public key in DID
<tomj> forgery can be blocked by a ipfs method - blockchain not 
  required
Niko: Right but the the the I mean that is that is a thing that I 
  can do on the blockchain to write I can just upload the did to 
  the blockchain and now there's two divs that say Alan carb on the 
  blockchain.
Alan Karp:  Right but as I understand the rules only the first 
  the first one wins.
Alan Karp:  Where are you.
Niko: The first one is determined by by what right so there's got 
  to be like a 300 million did on the blockchain and as we 
  discussed as I mentioned before for privacy reasons you cannot 
  have literally Alan carb in there or a hash of Allen card in 
  there because that would be a GDP our biology.
Alan Karp:  Right right but but if the did is going to be useful 
  at all I think you should be able to guarantee that the first one 
  to claim the did owns it and can put whatever they want and 
  they're did Doc and somebody else who comes along and cleans the 
  same did should not be recognized as owning that did.
<phil_l_(p1)> How can a person claim the same DID?  The keys are 
  unique.
Niko: Right but but again right like there there's no way to 
  determine whether there is a previous instance of that did on the 
  blockchain so the only thing that you could potentially do is 
  refer to the time stamp that is encoded in like with the did on 
  the blockchain right like so the verify time something argument.
Alan Karp:  Well it's no it's the deepest in the chain is the 
  winner.
Niko: Right but I think this is this is somewhat related to the 
  time-stamping thing right like the.
<brentz> this is why there needs to be a cryptographic binding 
  between the DID and the initial public key for that DID
Alan Karp:  Well it's order its order but it doesn't depend on 
  time it's just the first one first of all icon on it to claim the 
  did owns it.
Niko: Right so I mean in this scenario where someone is presented 
  with both that's right so if the person was just presented with 
  one of these there was no way to tell which one is the true Alan 
  carb that right.
Alan Karp:  Regulars sure there is like walk the chain see if 
  there's an earlier one now that might be computationally 
  expensive but at least it's possible.
<phil_l_(p1)> @Brenz right
Niko: But they wouldn't be able to find is like an earlier one 
  that says Alan carbon it because I.
Alan Karp:  No no wait the did the did itself is what they search 
  for.
Alan Karp:  We have two people claiming ownership of the same 
  Dead one is earlier on the Chain than the other.
Niko: Oh oh oh okay.
Niko: Right so what exactly is sorry like what exactly putting on 
  the challenge of putting the these the signature of the Dead on 
  the chain.
Alan Karp:  I'm putting the did and the public key of the dead 
  and then I can associate whatever else I want with the did Doc.
<dmitri_zagidulin> I think there's a queue?
<tomj> who is it that prevents a forgery on a blockchain?  That 
  must be a trusted entity
Niko: Right so I think this is this is still like related to the 
  trust of time stamping argument there's really there's this I got 
  a summer thoughts on party this kind of like safety mechanism 
  okay sorry I think I know what you're getting at um.
Niko: Hahaha let me think about that.
<mahmoud_alkhraishi> can we process queue? theres a number of 
  straight forward answers here.
Niko: I really like this thank you so much like this is this is 
  the kind of stuff that I was that I was not finding in the the 
  researcher I'm trying to think of like a concrete example how how 
  this comes into play though.
Niko: Sure sure absolutely so sorry for blanket here.
Harrison_Tang: Actually sorry Nico I think maybe you can 
  formulate your thoughts and then and then take it offline we have 
  other questions so thank you I will yeah thank you Alan I think 
  yeah no problem I think this this this question is specifically 
  in regards to putting pids on blockchains I think in your 
  research you mentioned about not putting personal information and 
  Pi or VCS verifiable credentials on blockchain I think that's a 
  bad idea.
Harrison_Tang:  this question is more specifically about the IDS.
Harrison_Tang: So so I think maybe we can take this Offline that 
  will have will have other other people in the cube alright so see 
  the queue Keith.
Phil_L_(P1): One two and two.
Keith Kowal:  Thanks for your presentation Nico I think it might 
  be useful go through just like a little history of credentials on 
  blockchain like in in historically there was some platforms 
  putting VCS and moist ABC's we've kind of mean Pi on blockchain I 
  guess blocks are to be good example of that but I think in the 
  last few years there's no more sets aside platforms that at least 
  no popular SI platforms that put Pi on blockchain anymore I think 
  most of us are using blockchain for things like putting.
Keith Kowal:  Which is really around key management but no pii.
Keith Kowal:  You can get into a question about the holder did 
  and and even some platforms are no longer even putting holder did 
  anything that even resembles pii is not going on blockchain 
  anymore and then we put things like schemas on blockchain 
  revocation list replication mechanism sometimes go on blockchain 
  so I think maybe it's just a progression in the industry I think 
  you cited Sovereign quite a few times like Sovereign never you 
  know they had they have a large DPI a about you know Pi on 
  blockchain is quite a lot written mean typically they were 
  putting things like.
Keith Kowal:   Issuer dids cred deaths schemas on blockchain but 
  they would never put Pi on.
Keith Kowal:  Extreme Measures to make sure that no Pi I ever 
  went on blockchain so just a couple of you know hope that.
Niko: Yeah thanks for that I I did some kind of see that too when 
  I was going through projects that you know like we're still alive 
  that Sovereign particular yes they they I saw that document where 
  they talked about avoiding Pi on blockchain but again like this 
  is your kind of starting to wonder like why is our things on 
  boxing like a revocation list for example is.
Niko:  it's going to sound like we have.
Niko: I'd like they they work good enough for realize like for 
  real life purposes I personally don't see like why you know what 
  the advantages of putting these in a blockchain for so you 
  mentioned I wanted to other things that I unfortunately missed.
Keith Kowal:  Yeah and I think that's the main conversation today 
  is those other things like particularly did schemas revocation 
  should they be on a blockchain or not I think God selects the 
  center of a lot of our conversations these days.
<tomj> once a did is bound to any pii, like for example a eid or 
  uinversity degree w/th dates and other details the privacy is 
  gone forever for that did
Niko: I do you maybe want to go back to Allen's Point real quick 
  because if I understood it correctly like you have the the 
  signature like the second Randy Daddy on some of that magic on 
  the blockchain but what happens if like you for example rotate 
  your key right one of theirs what if you create like what stops 
  me from creating a new D ID for example this has Alan Carr and 
  signed up myself that is has a different hash.
Niko: Then you know that you want that you.
Niko: That's I'm sorry I met Nation.
Alan Karp:  Yeah that's yeah that's not the issue that's fine 
  that can always happen but it's just somebody claiming a did that 
  I somebody else claiming it did that I claimed first that's the 
  issue.
Niko: But again like I'm really happy to take this offline but I 
  would love to see like a concrete example where this comes into 
  play because I think there's.
Niko: This doesn't strike me as like a real-life sort of problem 
  I think.
Harrison_Tang: All right Paul.
PaulDietrich_GS1: Yeah I just wanted to share a use case on this 
  same discussion we're having an imagine that you're in some 
  trading network of loosely connected trading partners and say a 
  partner presents me a credential and they need to prove something 
  legally before I can interact with them for global trade and then 
  you know our lives go on and then in sometime in the future or 
  regulator comes back to me and says well did you verify that 
  Partners Prudential and what proof do you have that that 
  credential verified at that specific time.
PaulDietrich_GS1: Because right now of course Keys have rotated 
  revocation list.
PaulDietrich_GS1: So what do I need to cryptographically prove 
  that yes I validated that credential at the time and I think that 
  comes back to these same two things like how is the Dig documents 
  stored in can I get a copy from that time because Keys may have 
  changed and it might have been at the time I used a key that's 
  now not in the did Doc anymore and the second is a revocation 
  list unless I keep a copy of that signed list with that 
  credential in a future time I might not be able to prove that 
  that credential was revoked or not revoked unless there's some 
  time recorded history.
PaulDietrich_GS1:  like blockchain Sony going to pass that back 
  to you as a potential way to kind of think about this as a 
  trading partner.
PaulDietrich_GS1: In the future.
PaulDietrich_GS1: I have to prove that I did validate a 
  credential that someone did pass some certificate test and what 
  do I need to do to cryptographically prove that and what is the 
  lift on me as the person who has to prove that to a regulator.
Niko: Right yeah thank you for that so the.
Niko: Time-stamping servers is is really the main answer for the 
  time recorded history these things already exists it is 
  effectively a trusted third party like did you search or Google 
  or whatever like they and any number of these affecting his 
  signing off on a time stamp this happens implicitly when you send 
  emails so really when you you know when you do internally in your 
  company have a conversation about you know verify.
Niko:  buying that.
<tomj> putting a transaction on block chain is a different use 
  case that putting a did on a blockchain
Niko: So that training partner for example the email track record 
  will implicitly already have the cryptographically verified 
  signatures and the timestamp signatures that prove that you 
  actually did this at the time now of course you can make the 
  argument we want to you know automate this and you want to like 
  have a more standardized flow around digital credentials or the 
  verifiable credentials for example.
Niko:  but I do think and I do think that that.
Niko: That's that's fine with like the technology for this is 
  already there at the time the technology that timestamp see 
  things and that you know makes things all of the bull way into 
  the past is already there has been there for 30 years.
PaulDietrich_GS1: I think the question for me is more like okay 
  I'm signing in to use this W3 system there are verifiable 
  credentials their revocation lists like what's the standard way 
  to do this do I mandate my trading partners go put these 
  timestamps and their messages because if I receive an email from 
  them with the timestamp all that proves is that I received it it 
  doesn't prove that I validated it and if I send an email back 
  that said oh I just want to send you an email to let you know 
  this really did validate that feels to me like weak evidence.
PaulDietrich_GS1:  because it doesn't really show that I did 
  validate it.
Niko: Right I think I think in that case it really mean like the 
  question is really what does validation mean in this context is 
  like a cryptographic validation.
PaulDietrich_GS1: Well it's very clear that I have to prove to a 
  regulator that I follow the rules at the time and if the rules 
  were the time to prove that that person was a registered licensee 
  of some trading characteristic then a cryptographic proof maybe 
  the right way to do it I could of course go back to paper 
  documents and phone calls and Records but I think that this 
  technology is trying to get us beyond that.
<tomj> this discussion is now off track completely
Niko: Right I so what I'm getting so okay so first of all there 
  is I'm very very happy with the verifiable credentials and the 
  PID and these sort of approach of like creating a better way of 
  creating a standardized way of asserting certain facts I think.
<phil_l_(p1)> We're mis-using "validation" -the issue is 
  verification (does something mathematically match). Nothing more.
Niko: Opinion as someone who has been involved the pgp and TBT 
  GPD ecosystem for a while it's a mess it's hard to use it's bad 
  the x.509 signing system is not exactly user-friendly either so I 
  do think the idea of creating you know a better standard for 
  signing off on facts is an absolutely great thing to have.
Niko: Like my my only angle here is like does this require 
  blockchain and if again like if the technology for time-stamping 
  a certain fact is already here doesn't need a blockchain system 
  so in your example like if you have the mechanism to demonstrate 
  that you ordered it some sort of you know regulatory requirements 
  then you can record that fact in say they verifiable credential.
Niko:  or like a is of some.
Niko: Mint and then you can have that timestamp by a Time Savings 
  over for example like this technology already exists like I don't 
  think the complexity overhead of doing a deal T adds anything of 
  value here stomach hurts.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Marcus.
Mike Prorock:  Filthy mind meeting.
Markus Sabadello:  I wanted to say just a few words about the 
  question of how do you prevent someone else from claiming the 
  same teeth with a different document so that is the job of the T 
  method to to ensure that right in most in most State methods you 
  cannot actually arbitrarily choose your teeth so you cannot just 
  claim any any string as a as it did but in.
Markus Sabadello:  Says that the.
Markus Sabadello:  Currently it's cryptographically your boy did 
  mess up to be unique for example one of the earliest block chain 
  based in methods which was PTC are in that case that it is not 
  for example a uuid that you can just claim and write the 
  blockchain but in that case the deed is actually an address on 
  the blockchain it's a pointer to a specific transaction on the 
  chain and that will only ever point to one.
Markus Sabadello:   Place on the on the blockchain.
Markus Sabadello:  You cannot associate another tip document and 
  claim that as yours with some other did methods like did key for 
  example that did itself is derived from from a public key right 
  so that the deed itself is your key so you cannot you cannot just 
  use a different date document and the claim that to be the 
  correct document.
Markus Sabadello:  This is what did methods are expected to 
  guarantee this is what did resolution process makes sure that you 
  actually get the corrected document for the deed and in the in 
  the tit specification we also use the term of a verifiable data 
  registry right so that there's the assumption that the identity 
  document is created and then resolved.
Markus Sabadello:   From some kind of.
Markus Sabadello:  Data layer or Data Network and so it simply 
  doesn't work like that where anyone can just clear claim and 
  identify and and then Associated the document you have to go 
  through the creation and resolution process defined by the did 
  method.
Niko: Right thanks thanks a lot so this kind of brings me maybe a 
  bit back to the what is the concrete like workflow and or use 
  case here that that argument damaged right because like.
Kristina: Yeah can I can I speak to that I'm next on the Queue 
  and I think we have four minutes left.
Kristina: Yeah so you know we can discuss multiple deployment 
  models multiple seems to be written on blockchain and I think 
  you're right side like I blockchain is not an absolute necessity 
  in realizing the assure holder there if our model that were if I 
  were credentials enable but it can be useful right and one place 
  it can be useful is writing the actual decentralized identifiers 
  on the chain and why because it mainly the idea.
Kristina: Of the user's individual users right.
Kristina: So I'm sure as you.
Kristina: Over 50 credentials when they are presented as verify 
  what presentations who's hold your binding they need the verifier 
  needs the holders keys to verify the signature on the 
  presentation and if it's a signature buys Erasure which is you 
  know usually a company and Enterprise to get the keys of zip 
  company you know you can use multiple existing mechanisms like 
  x.509 certs or you know dot all known gwas your I like.
Kristina:  like what not but how do you find the keys.
Kristina: The visual user seriously like if it's a user's you 
  know you we can't expect every single individual to host a domain 
  so we can put those well known and then attach hittable KS URI we 
  can expect to issue ex-wife or nice to a single individual on so 
  that's where you know can we have this public place and again we 
  can debate what kind of watching type is best suited but can we 
  have this public place where anyone can look at that.
Kristina:  identifier to psyche so be able to verify that.
Kristina: You're binding signature on the profile presentation 
  and to your point and the reason why I said it's not absolute 
  necessity because if you don't care about key rotation and you 
  don't care about finding any other information other than just 
  public keys because you can put not just probably keys but other 
  information other service and points to City ID document to like 
  if you don't care about that go ahead and pass a roll public key 
  in a verifiable credential so the very far just you know uses.
Kristina:  a troll public key to verify the signature on the 
  presentation.
Kristina: Is where the.
<markus_sabadello> See this old repo for a loooong list of 
  (mostly dead) "blockchain identity" projects: 
  https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity
Kristina: I'll chain piece would not be needed but if you want if 
  you want to be rotation if you want that you know the ID document 
  extensibility that the ID is will give you like it becomes an 
  option writing that users holders dids like on the Chain like 
  that's I think the minimum.
Niko: So I thought that that was that was a lot again as I said 
  in the beginning right like SS as I or giddy's is not exactly my 
  my big specialty I'm more in the blockchain world so I do want to 
  make one quick comment I think we're almost out of time but you 
  mentioned like can we have a public place to look up an 
  identifier to a key and the GDP our answer is no we cannot not if 
  you cannot have if you don't have.
Niko:  have the option to remove the identifiers to.
Greg Bernstein: Example: https://keys.openpgp.org/
Niko: Gene mapping from that ledger and that is kind of literally 
  the text and in GDP are yeah I think we're kind of out of time 
  but I'm happy to take more questions offline I think my email 
  address is putting them in it somewhere.
Harrison_Tang: No I haven't included that but Nico weekend follow 
  up after the meeting and then and then we can send over the 
  contact information to those who want to follow up.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah and honestly some of this discussion is 
  detailed enough you know just like cheer hat on and jumping in 
  since we're like out of time but like you know Nico if you don't 
  mind I mean having some of this discussion on the list could be 
  really helpful because there's a lot of interesting Nuance here 
  and this is part of what builds up this body of knowledge that 
  lets us actually go ask and answer these questions better in the 
  future and refine them and identify questions we didn't think 
  about asking and cetera so.
Niko: I'm happy to join discussions on the list are.
<keith_kowal> Thanks Niko!
Niko: Thanks for having me.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you thank you Nico and thanks everyone for 
  joining the this week's at w3c ccg meeting again nickel thanks a 
  lot for taking the time to present your findings and then thanks 
  everyone for a very interesting discussion thanks a lot bye.
Niko: Well again thank you very much.
Harrison_Tang: Oh no thank you thanks a lot no like as I 
  mentioned earlier there might be some good conversations from 
  this so thank you for taking the time you know to answer them in 
  a very methodical manner so thanks a lot.
Niko: Yeah I mean as I said before right I love being challenged 
  I'm obviously biased right I'm obviously coming from the kryptos 
  and blockchain skeptic universe and its really good stuff to have 
  these kind of conversations also in your own voice chat and not 
  just in a text format because it's really it.
Niko:  it's good Team Challenge.
Niko: I really enjoyed this and I'll have things to think about.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah definitely I think you know that's the main 
  goal I think to have great conversations and you know I really 
  appreciate you taking your time here because I kind of know this 
  my some conversations back and forth so I appreciate you coming 
  coming into the meeting thanks a lot.
Niko: Yeah it's been a pleasure I got to run into my next meeting 
  thank you so much have a good one.
Harrison_Tang: Cool and then I'll send you a follow-up email and 
  thank you and if you have anything to add or anything that you 
  want to take off lines and just let me know and I can make those 
  introductions and connections I haven't gone by.
