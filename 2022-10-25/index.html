<div class="information">&lt;kimberly_wilson_linson&gt; The mission of the W3C Credentials Community Group is to explore the creation, storage, presentation, verification, and user control of credentials. We focus on a verifiable credential (a set of claims) created by an issuer about a subject&#8212;a person, group, or thing&#8212;and seek solutions inclusive of approaches such as: self-sovereign identity; presentation of proofs by the bearer; data minimization; and centralized, federated, and decentralized registry and identity systems. Our tasks include drafting and incubating Internet specifications for further standardization and prototyping and testing reference implementations.</div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Kimberly Linson</span>:  Decentralized registry and identity systems are tasks include Drafting and incubating internet specifications for further standardization and prototyping and testing reference implementations so the the that Charter definitely I think gives a good sense of what we do here but it doesn&apos;t make any mention of dids or of the VC standard and that has. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Kimberly Linson</span>:  Create some real confusion in the community at large outside of ccg to the point where they&apos;re actually worsen folks start starting a community group to talk about dids and so we&apos;ve begun to just sort of wonder about whether or not we need to add something to our Charter about the work that we are doing in those areas and but before we really started drafting. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Kimberly Linson</span>:  Or adding to the Charter we wanted to just bring it to you all as a community and get your feedback and input about whether or not you think this change is even necessary so I just like to open it to the Florida to have questions and discussion around around that. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Kimberly Linson</span>:  Anybody feel strongly about not changing the the charter to include those things. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="information">TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Yeah I don&apos;t feel strongly about it but it does seem apparent that it&apos;s necessary given that there was another group already starting to try to have a conversation that we are already having. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="information">TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Not sure what shape that adjustment needs to be whether it actually needs to be a charter change or simply acknowledging the fact that we produced the original dids Etc or the pre working group document that went into the working group. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="information">TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Yeah so to try to be a little clearer because I&apos;m a little not awake today. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="information">TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Summarizing the work that has been done here and the work that is ongoing does not seem to me to require to change the charter it just needs to be documented so there might be an informative section of the charter as opposed to normative and we could do that I think pretty instantly. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Kimberly Linson</span>:  Thanks that that would be great. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="information">Harrison_Tang: Yeah I would just like to add that the church has to receive like I think one or two feedback in regards to the current Charter being a little bit for like Maritime confusing it is quite worthy and so so the feedback was if we could actually simplify and clarify it further so it&apos;s not a specific so yeah so I think adding VCS or he bids like those kind of. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="information">Harrison_Tang: Right because for example verifiable credentials is gaining quite a bit of more and more recognition so that we could help no kind of help clarify what we do here but I think more or less the main thing is about clean up the language to more for like baritone understand right for people who are not as familiar with this community. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Kimberly Linson</span>:  Yes this process of going through the the new proposed Charter would give us the opportunity to to to make edits to the whole thing so that&apos;s definitely it I thought too. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Kimberly Linson</span>:  So unless anyone is is strongly objecting my next ask is for anybody who&apos;s interested in sort of volunteering to to look at the language and provide some suggestions. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Kimberly Linson</span>:  And I you can raise your hand here if you want to or you can just reach out to me separately and we can talk about how we&apos;re going to going to move forward with looking at the language and Ted I would definitely appreciate your your historical wisdom on you know what what is non-normative that would be great so. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
