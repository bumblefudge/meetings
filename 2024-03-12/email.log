Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Hi everyone uh welcome to this week's w3c ccg 
  meeting uh today uh we are very excited to have my friend Andrew 
  Bud uh the founder and CEO of I proof 1 of the leading biometric 
  authentication uh service providers uh out there to actually 
  present about biometric authentication um you know authentication 
  as we know is kind of linkage between the physical digital 
  physical identity and the digital self and uh you know it is 1 of 
  the key uh Technologies uh in the identity stack so very very 
  glad uh to have him here uh but before we uh get to the main 
  agenda I just want to go over some uh quick quick uh.
Harrison_Tang: Call admin stuff.
Harrison_Tang: So first of all I just want to uh do a quick 
  reminder on the call of ethics and professional conduct I just 
  want to make sure that uh everyone uh be respectful and 
  acknowledge each other's different perspectives I think uh we 
  have been doing that quite well uh in the past years uh and I 
  just want to do a quick uh reminder for that.
Harrison_Tang: Another quick note on the intellectual property uh 
  anyone can participate in this calls however all substantive 
  contributions to the ccg work guidance must be members of the ccg 
  with 4 IP agreements signed so if you have questions in regards 
  to uh that or your w3c account feel free to uh pin any of the 
  cultures.
Harrison_Tang: A quick call note uh these meetings are being 
  automatically recorded and transcribed uh so we try to publish it 
  within the next 24 hours and uh uh actually uh the meeting 
  minutes and the video recordings are being automatically uh 
  published uh typically but uh the script has some issues so I'll 
  manually send it out uh in the next 24 to 48 hours.
Harrison_Tang: Uh we use ghee chat to cue the speakers during the 
  call as well as to take minutes uh so you can type in Q Plus to 
  add yourself to the queue and Q minus to remove uh and that will 
  moderate the queue.
Harrison_Tang: All right uh time for introductions and 
  reintroductions so if you're new to the community or you.
Harrison_Tang: Haven't been active and want to re-engage with the 
  community feel free to just unmute and.
Harrison_Tang: All right any uh any announcements or reminders.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah um uh the in the verifiable credentials 
  working group this week we are planning to take the BBS uh 
  cryptography Suite to the candidate recommendation phase that 
  basically means we are done with the design uh it's ready for 
  implementation we already have 2 independent implementations 
  which is the minimum required to.
Manu Sporny:   Get the.
<manu_sporny> BBS Cryptosuite CR spec: 
  https://w3c.github.io/vc-di-bbs/CR/2024-03-28/
Manu Sporny:  We want much more uh coverage eyes on it that sort 
  of thing so I'll put the uh BBS crypto Suite Crescent spec uh 
  that's in the chat channel so that's the static copy that's going 
  to go to candidate recommendation um we'll see if the vote 
  succeeds this week if it doesn't we'll keep trying until it does 
  um so just a heads up to implementers uh now would be the time to 
  start uh implementing uh if you haven't already we will have an 
  interoperability test Suite uh for you to use to demonstrate 
  interoperability with in the next uh couple of months um that's 
  it for the update.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you man thanks a lot.
Harrison_Tang: Great for next.
GregB: I just wanted to say on BBS um I've got example 
  implementations including all the way through an interoperability 
  server open source I will post that to uh.
GregB: The uh the mailing list and happy to help anybody who's 
  trying to get to implementations together or BBs.
GregB: I meant to.
Harrison_Tang: All right man.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah sorry and I realized that what I said might 
  have sounded like word salad to people that don't know what BBS 
  is BBS is an unlink.
Manu Sporny:  Digital signature Suite the reason that it is 
  important for individual privacy is because um.
Manu Sporny:  The way most digital signatures work if you show 
  something like a digital driver's license online the digital 
  signature on that is not going to change which means that it is a 
  tracking cookie wherever you use that driver's license online 
  every single website gets the same identifier and because of that 
  uh people can collude and track you as you go uh site to site as 
  you use that uh digital driver's license now if the digital 
  signature that's used uh is uses the BBS cryptography Suite the 
  signature changes for every single site that you use it on which 
  means that there is no longer at least in the signature a digital 
  tracking you know cookie token that can be used to correlate you 
  as you work across uh the the web so um if you need to do you 
  know things like prove age or things like that uh BBS is a is a 
  pretty good solution um because you can do it in a way where you 
  can't be tracked online so that's why people.
Manu Sporny:  Really interested in.
Manu Sporny:  The BBS crypto Suite that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Thanks for the amazing explanation.
Harrison_Tang: Wait uh we had a session on EBS before I think 
  about 67 months ago I think Greg actually met that discussion I 
  need anything new uh should we do an update on the PBS.
GregB: Uh yes uh there are some nice enhancements in security 
  privacy and usability that have gone into the spec and their new 
  features and the progress of the BBS crypto Suite so I'll work 
  with you offline to set up something.
Harrison_Tang: Great thank you thank thanks Greg I I actually 
  really appreciate um the your presentation last time especially 
  there was a demo that people can play with that helps uh us 
  understand how BBs works so thanks a lot.
Harrison_Tang: Any other announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: All right uh any updates on the work items.
Harrison_Tang: So we're still planning to have a session uh 
  around April uh to talk about the ccg for work items so if you 
  have any uh comments or new suggestions on how our guidance to be 
  added to the uh ccg uh feel free to reach out to any of the 
  cultures uh we will probably uh reach out to you A lot of people 
  in regards to the updates of existing Network items as well uh 
  actually will and I had a great call with Kim Duffy uh yesterday 
  in regards to uh the cgg work items so uh yep stay tuned I will 
  give the community an update uh in the next uh month or 2.
Harrison_Tang: All right any last calls for introductions 
  reintroductions announcements reminders or work items.
Harrison_Tang: All right so let's get to the main agenda.
Harrison_Tang: Then uh very excited to have Andrew but the 
  founder and CEO of I proof uh I proof is actually 1 of the 
  leading uh providers for biometric authentication and what's 
  called liveness detection so it's not just about Biometrics it's 
  also trying to determine whether the person on the other end is 
  alive or not um you know I actually met uh Andrew in the 
  conference about 2 months ago and uh I thought uh it's always 
  kind of good to have an expert to actually talk about this I know 
  biometric authentication has been uh a controversial top topic 
  especially in the kind of a privacy Arena so I think uh it's good 
  to have an expert here to kind of talk about and you know what's 
  true what are the facts and what are the myths uh because at the 
  end of the day you know you do need to uh establish the link 
  between the physical and digital self I mean personally I think 
  uh biometric authentication is 1 of the key Technologies to do 
  that so.
Harrison_Tang: Without further Ado um you know I'll let the 
  Andrew take the stage and if you have any questions uh please uh 
  add it to the queue and I will moderate the queue after the 
  presentation thanks a lot.
Harrison_Tang: Andrew the floor is yours.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Andrew this is a great presentation uh 
  actually even better than the 1 I saw about 2 2 years ago so 
  thank you uh any questions.
<rachel_donahue_(she/they)_-_digital_promise> WOW thank you!
Harrison_Tang: I'll be moderating the queue menu please.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah Andrew fantastic presentation um just 
  wonderful stuff um it it was eye-opening to see all the different 
  types of attacks that at least in my mind were a year or 2 out 
  and you're saying they're happening you know right now um and in 
  in I think you know the thing that many of us you know are 
  thinking about now is the irrational exuberance about what AI can 
  do um some of that's coming true faster than than most other 
  things do you feel like we're going to get to a point with 
  generative AI where even the the live you know uh detection um uh 
  uh uh uh things like you know the the changing of colors on 
  screens where we may not be able to depend on individuals devices 
  anymore to not inject you know generative AI feeds are we headed 
  towards the future where there has to be trusted Hardware out at 
  the edge uh what what do you think you know how do you think.
Manu Sporny:   This stuff's.
Manu Sporny:  Scales given that.
Harrison_Tang: So I have a follow-up question Andrew um when I uh 
  when you talked about inserting the predictable like element or 
  action like such as a control elimination uh the way I kind of 
  think of it is kind of like adding a cryptographic salt uh to 
  actually uh defend against the rainbow attacks okay so that 
  analogy is true okay so if so if that analogy is true then uh I'm 
  just curious like what do you foresee are the I guess the the 
  front for frosters to kind of counter count counter that uh that 
  approach because or is this problem like basically solved like 
  using basically this cryptographic so to to defend against is the 
  problem basically solved or do you foresee frosters coming up 
  with new scheme and what are those new schemes are.
Harrison_Tang: Great thank you well we'll take like 1 last 
  question uh Brandy.
Harrison_Tang: Brandy at you you're you're on mute.
Harrison_Tang: And by the way like I just want to add on uh 
  actually uh spoke you actually got a huge attack uh late last 
  year in regards to a car testing so it's a little bit different 
  like credit card testing and uh yeah like the volume at the 
  highest is like 100,000k like in that particular day so yeah this 
  is a real thing it's not the hypothetical scenario so yeah 
  unfortunately we were able to kind of detect it early and then 
  they went away but I think they probably just went to attack 
  other companies that that has a lesser security uh proof so yeah.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah cool thank you thanks Andrew this is a very 
  very great presentation and thanks for uh taking the time uh to 
  uh present here at w3c and uh if anybody missed this great 
  presentation will uh publish the recording uh later uh this week 
  so thanks a lot.
Harrison_Tang: Great all right this concludes uh this week's cgg 
  meeting so thanks everyone Thanks for attending.
