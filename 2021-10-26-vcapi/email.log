Mike Varley is scribing.
Manu Sporny:  Agenda review, introductions, community updates, 
  call focus on work Joe and Eric have been doing on VC API 
  ecosystem
  ... diagrams, naming, dataflows,
  ... a PR is in for this content, this is background to future 
  discussions.

Topic: Introductions

<vasilis_k> Hello, my name is Vasileis, I'm currently an MSC 
  student at AUEB studying computer science. I'm interested in the 
  domain of VC and SSI. Today I wanted to attend the meeting in 
  order to find out more. Nice to meet you all.

Topic: Relevant Community Updates

Manu Sporny:  The Verifiable Creentials TPAC meetings are this 
  week... if you are a w3c member and missed it there was charter 
  discussion
<mprorock> CCG t pac overlapped unfortunately along with WebML
Brent Zundel: https://w3c.github.io/vc-wg-charter/
<kerri_lemoie> Can give brief update-VC-EDU Task Force Charter 
  Updated: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAdC1mBSP-p6zxXGRQNfSQNPe5MY6UZ6Tf676oY7BOk/edit#heading=h.iem8mwq6o4rn
<manu> VCWG charter -- https://w3c.github.io/vc-wg-charter/
  ... please read/review/comment for today or tomorrow for review 
  so it can be locked down.
  ... no VC API in the charter, but it could be added as a "note" 
  if significant progress is made.
  ... lots of work to be done and to be seen how fast consensus 
  can be gained on the VC API spec to see if it can be made a note.
  ...
  ... conversation tomorrow will be on VC 1.1 and VC 2.0 spec 
  before maintenance charter expires.
<mprorock> yep - manu answered my questions
Kerri Lemoie:  Verifiable education Tasklist charter added in 
  chat
  ... include training and achievement creds
  ... question to the Edu group was how to include all the data 
  standards for various types, consolidated now to focus on VC 
  format.
  ...
  ... meeting Monday to continue EDU discussion
Mike Prorock: +1 A few creds would be awesome
Manu Sporny:  How can this group help? we have VC API - can EDU 
  group provide a credential to demonstrate interop over? something 
  more important?
Kerri Lemoie:  Discussions around how API and unversal wallet can 
  work... still discussing how this work can help.
DmitryZ: VC API and recharted VC group are of interest to EDU 
  group but still early to engage.
Manu Sporny:  Over to Joe for next section; diagram overview and 
  flow diagram... other format?

Topic: VC API Components

Joe Andrieu:  3 Things to cover: introduce High Level 
  Architecture, go over supply chain flow which is a concrete use 
  case, then go over learnings.
Joe Andrieu: https://legreq.github.io/vc-api/
Joe Andrieu:  Can also cover the CHAPI version if there is time.
Joe Andrieu:  (Attaching materials)
Joe Andrieu:  PR replaces architecture overview entirely...
  ... defines issuer/verifier/holder and then described 
  components, to clarify what is an "App" and what is a "service"
  ... there are components/services that execute business rules 
  on behalf of the actor
  ... For example there is an Issuer web application that drives 
  the VC API Issuer service.
  ... storage services are included, question on this needs to be 
  standardized (like an EDV) or just leave it as "internal DB".
  ... There are Holder applications backed by a service, but the 
  User Agent (browser) may still reach out to an EDV without 
  contacting their service layer (needs to be accounted for)
  ... some services may communicate directly with other services 
  without an app layer.
<mprorock> likely out of scope
  ... There needs to be an 'Admin' interface for services, not 
  considered here currently.
<mprorock> at least for now
  ... (does admin interfacee need standardization? we have enough 
  to do)
<david_chadwick> I cannot see the diagrams in my browsers
<mprorock> i had to go to the PR to go see the diagrams
<mprorock> not visible in link for me
Joe Andrieu:  I think what most folks call wallets today is a 
  combination of the "app" and "servoce"
<by_caballero>	files changes --> ... menu --> view file
Joe Andrieu: https://legreq.github.io/vc-api/
<joe_andrieu> Does that work for you?
David Chadwick:  (Diagrams are not viewable, is there a format 
  problem?)
<justin_richer> same no embedded images here either
Mike Prorock:  Yes, there is an issue with viewing the image...
<by_caballero> github propagation glitches
<justin_richer> I'm getting a 404 on the image itself: 
  https://legreq.github.io/vc-api/diagrams/vc-http-api-architecture.svg
Mike Prorock: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api/pull/237/files#diff-f1e062c2314e98b0df6a8cf0918a955b5fcbb22ae0e86b2918ddd9e1a8d3f15e
<mprorock> and the BIG diagram 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api/blob/bedac5601dfccdc89aea05ff06a688478499c6c8/diagrams/roles.png
Adrian: when it comes to authorization, is this a function of the 
  App or the Service?
<justin_richer> AS would be a function of whatever service is 
  being protected
<mprorock> anywhere there is a connection / api call there should 
  be auth of some kind
Joe Andrieu:  All the arrows in the digram need some conversation 
  on how the connections are secured...
Mike Prorock: +1 On storing VPs
David Chadwick:  In our implementation the VP can also be stored 
  (diagram only shows VCs being stored) - for verifiers audit 
  trail.
Joe Andrieu:  Switching to sequence diagram
  ... This flow begins at the "Holder App"; the Holder actor is 
  no longer involved, the have passed control to the App.
<mprorock> more event triggered, but sure
  ... the service is like a cron-job that can call the holder app 
  for its business process
<mprorock> one or more VCs btw
Manu Sporny: +1
  ... holder app executes business logic and calls the "holder 
  service" to build the VP
  ... Holder app calls back to Verifier App with the VP, and 
  verifier App calls the Verifier Service for verification.
  ... Verifier App then stores VP (as required) and then Holder 
  App is informed that VP was accepted.
  ... this is a supply-chain view on the flows, where the 
  holder/actor is not really involved like a CHAPI flow
<joe_andrieu> Please try again https://legreq.github.io/vc-api/
Manu Sporny:  Steps 3,4,5,6: makes it seem there are 2 ways to 
  execute this flow (push and pull) - now it seems like just a pull 
  flow
  ... "notify data ready" may be confusing terminology
Mike Prorock: +1 Manu - you got it
  ... when really its a "domain/challenge" etc challenge for the 
  desired Presentation
  ... if that is accurate then this is aligned with CHAPI flow.
<mprorock> yes
Joe Andrieu:  In supply chain flow, the Holder defines that data 
  that is "ready" - as opposed to personal flow, the Holder wants 
  to use a service, and the Verifier asks for credentials it wants.
  ... (personal == CHAPI)
Mike Prorock:  Some notes on current impl - whenever a system is 
  called there are various levels of Authorization being executed 
  at various points.
  ... "I have data ready" is an initiation flow that defines the 
  data / credential that is ready for submission that gets run 
  through a business app flow/Queue.
  ... eg a shipping manifest, or multiple manifests that are used 
  in the business process.
  ... services/apps have very extensive audit trails; the audit 
  trail API is out of scope from the spec but still very important 
  for the use case.
<by_caballero> no idea
Joe Andrieu: +1 That #6 should still specify the data type 
  request
David Chadwick:  Need some clarifiaction on the difference 
  between supply chain "here is a presentation that is ready" vs. 
  other flow where verifier is asking for specifics.
<mprorock> btw - this is kindof the simple flow that lets us 
  operate to start, there is the scaling big side of this that may 
  go well beyond this (e.g. pub/sub, async fire and forget, 
  streaming data between parties, etc)
Joe Andrieu:  Is the question "sometimes you don't know the type 
  of credential the verifier will accept" and (6) may be the right 
  place for that negotiation...
<by_caballero> presentation exchange?
Mike Prorock:  Mostly there are pre-configured rules in place for 
  various processes, so "negotiation" is likely already defined as 
  a configured workflow that both sides understand.
Mike Prorock:  From a scaling perspective, sometimes there are 
  20,000 presentations "ready", which is where pre-configuratino is 
  important.
  ... with large scale / high volume system, sometimes even 
  REST/HTTP gets tested and becomes more of a 'stream' of data
David Chadwick:  Maybe this is a published meta-data type 
  solution
Adrian: I see calls to "an open endpoint" kicking off the flow... 
  can we identify that call?
<mprorock> none of our endpoints are open
  ... by open it means unprotected and subject to spam/dos 
  attacks. Like in OAuth, the initial OAuth request is an "open 
  endppint"
<manu_sporny> We (Digital Bazaar) does have open endpoints, fwiw
<manu_sporny> like, CHAPI starts off w/ an open endpoint.. #3 is 
  open.
Joe Andrieu:  None of these endpoints are meant to be open - but 
  there needs to be a conversation on each of these points on how 
  they are secured.
Mike Prorock:  Impl. has no open endpoints, clients are connected 
  after contracts are signed.
Kerri Lemoie:  Can a Verifier return a VC?
<mprorock> 19 is an ACK and yes, could be a return of more data
<mprorock> such as errors, warnings, or trigger another flow
<by_caballero> ^  (In your system?)
Mike Prorock: +1 Juan
<by_caballero> (or in general?)
Joe Andrieu:  Yes, the Verifier could provide a VC / consent 
  receipt as part of (19).
<by_caballero> (sweet just being explicit for the notes)
Kerri Lemoie:  In terms of EDU use case, these are like 
  "endorsement flows" where a Verified 'endorses' a credenital.
<mprorock> that's what cloudflare is fore
<mprorock> *for
Manu Sporny:  For some use cases, there will be open endpoints 
  (like a process to kick off authorization). In some cases there 
  needs to be considerations for some open endpoints.
  ... to Kerri's point; it could be a simple ACK (200 OK) or it 
  could be a use case that is a continuation: like a "you have 
  passed step one, let's continue to step 2".
  ... for example, present driver's license, then present other 
  qualification form and so on.
  ... in (19) there could be a loop step (3) for some new 
  credential types.
<eric_schuh> Also could loop into the issuance flow (not shown 
  here)
Kerri Lemoie: +1 Manu - that's great
Mike Prorock: +1 Manu - there is definite use for that
Ted Thibodeau:  (20) Should be closer to (13) - because something 
  was sent (ACK even before it is processed)
  ... question about meaning of solid/dashed lines, and what is a 
  response and what is a call out.
<mprorock> Ted - we are logging all inbound / outbound / etc but 
  i am not sure that is in scope outside of non-normative best 
  practices for security and audit controls
Joe Andrieu:  This flow has "normal English" to convey 
  intent/logic/semantics, but then in later versions we can insert 
  actual API endpoints and params.
Manu Sporny:  Hopefully this was a great help to the group (this 
  vas very valuable as concrete material)
  ... there is a PR for this content, please review. Maybe next 
  call cover CHAPI flow?
Joe Andrieu:  Yes, let's look at CHAPI flow, but this diagram 
  also has some controversial statements that need to be discussed; 
  was something misunderstood or incorrect?
<mprorock> as long as we don't drop years in names, cool
  ... there are also places where we are "not" specifying 
  standardization; like key management. Sso how to navigate thosee 
  issues needs discussion
<kerri_lemoie> This is great. Thank you!
