[2020-02-10T16:22:52.281Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd: start with emerging standards, today some from credentials community group
[2020-02-10T16:22:58.236Z]	<kimhd>	https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1izgO1ln5MgYOLlSCpTiWAvFXHEtidZudpD2C-ztCMx4/edit?usp=sharing

[2020-02-10T16:26:15.043Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd: start with slide 3
[2020-02-10T16:26:24.322Z]	<chriswinc>	present+
[2020-02-10T16:26:51.022Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd: DID:  uri from which DID doc can be retrieved
[2020-02-10T16:27:50.015Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd: explaining DID identifier and what it looks like
[2020-02-10T16:28:22.107Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd: DID string can be resolved to verify key ownership
[2020-02-10T16:29:07.083Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd: like issuer id in openbadges, or email for subject
[2020-02-10T16:29:21.293Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd:  OpenBadges 2.1 will support DIDs
[2020-02-10T16:29:33.551Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd: go to slide 4
[2020-02-10T16:30:19.646Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd: did:web uses domain name for verification
[2020-02-10T16:30:38.303Z]	<kimhd>	did:web slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wWI2qeQfgOgFdDp5Adt9hwHxVTt-ctG9naBEpNjOSTo
[2020-02-10T16:31:07.843Z]	<jameschartrand>	dimitriz: author of did:web
[2020-02-10T16:31:42.813Z]	<jameschartrand>	dimitriz: motivation for did:method, context, where it fits in, challenges
[2020-02-10T16:32:09.426Z]	<jameschartrand>	dimitiz: DIDs uniquely identify issuer and the entity being issued to
[2020-02-10T16:32:25.897Z]	<kimhd>	slide 4 is super helpful
[2020-02-10T16:32:29.967Z]	<jameschartrand>	dimitriz: helps disambiguate
[2020-02-10T16:32:49.146Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: did can be reused
[2020-02-10T16:32:56.545Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: go to slide 5
[2020-02-10T16:33:06.048Z]	<kimhd>	James: during the slides, feel free to be very brief in scribing. The slide link is part of the minutes
[2020-02-10T16:33:55.126Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: govs don't want to be responsible for managing identities
[2020-02-10T16:34:41.265Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: explains slide 6
[2020-02-10T16:35:18.981Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: identifiers should be reusable across contexts
[2020-02-10T16:35:43.009Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: identifiers should provide info about entity
[2020-02-10T16:36:37.013Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: skip to slide 16
[2020-02-10T16:37:09.627Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: some dids are ephemeral
[2020-02-10T16:37:30.093Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: explains different implementations of dids
[2020-02-10T16:38:18.582Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: blockchain based: coin based, non-coin based, ledgers internal like hyperledger
[2020-02-10T16:38:40.042Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: jump to slide 19
[2020-02-10T16:38:59.931Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: key management and building wallets is hard
[2020-02-10T16:39:15.928Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: same problems with all dids, how to manage private keys
[2020-02-10T16:41:31.944Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: problem with DIDs, how do we know issuer key belongs to issuer
[2020-02-10T16:42:03.882Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: go to slide 20
[2020-02-10T16:42:35.168Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: trying to solve problem of trust anchors
[2020-02-10T16:43:05.992Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: so why not reuse infrastructure around domain names
[2020-02-10T16:43:57.782Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: slide 21
[2020-02-10T16:44:34.098Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: stick did:web in front of url and you get a did
[2020-02-10T16:44:46.922Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: did document you get back is same as any other
[2020-02-10T16:45:36.330Z]	<chriswinc>	q+
[2020-02-10T16:45:37.389Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: explains how to bind did to domain
[2020-02-10T16:45:49.317Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: slide 23 - benefits of did:web
[2020-02-10T16:46:00.728Z]	<durgaprasad814>	q+
[2020-02-10T16:46:58.130Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: did:web provides bridge step until dids solidify
[2020-02-10T16:47:51.372Z]	<kimhd>	q+
[2020-02-10T16:48:21.048Z]	<tzviya>	q+ to ask about reputation and credibility
[2020-02-10T16:48:24.285Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: how do we protect integrity - blockchain provides some
[2020-02-10T16:48:43.528Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: how do we make sure document doesn't change
[2020-02-10T16:49:00.070Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz:hashlinks can lock down contents of did document so it can't be changed
[2020-02-10T16:49:33.724Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz:hashlinks also allows specifying backup links
[2020-02-10T16:51:22.142Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: certificate authorities can get hijacked - ca transparency can help - fairly robust
[2020-02-10T16:51:32.231Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: ledger solutions will look like ca transparency
[2020-02-10T16:51:38.677Z]	<kimhd>	some certificate transparency references: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency
[2020-02-10T16:51:49.149Z]	<kimhd>	https://www.certificate-transparency.org/
[2020-02-10T16:52:53.790Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: did:web with hashlinks - how to add key, revoke or rotate - breaks hashlink - confident of solution because precedents like keybase
[2020-02-10T16:53:12.750Z]	<juancaballero>	keybase.io
[2020-02-10T16:53:45.317Z]	<juancaballero>	ipfs and ipld
[2020-02-10T16:53:46.141Z]	<juancaballero>	KERI
[2020-02-10T16:53:52.286Z]	<juancaballero>	you mean?
[2020-02-10T16:54:00.361Z]	<kimhd>	KERI yes
[2020-02-10T16:54:09.634Z]	<juancaballero>	or the SCIDs piece?
[2020-02-10T16:54:23.622Z]	<juancaballero>	(two different way of certifying through rotation :D)
[2020-02-10T16:54:45.492Z]	<juancaballero>	(both by sam smith - hard day to be the scribe!)
[2020-02-10T16:54:46.364Z]	<kimhd>	good point. Here's a link to KERI info: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/KERI-Universal-DKMI.md
[2020-02-10T16:55:16.487Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: did working group is working on ability to reuse service enpoints to chain dids
[2020-02-10T16:55:54.026Z]	<jameschartrand>	kimhd: push credential issuer discussion to next week
[2020-02-10T16:55:57.074Z]	<kimhd>	ack chriswinc
[2020-02-10T16:56:03.146Z]	<tzviya>	q?
[2020-02-10T16:56:37.062Z]	<jameschartrand>	chriswinc: slide 21,22 - is key material separate from domain structure?
[2020-02-10T16:57:03.623Z]	<kimhd>	Scribe: jameschartrand
[2020-02-10T16:57:13.831Z]	<jameschartrand>	dmitriz: could reuse public key in ca, but don't have to

[2020-02-10T16:59:48.463Z]	<jameschartrand>	durgaprasad814: explains how text field of dns record is used
[2020-02-10T17:00:23.548Z]	<jameschartrand>	durgaprasad814: how do we deal with lesser known domains?
[2020-02-10T17:00:44.843Z]	<tzviya>	q+
[2020-02-10T17:00:52.282Z]	<jameschartrand>	dimitriz:  answer: partner with better known institution
[2020-02-10T17:01:09.853Z]	<kimhd>	ack KerriLemoie
[2020-02-10T17:01:27.977Z]	<jameschartrand>	KerriLemoie:  what happens if domain changes hands
[2020-02-10T17:02:05.222Z]	<juancaballero>	or if all .org TLD management changes hands :_(
[2020-02-10T17:02:33.353Z]	<jameschartrand>	dimitriz: hashlinks prevent changes to past dids with hashlinks
[2020-02-10T17:03:04.281Z]	<jameschartrand>	dimitriz:  but is a problem in general - cert transparency may help
