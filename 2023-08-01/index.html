<div onmouseout="$('#link-202').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-202').show()" id="202" class="comment"><span class="name">Joel Hartshorn</span>:  From your perspective with you see like yes I&apos;m three but you have a bunch of things are signed with the object capability that was expired a kind to so I&apos;m not going to accept them as well however you have a proof that this was time-stamped before that you can accept those. <a id="link-202" style="display:none;" href="#202">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-204').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-204').show()" id="204" class="comment"><span class="name">Alan Karp</span>:  But it resolves the problem you mentioned distributed resources and needing to get the revocation signal to them you could just rely on the timeouts. <a id="link-204" style="display:none;" href="#204">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-205').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-205').show()" id="205" class="comment"><span class="name">Joel Hartshorn</span>:  Yeah I mean unless you have an expiration time this like too far into the future and you actually want to revoke a key. <a id="link-205" style="display:none;" href="#205">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-206').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-206').show()" id="206" class="comment"><span class="name">Alan Karp</span>:  Well that again that&apos;s why I don&apos;t like just I don&apos;t like using expiration times but certainly a good fallback and if you have a distributed system sometimes it&apos;s just the simplest thing the hard part actually of the expiration time is you didn&apos;t want to revoke so you have to reissue the capability that&apos;s typically the trickiest part. <a id="link-206" style="display:none;" href="#206">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-207').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-207').show()" id="207" class="comment"><span class="name">Joel Hartshorn</span>:  Yeah and as far as actually that&apos;s very simple because if you come to an application the application notice is that the session key has a capability that&apos;s been expired it&apos;s trivial to generate a new one a snoozer designing new message. <a id="link-207" style="display:none;" href="#207">✪</a></div>
