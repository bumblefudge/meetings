  ... DIF will be holding the secure data storage WG
  ... our first scoping call will be centered around an update
  ... will be creating the scope around the WG for the call

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Questions?

Topic: ZKP (Cred) Primer with Daniel Hardman

Kim Hamilton Duffy: http://j.mp/37ZIy5B
  ... next is the ZKP Primer by Daniel Hardman
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Over to Daniel Hardman
Joe Andrieu:  Earlier Daniel you established the idea of 
  approximately zero...
  ... isn't the signature approximately 0
Daniel Hardman:  No it is not 0
Dave Longley:  The term approximately plays a role when the 
  signature value and a super unique name carries the same 
  weight...
Daniel Hardman:  Slide 24 addresses that a little bit. We can 
  talk about it more when we get there.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12i_dBRCC864WcipEywz_WFSqvxPUKTA_KBqWzW-Hq2c/edit#slide=id.g6fffce0de9_0_109
Dave Longley:  My other question is ZKP Proof vs. ZKP 
  Arguments...
  ... ZK Snarks are different than ZK Proofs
  ... ZK Proofs gives you computational zero knowledge
  ... if someone has enough computational power then it can be 
  broken
  ... are these not computational bound
Daniel Hardman:  The distinction that you are making is about the 
  formal definition...
  ... when someone wags their finger they are usually living in 
  formal definition land
  ... the short answer is ZK Snarks and other things like it is 
  what ZKP creds include
  ... I am talking about ZKPs in the informal sense as long as 
  they meet the canonical definition
  ... back to slide 14.
Dave Longley: Seems "it's not a ZKP" is a matter of perspective 
  and that's important to note
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you this is a great overview...
  ... we maybe will be able to have you on for a follow up 
  discussion.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you everyone!
