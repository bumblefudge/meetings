<kerri_lemoie> Hello all
<julie_keane> Hey!
<adam_eunson_(tangle_labs)> :wave:
<adam_eunson_(tangle_labs)> Hello from sunny Switzerland :D
<maarten_boender> Present
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
<doug_belshaw> Serge and I were in the Google Meet, lol
Kerri Lemoie:  Hello everybody Welcome to the Monday July 10th 
  verify the credentials for Education task force call my name is 
  Perry lavoie transcriber might call me Cary Illinois but really 
  I'm sorry look like today our main topic is open recognition we 
  have a Julie Smith and a out here to present when you kick off a 
  discussion about open recognition and verifiable steps.
Kerri Lemoie:   So let me get a few things.

Topic: IP Note

Kerri Lemoie:  And then we will get going first thing is to know 
  that anybody can participate in these calls these are open calls 
  but if you intend to do any work on any credential community 
  group spec then you should join the clinical community group and 
  inside me I pr agreement that information is in the agenda link 
  that I put in the chat follow that their reach out to me if you 
  are serious about becoming a signed up man.
Kerri Lemoie:   Our of the TCG.

Topic: Call Notes

Kerri Lemoie:  Also note that these calls are recorded and there 
  are minutes and everything is to add a public page and it was 
  archives there you can see it later with the calls are over we 
  typically send out an email within a day or so with the published 
  minute also note that we use accused festivities called so we 
  really encourage discussion we want to make sure that everybody 
  has a chance.
Kerri Lemoie:   So if you are you look at the question of.

Topic: Introductions & Reintroductions

Kerri Lemoie:  And the conversation piece of paper to press like 
  I just did in the chat and then you can also take a few - you 
  take yourself out of the few okay and before I would get going 
  couple other things one is I'm introductions and re-inspection is 
  there anybody that's new to the call today that would like to 
  introduce themselves if so you can see yourself up in the chat 
  and this includes anybody who would also like to reproduce 
  themselves oh and one other thing.
Kerri Lemoie:   In addition to typing to you or a few- you.
Kerri Lemoie:  The other hand.
Kerri Lemoie:  At the level of navigation I see that you have to 
  give yourself up.
Eric: Yep hi everybody so I'm new to the school I'm a pretty girl 
  John Q working on the solution called pockets for Arizona State 
  University and yeah I guess that's it I'm the engineering manager 
  for the team that's pretty much it.
<adam_eunson_(tangle_labs)> I'd like to say hi.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you I think 20 teaching yourself.
Kerri Lemoie:  Adam I think you there cat how are you.
Adam_Eunson_(Tangle_Labs): Thank you very much I'm great thank 
  you I'm Adam I'm just one of the founders from Tango Labs which 
  is a German company that we're currently working on interoperable 
  Solutions in self Sovereign identity I had the pleasure of 
  meeting Dimitri actually in dice in Zurich not long ago and he 
  invited me to participate because our Focus currently is with 
  UNESCO learning institute's and cities in the EU working towards 
  an interoperable loner identity ecosystem.
Adam_Eunson_(Tangle_Labs):  whatever one of those will end up 
  peeing.
Adam_Eunson_(Tangle_Labs): One of our focus is actually working 
  towards a sort of Universal open source badge data model 
  specification so that's something that that's kind of in the 
  pipeline's is purely based on D ID and verifiable credentials so 
  it's great to be here thank you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  From Adam really glad to have you here.
Manu Sporny: +1 Welcome Adam! :)
Adam_Eunson_(Tangle_Labs): Hey how you doing awesome how is di 
  web sorry I'm digressing.
Adam_Eunson_(Tangle_Labs): Yeah I'd love to at some point.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thanks for joining us Adam and I love to hear more 
  about what you working on maybe you can present on some call 
  great thank you.
Adam_Eunson_(Tangle_Labs): My wife's off work so if I do work 
  next week I get killed.
<julie_keane> staying married is important
Manu Sporny: +1
<adam_eunson_(tangle_labs)> Hell yeah
<adam_eunson_(tangle_labs)> :D
Kerri Lemoie:  Let you out figure that out we can figure that out 
  okay don't see any other introductions or reintroductions it 
  makes you have to be paying married is important and I was 
  wondering if anybody has an announcement or reminders that they 
  would like to share if so why don't you go ahead and kill 
  yourself up and let us know - hi.
Manu Sporny: Request: Demonstration of Support for Selective 
  Disclosure for Data Integrity -- 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2023Jun/0164.html
Manu Sporny:  Hey thanks Gary one quick and we are trying to 
  close up the demonstrations of support for Selective disclosure 
  for data Integrity so there was an email that was sent out to the 
  verifiable sorry credentials community group about showing 
  support for Selective disclosure for data Integrity of put that 
  email in the.
Manu Sporny:   Chat Channel.
<manu_sporny> Selective Disclosure for W3C Data Integrity 
  --https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d-04kIWhPuNscsAyUuRH3pduqrNerhigCWahKe6SNos/edit#
Manu Sporny:  For those of you that hadn't heard about it this is 
  basically a way of selectively disclosing something in a 
  verifiable credential so think if a student has a student ID and 
  it's got a lot of their information in it as a verifiable 
  credential this selective disclosure mechanism would allow them 
  to just disclose like the university that they attend without 
  losing any of the other information last name first.
Manu Sporny:   First name.
Manu Sporny:  Or so without disclosing their personally 
  identifiable information we are getting ready to raise a set of 
  pull requests in the verifiable credential working group and we 
  would like to make sure that we've got support from this 
  community before we do that there is a sign-up sheet so there's a 
  presentation that I linked to in the chat Channel selected 
  disclosure for w3c data Integrity in.
Manu Sporny:   And there is a.
<manu_sporny> Demonstration of Support for NIST-Compliant 
  Selective Disclosure for Data Integrity Cryptosuites in VCWG -- 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzYfqkgCQfsXEkqLegy2v7Dhtf0sQQYrT2JAGbnaMjE/edit
Manu Sporny:  That we would like folks to add their names to if 
  they have selective disclosure use cases and they want to see 
  this thing exists as a global standard there's a sheet for that 
  here so I'll not in here in the chat Channel that's there so if 
  you you know have a use case or need for doing selective 
  disclosure.
Manu Sporny:   With verifiable credentials.
Manu Sporny:  I would appreciate you putting your name down on 
  that sheet so that we can demonstrate that there's interest so 
  that we can push that forward on the global standard stage that's 
  it thanks.
Kerri Lemoie:  That's awesome thank you money Korea you and next 
  to meet you.
<julie_keane> When will the bot transcribe baby talk.  It would 
  be amazing
Kerri Lemoie: https://internetidentityworkshop.com/
Kaliya Young:  Share that the internet and workshop number I 
  think it's 37 is coming up in October pretty early and I'm skirt 
  10 to 12 um so just letting folks know about it and I'll say that 
  but it took us abilities if you want to be then we'll do here.
<kaliya_identitywoman> Thanks
Kerri Lemoie:  You're breaking up a little bit but I put the link 
  to the iwi and the cat for folks to sign up for those of you who 
  are interested in plus side we are planning on holding of the day 
  before like we did last last look I've Monday October 9th I'm in 
  the same location.
Kerri Lemoie:  I have a floor.
<kerri_lemoie> Great!
Nate_Otto_(he/him): Okay thanks Carrie surges also here we have 
  an exciting announcement for this morning which is that our beta 
  sign up has opened today for Orca the open recognition Community 
  app this is intended to be open source but we're planning for an 
  open source release around December this year with some early 
  partner access new open badges 3.0 verifiable credentials 
  platform also supporting open badge.
Nate_Otto_(he/him):  has 2.0 the focus is on.
Nate_Otto_(he/him): Practice who want to do bad weather including 
  the badges at the same time that they're producing them reducing 
  the distance between when that credential is awarded and when 
  it's when it's consumed as much as possible so new beta signups 
  are open today it's a waitlist and so we will gradually invite 
  new communities in as we have capacity for them and in addition 
  that little bit of a user's group where people can discuss and 
  talk about how to use.
Nate_Otto_(he/him):  badges for open recognition so I'll put a 
  sign up link in.
https://social.orcabadges.org/user/registration/by-link?token=rZLZtDPbs3cpa2&spaceId=2
Nate_Otto_(he/him): And stay tuned also for announcements on 
  LinkedIn and all the socials today.

Topic: Main Topic - Open Recognition with Julie Keane from Participate.com & Don Presant from factory.cancred.ca

Kerri Lemoie:  Asking me that's really great good good timing 
  here because it's called okay it looks like the queue is empty so 
  why do we go ahead and move to the next topic which is about open 
  recognition so I would like to introduce Julie Keen from 
  participate.com to kick us off and on will have some slides for 
  us and we just discussion do it also.
Julie_Keane: Yeah all right well we've been teed up very well by 
  Adam and also Nate and there's lots of open recognition folks 
  here Serge and made and Simona and Carrie and Cheryl and Doug and 
  Anna so lots of folks have been working in this space so Don and 
  I are really just representing we have a couple of groups that 
  will lots of community calls that go on monthly so we'll talk 
  about that at the end but I'm just going to not waste any time.
Julie_Keane:  time and let's dive into open recognition.
Julie_Keane: Don take it away.
Don_Presant: Great thanks Julie can everybody hear me okay.
Don_Presant: Great so yeah don't Present part of the open 
  recognition workgroup we're one of the active communities of 
  practice connected with the open skills Network I see in the list 
  of participants on supported today by several co-conspirators and 
  I'm sure I'll be reaching out to several of them that said this 
  is a fairly technical group were speaking to you today this is a 
  fairly non-technical talk we're just basically talking about 
  principles and values that we think.
Don_Presant:  are important and should be thought about When 
  developing these.
Kerri Lemoie: +1 To principles & values related to this tech
Don_Presant: So I thought I'd start somewhat controversially to 
  say you know my credentials and other verifiable credentials 
  feeding it to skills based hiring sounds pretty good until you 
  start to think about it a bit I like to call this Frank and skill 
  Stein or maybe that's team for employers where the ideas that 
  they can simply specify some kind of a unicorn and lo and behold 
  there it is sort of assembled on the fly as it were and there 
  seems to be a under.
Don_Presant:  lying in some.
Don_Presant: Part of many that were just the sum of our skills 
  and we in our community think that people are more than that I 
  found this report from last September pretty useful but it really 
  it's still thinking about that idea of the hungry mouths the idea 
  that it's just about skills it's just about hiring key 
  stakeholders being employers institutions and government and 
  really there's no.
Don_Presant:  there's no learner voice.
Don_Presant: In this document and in a lot of the discussions and 
  also this notion about communities that Nate which is talking 
  about and hope we get a chance to explore more in the 
  question-and-answer later on a lot of this began before micro 
  credentials it began with a very expansive notion of connected 
  learning in other words learning that's connected to things that 
  you care about starting with your passions and seeing where they 
  take.
Don_Presant:  you a more can I say.
Don_Presant: Laura Tori Journey based kind of a vision and notice 
  though none left that there's online learning but there's also 
  things like volunteer programs that could also be things like 
  makerspaces and out-of-school activities Kerry has some great 
  experience with that with a cheery so and then then you notice on 
  the right job opportunities it's only one of the doors that can 
  open to you so the vision wasn't only about life long learning it 
  was about life wide learning very much rooted in the community 
  and I'm sure some people.
Don_Presant:  remember she called the city of learning Pittsburgh 
  city of learning at the Sprout found at cetera.
Don_Presant: It a lot.
Don_Presant: Colleges and universities universities didn't really 
  know what to do with this concept it was meant Wild West they're 
  worried about who was issuing the badges whether too many were 
  being issued lack of assessment lack of quality standards but I 
  think a lot of people also saw an opportunity to break some of 
  the big degrees or macro credentials down into modular stackable 
  chunks in there was a sort of parallel notion of stacking of 
  programs that ended up being conflated with it so we started to 
  hear.
Don_Presant:  during about the term micro credential Run 2014 
  2015 defined by you.
Don_Presant: Going many others.
Don_Presant: It really comes down to a lot of course certificates 
  fairly institution Centric very much with a fairly top-down 
  framing of recognition which we feel has a tendency to pull the 
  original Vision out of shape.
Don_Presant: So recognition I think is key word and it's got a 
  wide scope outside of formal recognition the professions hiring 
  practices because there's a notion of self recognition and even 
  self-assertion and that can be self-actualization but it can also 
  progress to you making a claim about yourself that's verifiable 
  perhaps you think you might do in a resume or cover letter in a 
  verifiable way that can be a supported by others then there's 
  social recognition the kind you get among peers and then.
Don_Presant:  these may be built around geography may be around 
  practices interests Etc and that's kind of what Orca.
Don_Presant: Don't make me just mentioning so my company learning 
  agents where we do Consulting and we developed a framework for 
  the inter-american development bank and this is a sort of a 
  generic version of that framework that expands in a little bit 
  and it's a the attempt is to try and Encompass this wide spectrum 
  of recognition and diversity of what people are doing so on the 
  left you have the more sort of micro-credentialing.
Don_Presant:  tough and most of it is the assessment certificate.
<kerri_lemoie> Link to slides: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/153qXiNr9xTUWKKev8HytXw84YgLTttzomYdOqvOL8Xc/edit#slide=id.p
Don_Presant: Certifications in other words you're qualified for 
  roll over on the right it's more about you know did you complete 
  of course did you participate in an activity in the middle maybe 
  you're assembling a body of evidence that can may or may not be 
  evaluated by others but way over on the right that's where I 
  think the magic happens and that's why we're here today sings 
  Awards achievements that P reassuring that self issuing ad hoc 
  and and more emergent so it's more appreciative.
Don_Presant:  on the right more summative and authenticate.
<doug_belshaw> /waves
Don_Presant: On the left so Doug belches pulled this together 
  that we are open Co-op I think Doug's on the call today so this 
  is a comparison about how open recognition might compare to my 
  credentials I'm not going to read it all but just sort of have a 
  look and you sort of had this idea on the one side it's very much 
  what's a word a repackaging of certifications certificates.
Don_Presant:  Etc over on the right it's more of.
Don_Presant: Sort of an expansive notion and we think there's 
  room for both it's a big tent but we do find that sometimes 
  there's not enough oxygen for conversations about what should be 
  happening on the right and there's huge value they're both for 
  the individuals and even for others in less formal approaches to 
  to recognition so here are some examples that have been explored 
  over the past number of years where it could.
Don_Presant:  be a selfish.
Don_Presant: I did a hard thing and some scaffolding they're 
  saying why was it hard what did you do why is that significant or 
  it could be I just learned something today or somebody saying 
  that you're a good person to work with and if you have enough of 
  those maybe that starts having some cash a so or I have a hidden 
  talent so in other words I didn't take a course to do this I 
  actually know something already that people don't know about me 
  and I'm asserting that here and then over on the right we have 
  some interesting ones pick up the reins or.
Don_Presant:  her in planning.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> I love the way this comparison 
  draws on discussions we had even in the earliest open badge work 
  groups about individuals issuing badges
Don_Presant: And I'd like to now introduce Anna heyliger who's 
  the author of these badges for million in turn now on the staff 
  at we are open Co-op to tell her story Anna are you there.
Don_Presant: This picture of you.
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks, Anna!
<doug_belshaw> (based on original work by ORA / Serge)
Don_Presant: So I think that's a that's a great segue to this 
  definition that Doug Bell shall pull together that which works 
  for a lot of us and it's just the idea that what we know what we 
  can do who were about really goes beyond credentialing and 
  includes recognizing individuals and communities and where those 
  communities are and and and their right to apply their own 
  definitions and their own.
Don_Presant:  own labels to what they know and can do.
Don_Presant: And those can be rising up or implicit or they can 
  move their way to be explicit but the point is that they're very 
  much rooted in the context and the actual people people involved 
  Doug you may want to add to this.
Don_Presant: If you're there.
<doug_belshaw> Sorry Jitsi wouldn't let me unmute
Don_Presant: No worries I'll just keep moving so I think just to 
  bring things back to this audience it's useful to start talking 
  about ways of extracting value or leveraging this combination of 
  data that can be structured and unstructured and about people and 
  by people so we have for example.
Don_Presant: Bottom left we have credential engine doing great 
  work with other organizations such as HR open to develop very 
  structured approaches to recognition of credentials hiring 
  processes so HR open for example is my understanding is that 
  there was a way of making a it's a essentially a self assertion 
  that can be endorsed by others by Third parties so that's a it's 
  a parallel to what what is.
Don_Presant:  being developed and.
Don_Presant: Example and we also have very unstructured stories 
  on the other hand that are stories in and among themselves so in 
  other words a badge that somebody might have that Anna was 
  talking about it but learning Finnish or existing in a totally 
  different environment for a while so Julie this might be a good 
  time to talk about experience you as yeah.
Julie_Keane: Yeah yeah happy to so experience you and many people 
  on the call may be familiar with this project it's another 
  Walmart funded initiative it's being co-organized by education 
  development Design Lab so long as also helping along with others 
  to basically think about how you use AI to you to turn 
  unstructured data into structured.
Julie_Keane:  de and then lay those on to.
Julie_Keane: Digital and verifiable credentials we are I have a 
  couple of colleagues here on this call that are working with a 
  group called work Bay which focuses on incarcerated folks and 
  they are sort of telling stories it's very difficult to have 
  people sort of self a test particularly when they are in 
  vulnerable and marginalized populations so the idea is to elicit 
  sort of stories using transcripts and then structuring laying 
  that on to more structured.
Julie_Keane:  economies at the.
Julie_Keane: Within the earners control about what gets laid onto 
  it economy and then those are turned into digital credentials so 
  there is a T3 meeting next week many folks on this call will be 
  there and we will be presenting this project along I believed 
  along with 15 other projects that are also using AI to turn 
  unstructured data into structured data.
Julie_Keane: Yeah so follow that yeah.
Don_Presant: So so basically we're saying there should be a 
  balance I mentioned the big tent and we think there should be a 
  way for people to invent themselves and to continue to invent 
  themselves in ways that make sense for their lives and their 
  careers that's this notion of a key guy and or this is the less 
  preferred option the idea that people can be assembled according 
  to skills and put to work.
Don_Presant:  work in.
Don_Presant: So along those lines sarrish is with us today sir 
  well Sarah Jean Nate we co-authored something called the bolonia 
  open recognition declaration in the car on the way to an epic 
  conference in Bologna which Simoni was very very kind to invite 
  us to and it was sort of a cheeky reference to the bolonia 
  framework that for academic Co recognition we thought it should 
  go beyond.
Don_Presant:  and academic recognition.
Don_Presant: These are the principles in other words we think 
  open recognitions for everybody not only to be recognized but to 
  recognize others we think the technology should be able to 
  support that and we think policies and even funding that follows 
  policies should support that as well and it shouldn't just be 
  about repackaging courses as digital credentials so we encourage 
  you to sign read and sign the open wrecking recognition 
  declaration there's actually a badge you can have.
Don_Presant:  have to.
Don_Presant: Or your values and put put put those values out 
  there help build our open recognition Community but further back 
  here in North America be open open recognition work group has 
  developed these more specific I guess recommendations principles 
  to bear in mind as we're developing verifiable credentials open 
  badges version 3 and just some things to think about the.
Don_Presant:  idea of naming your.
<julie_keane> They have  not been formally adopted  by OSN - but 
  we are working on it
Don_Presant: Skills and pot perhaps mapping those later the idea 
  that skills are Dynamic very contextual there's no one framework 
  to rule them all and a commitment to developing tools and 
  networks and ecosystem that's not just top down that can be 
  bought them up and even bridging out peer-to-peer sort of a more 
  mesh mesh Network and the Partnerships that will support that.
Don_Presant: To conclude these are some of the events across the 
  top that are going to be exploring this we have an open 
  recognition thread at the badge Summit coming up in a few weeks 
  and I'll be delivering a virtual webinar about open recognition 
  before that that will be recorded and then that epic 2020 37 
  years after the bolonia open recognition decoration we're still 
  at it albeit in Vienna and some very interesting people.
Don_Presant:  people there including from the South Africa 
  qualifications Authority.
Don_Presant: Ready former CEO will be there and a number of 
  others including Carrie who actually submitted a proposal just 
  last week so we encourage you to submit proposals for that the 
  deadline is just gone but also we will be accepting further later 
  and then obviously you'd be on a very welcome as participants 
  it's really it's a thought leadership conference it's not about 
  presentations as it is so much about dialogue in the meantime we 
  also have the keep badges.
Don_Presant:  weird Community which is now re re.
Don_Presant: And it is.
Don_Presant: Recognition is for everyone and then the the 
  community open skills network.org so I think we can go to slide 
  question and answer.
Don_Presant: Oh sure good idea.
Kerri Lemoie:  It is great everybody before we get a big dog do 
  you mind keeping that slide up to one with the community I like 
  it share the windows of slides are in the chat but where those 
  links are legit I mean I really encourage all of you to really 
  look into all of these different conversations because of the 
  great community of people who have been working together I mean 
  really since I was a 2011. A very very beginning of the badges.
Kerri Lemoie:   I have been having these conversations and it 
  means so much that you conversation between.
Kerri Lemoie:  Why do things like open Badges and verify the 
  credentials start getting adopted two more in the I think it's 
  honestly one of the microcurrent Ali degree representation the 
  more like formal type of learning and recognition but we don't do 
  that in our lives right we're learning all the time and we are we 
  are in communities and we learn from each other and this is part 
  of why I open badges a lot initially there were really thought 
  thank you so much you and Julie for being here and.
Kerri Lemoie:   And I don't see anybody in the few yet by that 
  Julie if you want to like to go.
Kerri Lemoie:  For those discussions.
Kerri Lemoie:  Happy like me money when miss you so much.
Julie_Keane: Sure I mean oh yeah mine are you've been added to 
  the queue so yeah I'm just curious about thoughts I mean you know 
  we're doing you know along with Nate's Oregon you know a lot of 
  other Technologies are really just interested in this community's 
  thoughts about using verifiable credentials around this open 
  recognition piece around sort of recognizing each other how would 
  they sort of be used you know what are some good use cases in 
  addition to stuff that we had worked on historically around.
Julie_Keane:  informal learning.
Manu Sporny:  Thanks Julie um yeah I think my biggest question is 
  kind of from the technical standpoint so the you know the whole 
  the concept makes sense complete sense right education or 
  learning is not just about the all the formal Pathways that we 
  have we also want to recognize the all the informal you know 
  training that we do and in many cases there's a lot of that that 
  goes on through.
Manu Sporny:   You out kind of are.
Manu Sporny:  All careers I guess the main question I have is 
  more technical you know we're talking about you know how do we 
  use the open badges stuff how do we use verifiable credentials to 
  meet the use cases here I guess my question is have you found 
  have you found technical gaps so we're actively working on these 
  kind of global standards right now and we're interested to.
Manu Sporny:  If this Approach at you know recognizing learning 
  has uncovered any company badges 30 or any gaps in verifiable 
  credentials that we could potentially you know patch up fix up 
  before we ship the version 20 work for verifiable credentials 
  that's it.
<julie_keane> Nate? Thoughts?
<julie_keane> Kerri?
<doug_belshaw> I can say something about transactional vs social 
  issuing
Don_Presant: I mentioned that there are a number of technical 
  people supporting me on the call so I think I'm going to throw to 
  them pretty quickly I would say that for us the the thrust has 
  been issuing credentials more sort of pushing pushing them out 
  and there's been a lot less with pulling credentials and making 
  while both curating them and making sense of them and then 
  finding audiences for them so I.
Don_Presant:  I'd say that's.
Don_Presant: Sure that's I've been list that as a technical issue 
  I think it's also a socio-economic one but that would be that 
  would be a key Gap it has been just sort of pumping out tons of 
  badges isn't that great no it isn't it's just an input right so 
  it's what what happens with these things.
Julie_Keane: Again and there's a lot of people in the queue so 
  I'll only add one thing Manos like just knowing what happened the 
  first time that cities of learning at least in North America you 
  know in Chicago was the amount of kids that earn so many badges 
  throughout the city through the cities of learning and never 
  claimed them or use them so to the extent you know and then again 
  I agree with dying that's not a technology may not be answering 
  that but the technology is being more easy more mobile more 
  useful might solve some of that problem all right okay okay a lot 
  of people in the queue here.

Kerri Lemoie:  Gavin I'm next make you so I could say something 
  real quick and then let other people speak one day some folks may 
  not understand really about open badges previously to 3.0 and 
  when I went down and enjoy talking about issuing it means that 
  it's sort of different than how we talk about issues with 
  verifiable credentials with issuing we say and it'll meds like 
  2.0 previously if the file is created there.
Kerri Lemoie:   An email address associated with him and someone 
  was making a statement.
Kerri Lemoie:  Our seniors hosted on a web platform whereas this 
  Majesty Point O and verifiable credentials there's this sense of 
  the learner being in the middle of it and the learner saying Hey 
  I want that credential piece give it to me versus it being just 
  given to them without them really like requiring requesting it I 
  guess our client requesting it to that's a pretty critical change 
  in the technology right to thinking about designing user.
Kerri Lemoie:   Ants and how they might apply to open breakfast.
Kerri Lemoie:  But and also we probably want to think more about 
  right now it's very very organizationally issuer center right in 
  terms of the structure of the spec where we don't really leave so 
  much room for individual stay I am me and I am selfish testing 
  that you can do it but I don't think many expect that in terms of 
  verifiable credentials.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm going to stop there so that other people think 
  us Neo does I'm sorry you're next.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> love this transcription-- I'm 
  sure ants would like to feast on open breakfast ;-)
<julie_keane> hahah
Doug_Belshaw: Hey old man - to make jitsi recognize a microphone 
  so that's all good and just two plus one what scary said and 
  thank you Don for your presentation so I put something in the 
  chat earlier just about something I was thinking about last year 
  which speaks to exactly what Kerry was saying they're all of the 
  focus really understandably has been around issuing and verifying 
  making sure that these people are the people who earned this 
  thing which has meant that really we haven't had as much focus on 
  learning displaying and sharing the kind of social.
Doug_Belshaw:  element of it and so that's Deck that I shared was 
  really just thinking about what if.
Doug_Belshaw: Verifiable credentials with something like activity 
  up like how could you do that in an interesting way to allow 
  socially useful things to happen especially now that we don't 
  necessarily have to have the badge image it kind of lowers the 
  barrier to entry to allow open recognition to happen with 
  verifiable credentials that's all I wanted to say I'm really 
  happy that the so many talented people on the school.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you that's awesome I forgot about that yes I 
  forgot because we always talk about that with open badges but 
  with 3.0 it's not required and it really does also change with 
  that means about how the recognition can be used Nate you are 
  next.
Nate_Otto_(he/him): Thanks money you ask a really good question 
  about you know what technical gaps might we try and patch in this 
  little time between now and like a VC 2.0 release or open badges 
  3.0 final finalization we've done a lot of work on patching up 
  technical gaps over the last few years surges on the column the 
  first presentation I did with him on this topic of what technical 
  gaps are there that are making open badges weird for open 
  recognition was.
Nate_Otto_(he/him):  in 2014 at the open education conference 
  and.
Nate_Otto_(he/him): C and we talked about what Carrie had brought 
  up which is the asymmetry of the construction between the open 
  badges 2.0 issuer which was presumed to have a website where they 
  can post Blobs of Json and the open badges 2.0 recipient which 
  was just an email address the recipient could not become an 
  issuer essentially was the problem with open badges 3.0 adopting 
  the see now we have a common identifier type between these two 
  entities which is we could use dids and that's easier said than 
  done.
Nate_Otto_(he/him):  done but I suspect that the technical gaps 
  that we're going to.
Nate_Otto_(he/him): Really as the previous speaker said in the 
  social layer of it in the service layer rather than in the data 
  model layer for the next sort of stretch of our journey the open 
  badges 3.0 model is incredibly expressive you can do a whole lot 
  of stuff with it to describe a different types of learning 
  achievements as Kerry mentioned no image required anymore so it's 
  really flexible there and we have this whole realm of like 
  self-assertion that is now opening up to us the technical.
Nate_Otto_(he/him):  a layer of how we actually get those 
  individuals.
Nate_Otto_(he/him): Two workers and be able to sign the 
  credentials what technology do we put in their hands to be able 
  to do that that's still an open question and then probably an 
  even bigger harder question is how do we as an ecosystem 
  understand the value of all of these many new issuers thought you 
  know individuals far less formal than even non-traditional 
  education institutions and after-school clubs that open Meadows 
  was originally supported for how do we understand the.
Nate_Otto_(he/him):  the value and the composition of the many.
Nate_Otto_(he/him): Friends that are coming out of individuals on 
  self recognition and peer recognition processes.
Kerri Lemoie:  Dmitri you have the floor
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Hey thanks and so I think Nate touched on a 
  lot of what I was going to mention but to expand on the socio 
  technical difficulty not exactly a gap but I want I want every 
  one of you to start thinking about it so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I think the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The right end of that Spectrum on one of the 
  early slides the self assertions and the peer assertions are 
  incredibly important especially if those self-assertion Czar 
  backed up by evidence right so I can claim that I know HTML but 
  then if I can link to an Evidence of that project that I did 
  online course that I completed it gives it that much more weight.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   So what's needed for.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Well you need a way to link credentials 
  together and cryptographically bind different credentials 
  together and there's several mechanisms for that we explore one 
  of the mechanisms in in a paper with Phil and gold on linked 
  credentials and in fact just these past few weeks the verifiable 
  credential working group added a mechanism to the core data 
  model.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Based on sub resource Integrity but 
  generalizing it that allows credentials to be linked together but 
  that's that's not the interesting part it's going to be useful 
  but that's the low level technical part the main difficulty that 
  we're going to run into that we need to solve if we're to have 
  self asserted credentials with evidence peer-to-peer credentials 
  with evidence is the notion of identity and that's the that's the 
  bit Nate touched.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   On already so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In the verifiable credential the growing 
  importance of trust Registries what do we mean by that lists of 
  known issuers lists of known verifiers when I when somebody hands 
  me a credential signed by a did and a date is just an opaque 
  string a lot of the did methods are how do I know that potential 
  signed by did example 1 2 3 4 5 belongs to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   A mighty belongs to Harvard.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We need these these list of known issuers that 
  correlate credentials to known named entities so we think using 
  using some of the specs doing incubated in the ccg right now.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We have a technical solution to that we still 
  need the hard social and legal lift of who keeps these lists 
  what's the governance how do we trust them all that stuff but 
  we're fairly confident that for four main institutions it's a 
  solvable problem the thing we all should should start thinking 
  about is how do we solve that same problem of identity.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Individuals for self-assertive credentials for 
  peer credentials meaning again II hand just officer to credential 
  or a peer credential and let's say I got a track down my 
  professor at school and got them to give me an Evidence 
  credential a letter of recommendation credential linking to a 
  project I did doesn't matter.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   When somebody is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And they see this credential signed by an 
  opaque did how do they know it belongs to the professor.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Also this notion of.
<doug_belshaw> The thing is that it's still a hierarchical 
  transactional relationship. Identity in that case matters because 
  it's high-stakes. Open Recognition is much likely to be 
  lower-stakes.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Will individual identity intersect with known 
  issue or lists is something that we as a community need to solve 
  so I want everybody to start thinking about that and we'll keep 
  the conversation going thanks.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you Serge you are next
<doug_belshaw> No-one has ever asked me for my doctoral 
  cerificate :)
<kaliya_identitywoman> How do you know who owns a particular DID?
<nate_otto_(he/him)> How ORCA addresses these challenges is that 
  OpenBadgeCredentials are issued by "the community", and peer 
  EndorsementCredentials are issued by individuals within the 
  community (and may sometimes need to be expressed outside the 
  community, in which case initially individual signing keys held 
  custodially by the community). Going beyond that to enable 
  individuals to authorize use of their own signing services via 
  CHAPI might be interesting.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> and linked data connections 
  from within the credentials
<dmitri_zagidulin> the questions I raised still stand though - if 
  a badge was endorsed by an employer, how does the verifier know 
  the identity of the employer? (specifically, that the employer's 
  DID belongs to a registered company?) etc.
Kerri Lemoie:  You are next.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah just to reflect back I think some of the 
  things that I heard all really great stuff so I'm hearing that 
  you know from a technology standpoint we have some of the 
  underpinnings that we would need to make this open recognition 
  stuff work like we've got you know verifiable credentials we have 
  open badges V3 you know we're able to we have these kind of 
  digital wallet things so there's there's some fundamental 
  technologies that exist there and.
Manu Sporny:   Probably not.
Manu Sporny:  Is the problem the difficulty is a little higher up 
  on the technology stack it's like the platform's the platforms 
  that we have currently don't allow easily individuals to issue 
  you know open Badges and for us to understand you know to how to 
  put that individual that has issued the badge in context with 
  with the larger kind of learning ecosystem and that seems to be 
  one of the big challenges.
Manu Sporny:   These are the platforms that we have right now.
Manu Sporny:  And I think it's true the platforms that have been 
  built to date very much kind of follow-up traditional large 
  institution issue or model in what we're looking for is something 
  more Mastodon activity Pub like where you have small social 
  communities that are interacting with each other and want to 
  issue within their communities and ideally have that recognized 
  externally the one thing I wanted to point out to the group is 
  that we.
Manu Sporny:   We're actively working with the.
Manu Sporny:  Community and the Mastodon community so they're 
  very much engaged with at least the digital signature portion of 
  the verifiable credentials 20 work the data Integrity work there 
  they're doing a number of implementations to secure activity Pub 
  messages and that in the mechanism that they're looking at right 
  now the data Integrity stuff is compatible with you know some of 
  the stuff that's been used to secure these verifiable credentials 
  over time so the idea here is that we.
Manu Sporny:   You should be able.
Manu Sporny:  Have these verifiable credentials open badge v30 
  stuff be integrated with the technical platforms that that seems 
  to be a very doable thing but again the problem seems to be a 
  little higher up the stack how do you change that social kind of 
  media server such that it enables people to kind of engage on the 
  social media platform and issue and potentially verify 
  credentials.
Manu Sporny:   As as individuals.
Manu Sporny:  I do agree that that would with number of things to 
  meet reset as well which is you know there are the idea of trust 
  you know how do you how do you trust this and do you determine it 
  through context or do you determine it through a 
  government-issued ID for example those are kind of two two 
  extremes or is it somewhere in between that seems like a really 
  interesting topic for this you know group to try and figure out 
  and solve.
Manu Sporny:   So I'm hoping that I.
Manu Sporny:  You know correctly if there are some technical 
  rough edges with the current specifications you know please do 
  make those known we have another year before we fully ratify 
  verifiable credentials to 0 but we basically enter feature freeze 
  in about two months two to three months so if there is something 
  that you know is desperately needed by this community to support 
  the open recognition stuff now is definitely the time to raise 
  issues on the.
Manu Sporny:   So that we.
Manu Sporny:  Technology in there for this this iteration of the 
  spec thanks.
Kerri Lemoie:  Welcome to My Nail and Deb right next to me.
<taylor_(lef)> Also working with many web3 communities who are 
  directionally aligned (e.g. Protocol Labs, Metamask, etc)
<kayode_ezike> Does Open Recognition codify reputation/credence 
  in some way, such that consumers of an recognition issued by peer 
  P1 to peer P2 understand that recognition from P1 in that domain 
  is passable/credible?
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): So I think my new said a lot of 
  this and also Don in the chat so I'll be brief but it seems to me 
  you know there's a whole range of use cases in terms of what's 
  needed and expected of a trusted network of providers and how you 
  can reliably identify who is who and you know if you're if you're 
  dealing with something that's high stakes credential that.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  that is supposed to verify.
<kerri_lemoie> It's interesting to think about how issuing gets 
  integrated into platforms & practices.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Your skills for potentially 
  dangerous activity like a nurse then they're going to need to be 
  different levels of trust so we can't put everything in the in 
  the same bucket but I think it's really useful to think about 
  contextualizing these trust networks is networks of networks so 
  that you know and in formal credential.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Credential can be considered in 
  the same context is a different type of credential that has 
  different ramifications for the trust Network.
Kerri Lemoie:  Well I definitely have no one else there and I'm 
  going to send it back to Julie and it's me what I've been hearing 
  a lot is about like contacts and about trust just as a brief 
  thought on that is that what the power of embed just 2.0 adoption 
  verify look at a standard is that all of these credentials 10.
Kerri Lemoie:   Be put together weather there.
Kerri Lemoie:  Formal non-formal community that they can be 
  inserted together by the learner they could be packed in this and 
  and verified like technically right in the same way which we 
  never had before which I think is the power here one of the 
  powers care anyway with a lining of provided to standardized 
  verification Julie is that when you close us up.
Don_Presant: Sure I do.
Julie_Keane: Yeah goad up an account on because I think all I 
  would do is just 2 plus 1 what you and Deb said and I mean just 
  building off of the conversation I do think that context is 
  everything and I think personally just getting away from an 
  either or proposition of high-stakes credentials versus kind of 
  peer-to-peer the technology can support all of these things as 
  long as the earner has control over them.
<phil> Are thinking about sharing selected fragment of one's 
  personal graph that the individual selects for the context of a 
  particular single assertion?
Don_Presant: Well I would say + 102 that I mean II came to this I 
  came to open badges through the doorway of a portfolio which 
  unfortunately it has become a very sort of siloed kind of thing 
  and I know Sarah she was very excited when I heard about open 
  Badges and I shared it with him and it certainly has transformed 
  the dialogues were having an epic and I think it really does come 
  down to the control the voice I guess.
Don_Presant:  that the learner and so in other words do a bunch 
  of.
Don_Presant: Is in a wallet is that your voice how what control 
  do you have over that but how can you use those hardened piece of 
  pieces of evidence with a softer pieces of evidence to tell a 
  story about yourself that works for a particular situation 
  whether it's joining Community or trying to get a job and I think 
  that would be and there's big elements of technology in that they 
  have which has been touched on the in this discussion but it's 
  also a cultural thing almost.
Don_Presant:  Stan other words can you can you.
<serge_ravet> Wallets just show the credentials received, while 
  those issued, like endorsements are just as important
Don_Presant: Express Yourself In This Way in an ongoing Dynamic 
  way it's work but I think it's very valuable work for people to 
  have fulfilling lives and just putting the putting the tools and 
  and the realization that the power is there for them to do that 
  and to support what they have with endorsements with hardened 
  pieces of evidence I think it's is really important and that's 
  part of what we're trying to get at in these various communities 
  and these various dialogues.
Don_Presant:  I really learned a lot from today thanks very much.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you guys for being here Thursday I see you 
  in a few Tina to keep it strictly at the end right again there 
  you go thank you.
Phil Barker: +1 To the "narrative credential" to weave together 
  these credential assertions in a data driven story?
Julie_Keane: Don't know no I just I agree with that.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> thank you!
<phil> these are services that wallets need to have api's to ;-)
<doug_belshaw> :wave: cheers all
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah agreed I was I think we're going to have a 
  lot more a while it's going for started to hurt you open 
  recognitions I thank you very much for coming today it'd be great 
  if you could come back and towards the end of the year maybe 
  after of after epic and give us an update on all of this because 
  we love to do this discussion in alignment with the verify the 
  credentials so awesome thank you so much everybody.
Julie_Keane: Everyone happy Monday.
<don_presant> Thanks all!
