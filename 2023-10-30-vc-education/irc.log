[2023-10-30T15:12:44.132Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: This is provided by a decentralized network to promote trust from citizens here previous is must we are not storing personal data in a blockchain just information that is required to enable the verification of information this is completely in line with a green agenda of the commission because we are using protocols with a body low consumption of energy we don't have notes mining blocks this is just based on reputation of the participant if Cecil's following with Europeans.
[2023-10-30T15:12:44.596Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  ovulation like gdpr of a ideas and it's keeping the sword.

[2023-10-30T15:15:12.874Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  education means FC profile and so is including how to.

[2023-10-30T15:15:48.481Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  it's so for that we are providing a self-service confirm until.
[2023-10-30T15:16:22.061Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Different it providers can check if their technology is aligned with our certifications we have to for developers we have an catalog that you can use to send this request to Epsy services and we have also the early adopters program which is an equation program to start piloting different different projects in app see all the all the items that I have already explained they are described in this table in.
[2023-10-30T15:16:22.648Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  this diagram this is defining the four legged model.
[2023-10-30T15:16:53.173Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: In the report of an inside the cyber security agency of the commission is you can take this document in in tonight's public this model is defined in four layers to verify information starting by layer 1 which is the facilities the infrastructure to verify information this is the role of the FCC centralized Network we have also set of items that are needed to represent to support the entities for example the ideas we have here wallets we have services.
[2023-10-30T15:17:19.555Z]	<TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com)>	A link to this deck would be helpful.

[2023-10-30T15:19:40.136Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Okay so this an example of this sort of models you can see there is a root of trust at the beginning the trunk or the model is flexible and is hierarchical so in this example we can see that the Ministry of Education can entitle other actors in this case we can have Regional bodies that have the that can build an additional trust chain to Define which are the universities in a concrete region or data leader root Tau can Define which is the thrust mode.
[2023-10-30T15:19:40.823Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  model for the diploma use case in a member State then.

[2023-10-30T15:20:17.116Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: And before finishing just to include here which information we are storing in the blockchain in The Ledger we have information about entities for example we're storing the Deets matching between identifiers and keys we have for the registry which is the trusted is for registry here we include in the verifiable accreditation this is a type of BC that is connected with an entity and it represent the Declaration that at first.
[2023-10-30T15:20:17.697Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  that is where has we can spin is to pray.

[2023-10-30T15:20:53.162Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  storing personal data in The Ledger what Wales touring is pointers to.

[2023-10-30T15:22:42.358Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  Thrice these represent the the flow to check the complete compliance for the.

[2023-10-30T15:23:15.081Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  verify credentials.
[2023-10-30T15:23:15.195Z]	<Transcriber>	EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: So what we do.

[2023-10-30T15:42:51.169Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Service with limited visibility is the idea there that Epsy itself hosts high-volume API what does what is the trusted service actually look like.
[2023-10-30T15:43:44.723Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I see and and what about the limited visibility part is the idea that the request for given status is Access Control.
