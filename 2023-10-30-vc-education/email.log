<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> Hello all, giving us a few extra 
  minutes before kicking thigs off
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
<cel> transcribing?
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Charles E. Lehner:  Hackathon at DIF if interesting to people as 
  a way of and possibly incentivizing certain some kind of or 
  issuance or verification.
<cel> difhackathon.devpost.com/
PL/T3: Can you can you hear me just a reminder that November 8 is 
  the deadline for those in the u.s. that might be interested in 
  What's called the skills forward RFP which is looking at 
  end-to-end usages of VCS and lers in a skills-based hiring 
  context from issuing through wallet curation and management 
  application to a job and hiring and that.
PL/T3:  deadline is.
PL/T3: To add 11:59 Pacific Daylight Time.
PL/T3: It is also the maximum grants are 1.5 million apiece and 
  they expect to award somewhere between 8 and 12 I suspect.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Okay thanks a lot I will share my 
  screen.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Let me know if you can see my screen in 
  full mode.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Okay let's go so I'm going to spend like 
  only 5 or 10-minute percent in a very tailor-made and short 
  presentation of the project trying to try to resume to summarize 
  for years of work in five minutes I will be quick I don't know if 
  you have any any via any concept of our our project but just to 
  say that the EPS initiative started in 2020 from the.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  Ian block Championship David.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: It was a coalition of the 27 member 
  states Norway little stain on the European commission the main 
  aim of this partnership was to liberate the useful Gene to 
  support public services and to benefit the whole European Society 
  public administration the previous sector and citizens all these 
  based on our Regulatory and Technical sandbox supported by a 
  pan-european infrastructure and the development of use cases and.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  the fcc's infrastructure is based on a 
  dish.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: This is provided by a decentralized 
  network to promote trust from citizens here previous is must we 
  are not storing personal data in a blockchain just information 
  that is required to enable the verification of information this 
  is completely in line with a green agenda of the commission 
  because we are using protocols with a body low consumption of 
  energy we don't have notes mining blocks this is just based on 
  reputation of the participant if Cecil's following with 
  Europeans.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  ovulation like gdpr of a ideas and it's 
  keeping the sword.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Eight because the network is completely 
  supported by member State the European commission doesn't have 
  any role in this network.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Is the the what apps is providing to the 
  verification of the Italy formation I would try to explain this 
  in an approach from bottom to top we have a model that is based 
  on different layers at the bottom we can see the apps in network 
  which is a decentralized network supported member state which is 
  offering a set of services to write and read information in a 
  ledger we have also a complete profile based on a.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  standard together with technical spec.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: To ensure the interoperability between 
  eastwards wallet Three Fires from that we have a set of YF wallet 
  providers that are have technology that is aligned with our 
  specifications later we will show how and what we are doing to 
  ensure the interoperability between this this wallets we have 
  also a set of use cases that are designed from the business 
  sectors and we have a set of factors that are participating in a 
  trust model.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  oh and these are roles that are 
  repeating between the different use cases.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Third use case when we mention a profile 
  this is what we include in a profile to support verify 
  credentials and to support this one's the presentation and the 
  verification of digital information first we explaining how to 
  represent and change the information I mean we are defining a 
  profile to implement protocols for these funds and the 
  presentation of prairie falcon themselves guidelines and also 
  trusted registries refinement.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  store data models that are specifically 
  in every domain.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: We are defining how to identify actors 
  in the exchange of information we have different profiles that 
  are based on the ideas on this Terrace identifiers for no to 
  learning all person we have capabilities to link VC subject and 
  the presenter I mean trusted in the credential percenter binding 
  the credential with with an entity behind MC sangdeok CS Agnostic 
  Front identification is compatible with different current and 
  future I did.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  education means FC profile and so is 
  including how to.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Dorothy is valid information so for that 
  we have deployed set of guidelines to is healer to assign by 
  Falcon serials including support to the current Theatres 
  framework we have a test model to verify its first and 
  accreditation bodies and we have is what Alan is going to be 
  later later the be CSS framework which is a lot of possibilities 
  to enable the verification of the status of different species and 
  finally we consider that the first adoption is key to provide 
  different tools.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  it's so for that we are providing a 
  self-service confirm until.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Different it providers can check if 
  their technology is aligned with our certifications we have to 
  for developers we have an catalog that you can use to send this 
  request to Epsy services and we have also the early adopters 
  program which is an equation program to start piloting different 
  different projects in app see all the all the items that I have 
  already explained they are described in this table in.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  this diagram this is defining the four 
  legged model.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: In the report of an inside the cyber 
  security agency of the commission is you can take this document 
  in in tonight's public this model is defined in four layers to 
  verify information starting by layer 1 which is the facilities 
  the infrastructure to verify information this is the role of the 
  FCC centralized Network we have also set of items that are needed 
  to represent to support the entities for example the ideas we 
  have here wallets we have services.
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> A link to 
  this deck would be helpful.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: A transport a transport protocol to its 
  who and 2% the species based on open ID for BC registry we have 
  the emails that are supporting the different data entities we 
  have processes and procedures and services supporting the life 
  cycle of the default credentials I finally layer for we including 
  here a set of information that should be defined by domain to 
  represent for example how the.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  on the different actors should be 
  aborted.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Which are the process that implanted and 
  Define the issuance processes the process to Define how to 
  activate it the different different models in a complete domain.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Okay honestly it's important to present 
  here and to provide some some contextual information to the to 
  the next section that Alan will present the different roles that 
  are involved in depth Citrus model here we are defining a trust 
  model that is based on the Saint Rose model that ended in Europe 
  we have been working in the last year's we have some actors.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  that are doing things.
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> @Alen, could you share the link to 
  this deck eventually ?
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Other actors that are creating this 
  actors to do these things in FC we call them The Trusted a 
  gradation organization they are representing the root of trust in 
  every domain in every member State we have actors that are 
  appointed by member state to set the source or the root of trust 
  with a fluid actors The Trusted issuers that are entitled by the 
  previous actor by the.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  the towers and they are able to do.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Action in the example of the of the 
  domain of the domain you escapes or diploma is case we have 
  universities for example that are entitled to issue a diplomat 
  credential in a member state in a concrete jurisdiction.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Okay so this an example of this sort of 
  models you can see there is a root of trust at the beginning the 
  trunk or the model is flexible and is hierarchical so in this 
  example we can see that the Ministry of Education can entitle 
  other actors in this case we can have Regional bodies that have 
  the that can build an additional trust chain to Define which are 
  the universities in a concrete region or data leader root Tau can 
  Define which is the thrust mode.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  model for the diploma use case in a 
  member State then.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Appointed by the by the router.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: And before finishing just to include 
  here which information we are storing in the blockchain in The 
  Ledger we have information about entities for example we're 
  storing the Deets matching between identifiers and keys we have 
  for the registry which is the trusted is for registry here we 
  include in the verifiable accreditation this is a type of BC that 
  is connected with an entity and it represent the Declaration that 
  at first.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  that is where has we can spin is to 
  pray.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Vacation renovation we have agreed in 
  our roadmap the receiver buffer by fires if the use case needs 
  also to establish a trust model for the relying parties for the 
  verifiers we also include information about credential for 
  example we are including the schemas of the different verify 
  credentials by domain one example for this is the European 
  learning model for diplomas we have false information about the 
  location we understand we are not.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  storing personal data in The Ledger 
  what Wales touring is pointers to.
<alen_horvat_(ebsi)> @Simone, We'll share the deck(s) after the 
  meeting.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Location information for different 
  species and finally included also in our roadmap we include 
  information about water providers so those wallet providers that 
  are offering technology that is informal we set with hep C we are 
  going is including our roadmap to include a registry for this 
  quality providers in this moment we have more than eighteen 
  eighty providers that are offering technology that is conforming 
  with Pepsi.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  so I will quickly share my screen.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: To present our website where you can 
  take more information.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: About the word FC well confirm 
  intestine.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Okay let me know if you can see my 
  screen again.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Okay so if do yes looking Google or your 
  favorite search engine you can see in our website our wallet 
  confirm and testing here we including services for wallets too.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Sir the compatibility the conformist of 
  that analogy of wallet providers with Epson specifications what 
  we are doing here is to describe four different flows to 
  depending on the the capabilities that you re technology is going 
  to provide focus on the wallet we are defining here the flow from 
  this word to the holder from debris fire to the holder the holder 
  while I dissolve and a different flow for at least another.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  Thrice these represent the the flow to 
  check the complete compliance for the.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: That the greatest organization just to 
  mention here that we have started Lake in 2022 this program the 
  reality program this is an incubator program with different 
  partners different projects that wants to test FC they send the 
  request to us in this moment we are working in cluster what does 
  it mean we are collecting different projects different cities 
  that want to Pilot a capability at the main use case.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  verify credentials.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: So what we do.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Join them in a cluster to build a common 
  artist to build a common scenario come on you three stories and 
  to design the design the the journey and to build a common common 
  Journey a compiler between them we haven't won seven clusters for 
  identity maker credentials.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  proof of.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Earth also for Social Security 
  disability use cases so we have a set of projects based on the 
  different species that they want to Pilot so if you are 
  interested we can provide additional information regarding this 
  this program so now I will pass the floor to to Alan and.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: And he's going to present the services 
  that we are providing for for the revocation service.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Yes we can.
<pl/t3> FYI for SkillsFwd further info:

Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thank you so much and thank you for the 
  presentation those are the most thorough and cogent slides and 
  revocation I've ever seen so like this is this is fantastic my 
  question is about the high volume High Trust.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Service with limited visibility is the idea 
  there that Epsy itself hosts high-volume API what does what is 
  the trusted service actually look like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I see and and what about the limited 
  visibility part is the idea that the request for given status is 
  Access Control.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I see I see okay I got it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks make sense anyone else other questions.
<alen_horvat_(ebsi)> Here's a detailed description 
  https://api-pilot.ebsi.eu/docs/specs/credential-status-framework/credential-status-vcs#dynamic-status-list
<mahesh_balan_-_pocketcred.com> Can you talk a bit about how the 
  crytographic accumulator solution works ?
<mahesh_balan_-_pocketcred.com> thank you
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: If I would take it so we can imagine 
  that suspension is an state in life cycle of a credential but the 
  the life cycle is not limited to that imagine that for example if 
  we're talking about driver license.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Date can be the number of points that 
  are connected to your driving license and when you reach zero 
  this is invalid so in that sense we can suspension as have one 
  choice of many and in the context for example of the start to 
  list this will be very easy we can have like a stool is for 
  revoke.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Or ballot like seed or one we can think 
  in a model where we can Define the different status that can be 
  in this into this life cycle so in that case his suspension is 
  one of the different state that can be heavy Cena in a life cycle 
  in the context of diploma yes I see a good candidate for example 
  the example that you provided that if you don't pay your taxes at 
  any time you can your credential can be on hold.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo:  can be suspended and it can be 
  activated so.
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Be seen as a temporary relocation.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> Excellent overview. Thank you for 
  sharing today!
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: It's all things house for this 
  opportunity to present AB see and the Gypsy approach for 
  revocation feel free to contact us feel free to join us if you 
  are interested in their level the program or if you want to build 
  an Ipsy conform and Technology like for this works wallet or 
  verifier our order to join the level editor parameter so thanks a 
  lot.
<susan_stroud> Thank you for this informative presentation!
<taylor_kendal> Thank you!
<pl/t3> Thanks everyone!
EC_-_Jose_Manuel_Panizo: Think thanks a lot.
