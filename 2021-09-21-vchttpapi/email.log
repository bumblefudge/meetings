Juan Caballero is scribing.
Manu Sporny:  Agenda review
  ... lots of PRs to review
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: +1
Mike Prorock: +1
Joe Andrieu: +1
Orie Steele:  Call times for PRs is fine, but could we come up 
  with a codeowner independent merge consensus?
  ... async work mode would be helpful
Manu Sporny:  SGTM, lots of +1s in chat
Juan Caballero: +1
<mprorock> Whoo hoo!!!! thanks Joe
Joe Andrieu:  Mike Proroclk and Orie Steele have worked with me 
  and Eric to map out the flow of that use-case in more detail
  ... the mapping exercise teased out some edits to the usecase 
  and it's really helpful
  ... to the editorial process
  ... I will add that URL to the minutes shortly
Mike Prorock:

Topic: Introductions and Reintroductions

Kerri Lemoie:  Co-chairing VC-EDU and schedule just allowed me to 
  attend these this week! Excited to be here
Manu Sporny:  For those of you that don't know Kerri, she is 
  awesome.
<joe_andrieu> Hi Kerri!
Juan Caballero: +1 To awesomeness
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks Manu :)

Topic: Merge Windows

Orie Steele:  Since this isn't a formal WG, we should leverage 
  that freedom and work faster, particularly since working fast 
  increases chances of this going standards track later
  ... aiming for faster PRs, more frequent PRs, and operate under 
  the "UNSTABLE COMMUNITY DRAFT" banner
  ... merging major changes with positive feedback and 1 or 2 
  reviews could be merged on day 7 without discussion on call, and 
  minor PRs even faster, is a policy i would support
  ... I would recommend no PR stay open over a week if there are 
  no changes requested by 2+ reviewers
<orie> yes
Manu Sporny:  To clarify, editorial and non-substantive at 
  discretion of editors, for substantive feedback, leave open for 7 
  or longer if it takes longer to resolve change requests
<orie> PROPOSAL 1: Any editorial PR can be merged as soon as 2 
  code owners approve the PR.
<orie> PROPOSAL 2: Any none editorial PR can be merged as soon as 
  2 code owners approve the PR, and its been open without change 
  request for a minimum of 7 days.

PROPOSAL:  Any editorial PR can be merged as soon as 2 code 
  owners approve the PR.

Manu Sporny: +1
Joe Andrieu: +1
Orie Steele: +1
Mike Prorock: +1
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: +1
Adrian Gropper: +1
Juan Caballero: +1

RESOLUTION: Any editorial PR can be merged as soon as 2 code 
  owners approve the PR.

PROPOSAL:  Any none editorial PR can be merged as soon as 2 code 
  owners approve the PR, and its been open without change request 
  for a minimum of 7 days.

Mike Prorock: +1 Lots of gaming on that kind of thing
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  7 Days since last change req?
<orie> YES
Manu Sporny:  But that opens the door to a lot of gaming
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Would adding code owners req'd for approval 
  help?
Orie Steele:  I don't think that helps, 2 will tag the 3rd if 
  there's a problem
  ... and besides if our codeowners can't triage this many PRs in 
  a timely manner we can get new ones
  ... and we should use change request feature in github to be 
  very clear and direct
  ... even if the change request is "i will not support any form 
  of this PR" (written into the CR window of the GH interface)
Orie Steele: +1 To being early in the game... we should not be 
  processing contributors to death...
Mike Prorock: +1 Joe - it is also pretty easy to go put another 
  PR in to adjust something as needed
Joe Andrieu:  I think we should remind ourselves we're in 
  INCUBATION MODE and other processes in incubation mode work in 
  google docs and very quickly
<brent> I think 7 days is fine, especially in view of the desired 
  iterative process.
  ... so we shouldn't let the GH format put us into a very 
  deliberative process autopilot
Manu Sporny:  I sympathize with both sides of this, we can't be 
  too cautious but there are reasons to be cautious even though 
  we're at such an early stage
<mahmoud> happy 2 or 3
  ... so we can go ahead with Brent's version, then, if Mahmoud 
  is happy

PROPOSAL:   Any non-editorial PR can be merged as soon as 2 code 
  owners approve the PR, if it has been open for a minimum of 7 
  days and change requests have been addressed.

Mahmoud Alkhraishi: +1
Manu Sporny: +1
Brent Zundel: +1
Mike Prorock: +1
Orie Steele: +1
Adrian Gropper: +1
Joe Andrieu: +1
Juan Caballero: +1
Eric Schuh: +1

RESOLUTION: Any non-editorial PR can be merged as soon as 2 code 
  owners approve the PR, if it has been open for a minimum of 7 
  days and change requests have been addressed.

Manu Sporny:  That work for you, Orie?
Orie Steele:  Yup, I might suggest we start using this 
  immediately (like, the rest of this call)

Topic: Renaming VC HTTP API to VC API

Manu Sporny: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Aug/0297.html
Mike Prorock:  You can't object to non-resolutions
  ...it was informative, so no action needs to be taken to the 
  "formal" objection
Manu Sporny:  Call for objections to renaming
No objections raised

PROPOSAL:  Rename the VC HTTP API to become the VC API.

Orie Steele: +1
Manu Sporny:  <Types proposal while reading it out loud>
Manu Sporny: +1
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: +1
Juan Caballero: +1
<joe_andrieu> +100
Kerri Lemoie: +1
Mike Prorock: +1
Adrian Gropper: +1
Juan Caballero:  I feel you, Joe
Brent Zundel: -0
<mprorock> lol
<mprorock> yes
<kerri_lemoie> HaH

RESOLUTION: Rename the VC HTTP API to become the VC API.

Joe Andrieu:  Just want to remark a famous remark of Tim 
  Berners-Lee that he would never have named it HTTP if he'd known 
  people would be saying URLs out loud every day
<orie> its cool, some browser vendors hide it anyway...
<manu> Just to clarify, the full name of the renamed 
  specification should be "The Verifiable Credential API"
<mprorock> i insist on RPC /s
Justin Richer: Did:vc:soap
Orie Steele: +1 To soap.
<justin_richer> why does : vc : turn into :vc: here??
Manu Sporny: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/224
<justin_richer> (jitsie has a flag, fwiw)
^ ðŸ‘€

Topic: Pull Request 224 - Resolutions in Spec

Mike Prorock: +1 To closing
<orie> please close confusing and outdated PRs.
<mahmoud> close
Joe Andrieu: +1 To close
<mprorock> we can cherry pick good language out to use in other 
  PRs
<orie> 9

Topic: Pull Request 226 - RAR and GNAP

Manu Sporny: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/226
Manu Sporny:  Thanks to Justin for writing this up, lots of 
  discussion.  some of this content has been moved to other PRs
Manu Sporny:  How should we move forward with this, workflow and 
  order of operations a little confusing
Justin Richer:  I marked this as a draft so as NOT to be merged. 
  I put this in as a straw man/examples of the language the group 
  *could* write
  ... i think open or closed, this PR would be a good thing to 
  cut and paste.  I wanted it in the repo because I felt words kept 
  getting put in my mouth
Mike Prorock: +1 Some very good language in here - note I think a 
  lot has already been pulled out into other PRs
  ... I think this group has been happy to do things like work 
  with scope strings, and I think the comments in this thread are 
  good questions about designing APIs with actions in mind
<orie> I provided feedback on the PR, but it has not been 
  addressed.
Manu Sporny:  I would recommend we leave it open as a draft PR so 
  that we keep referring to it
<mprorock> @orie - this is a draft PR - have some of the other 
  PRs covered your comments?
  ... I think the AuthZ PRs that have been broken out of it 
  already, and leaving it open keeps our options open if we add 
  sections later that could also borrow from this
<orie> possibly... Im not against the idea behind his PR...
<orie> But it needs to graduate into a mergeable state.
Adrian Gropper:  I'm glad to keep this open, and propose we not 
  return to it until AuthZ sections have been substanciated a bit 
  more
<orie> Justin is correct
<orie> we can't merge a draft.
Draft status is fine
<justin_richer> I marked it draft so it wouldn't be merged, it 
  would be discussed.
<orie> draft is fine, I won't approve it until it is mergeable 
  and feedback is addressed.
Manu Sporny:  A label would be technically redundant but help 
  scanning a long list of PRs
<justin_richer> I suggest "draft" because it has mechanical 
  enforcement
<orie> ^ i think Justin did the right thin.
Mike Prorock: +1 Orie
<justin_richer> I don't care if you label it
<mahmoud> draft is fine
Draft is displayed in faint grey on the list by default
So it technically already displays it... just not in bright 
  colors :D
<orie> its called "request changes"
<orie> ffs
Justin Richer: +1 To orie
I think repo admins can bump a PR from or to draft
<justin_richer> we can't
<justin_richer> ?
<mprorock> there is a do not merge label in there
Juan Caballero: +1
<brent> sorry for jumping queue
<justin_richer> labels don't block merge either
Ted Thibodeau:  Yes you can merge with requested changes open, 
  and yes, you can mark someone else's PR as draft
<orie> they do in the ccgg
  ... if you have admin rights
<orie> we just agreed to that...
<mprorock> there is a do not merge label
Ted Thibodeau: +1 Create label, apply it to this PR.  it may be 
  rarely used, but it's useful nonetheless.
<orie> you ccan mere over the do not merge label too
Mike Prorock: +1 Orie
Orie Steele: +1 Justin!
Manu Sporny:  I think you can only mark draft on a PR from a fork
<mprorock> we need to trust the editors to read the comments for 
  objections, changes requestd, etc
Justin Richer:  I'm not a fan of "do not merge" because it can be 
  used passive-aggressively
<brent> on github repos where I have proper access I can convert 
  any PR to draft.
<tallted> draft theoretically means that its author doesn't think 
  it's ready for others to review, it exits draft for others to 
  review, and *then* the merge question comes up.
Orie Steele:  These descriptive labels are kind of orthogonal to 
  the behavior we're expecting in the code owners
  ... i think we need to remember the editors have power and 
  responsibility
Manu Sporny:  No op and move on?
<justin_richer> moving on is nice
Mike Prorock: +1 Justin

Topic: Pull Request 227 - Single Word Change

https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/227
Manu Sporny:  Good example of new policy, SHIP IT

Topic: Pull Request 228 - Intro to Authz Section

https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/228
<justin_richer> as an aside, this group is absolutely killing 
  itself with process, in my opinion
Orie Steele: +1 Justin.
Mike Prorock: +1 Justin
<orie> The same applies to this PR.
<orie> its been open for 10 days, no change requests
<orie> it should be merged immediatly
<orie> please merge it @manu.
<orie> they had 10 days to review it....
<orie> we just agreed to apply that policy.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: +1 To Orie's point, assuming adrian's new 
  CR's regarding the new name are accepted
Manu Sporny:  Here is a good test case where I'm worried about 
  the new policy being applied literally
<orie> just request changes if you want to block the PR... its 
  trivial to do.
<orie> thanks Justin!
Justin Richer:  Here is an editorial hackjob that takes the 
  letter of my comment and not the spirit. I do not like this PR
<tallted> Multiple open change requests ... and says it's a 
  partial substitute for #226, which also remains open, so what's 
  the actual choice to be made?
Mike Prorock: Note: Joe has good editorial changes requested
Manu Sporny:  That sounds like no objection to merge to me
Adrian Gropper:  I think this reflects a particular API AuthZ 
  strategy and I'd rather this PR stay open
<orie> there are no change requests, blocking the PR....
Ted Thibodeau:  This opens with a confusing "Partial alternate to 
  another open PR" disclaimer so it feels hedgey
<orie> use the "request for change feature"
  ... I think the 226 versus alternatives thing is hard to parse
Mike Prorock:  But if 226 is in draft and it's intended as a 
  reference, this isn't an alternative, it's an offshoot of!
<orie> I requested changes
<orie> now it can't be mergged
ðŸ˜­

Topic: Pull Request 229 - Forbidden Authorization

https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/229
<orie> I have requested changes on this PR.

Topic: Pull Request 230 - Authorization Delegation

https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/230
<justin_richer> ZCAP and GNAP solve completely different 
  problems, though ...
<orie> a normative statemen in a community draft...
Manu Sporny:  Adrian does this make you happy or sad?
<orie> I suggest approving or requesting changes Adrian and 
  Justin.
<orie> I don't care about your feelings, but would love to see a 
  PR review on this ;)
<orie> ( I do care about your feelings )
Adrian Gropper:  As I've said before, I am interested in 
  consensus on ideological questions, not low-level spec language.
<orie> :)
Manu Sporny:  I don't know how to help, we are working on spec 
  language here.  I keep trying to channel your comments as best I 
  can in drafting these PRs
Orie Steele: +1 David
<orie> I will request changes
<juan_caballero>	david_chadwick: i'm putting a comment in that 
  should --> MAY because in some spec contexts, SHOULDs are 
  interpreted as MUSTS
Ted Thibodeau:  I strongly disagree, SHOULD means MUST UNLESS YOU 
  KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.  MAY is way too open/loose
<orie> I agree with David, and I requested changes.
<orie> it now can't be merged.
Adrian Gropper:  In contexts I've worked on, SHOULD has to be 
  tested by conformance tests even if at deployment it isn't 
  required
Adrian's comment on testing conforms with my understanding
<dmitri_zagidulin>	orie: i'd be interested to know why (re should 
  -> MAY), from you
<orie> I don't think anyone SHOULD use GNAP or ZCAPs ; )
<dmitri_zagidulin> thanks.

Topic: Pull Request 231 - OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens

https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/231
Manu Sporny:  I think these PRs parallelizes and 
  compartmentalizes the options for AuthZ
<mprorock> can we accept Ted's changes and merge it?
Orie Steele:  Manu could you accept Ted's changes and merge on 
  the call now?
<orie> Thanks for the change request @TallTed!
Justin Richer:  I think the language in this PR doesn't make 
  sense to me, needs work
<orie> Justin, try using the "PR Review feature" of GitHub : )
Orie Steele:  Try using less snark :) [scribe assist by Justin 
  Richer]
<orie> I learned from the best
Manu Sporny:  I think there is a new PR (233) that I'd love the 
  group to review
<mprorock> this call was all snark
Thanks all
