  week's meeting invite.
<kimhd> That is all that we have for the intro stuff so carrie if 
  you're ready to take over with the ongoing discussion and open 
  badge verifiable credentials think we're ready for you and I can 
  paste the slides into here.

Topic: OBs and VCs, continued

<kerri_lemoie> awesome Thank you hear me okay cuz I haven't air 
  conditioner on behind me, make sure i'm clear enough to be part 
  yeah yeah okay.
<kerri_lemoie> i'm going to go ahead and share my screen.
<kerri_lemoie> And Hello everybody today I am working from from 
  Rhode island i'm visiting family in England, so I am on one 
  laptop about my my dual screen see my presentations pulling from 
  a day.
<kerri_lemoie> And we this these slides are the same size we've 
  been using over the past few weeks and i'm just adding content to 
  them so For those of you haven't been on the call are all costs 
  of farms me show you that what we're doing is discussing.
<kerri_lemoie> Open badges and verifiable credential matters as 
  verifiable contentious we're just we're working on this at IMS 
  billable badges work.
<kerri_lemoie> And we wanted to have these discussions here 
  because we've been thinking this group has been talking about 
  verifiable credentials and education.
<kerri_lemoie> And we thought well why don't we discuss what is 
  one way of doing this one way of doing this one simple one 
  credential is open badges.
<kerri_lemoie> So i'm not going to go through our decides because 
  it's what the discussions have been every time but feel free to 
  to walk through these.
<kerri_lemoie> and see my pretty diagrams here, especially 
  insides two and four, and what I want to point us to, though, is 
  side five because we're going to be sort of starting from here, 
  and then going to slide seven so side five is like an overall 
  example of an open badges vc assertion.
<kerri_lemoie> And so, this is a full on this is what it would 
  look like or a close to what it should look like for an open 
  badge and as a verifiable credential, this is still being worked 
  on being proposed, at my Ms Ms global right now.
<kerri_lemoie> And then i'm going to take you here to slide 
  seven, where we have two other examples, this is what we're going 
  to talk about today, which is more focused on the actual.
<kerri_lemoie> content of the of the credential and in verifiable 
  credentials is they were talking about the credentials subject.
<kerri_lemoie> And today we're talking about what a badge classic 
  example of a verifiable credential crystal subject would look 
  like So the first thing, given this side goes directly to the vc 
  data model um spec i'm going to open it up here.
<kerri_lemoie> And so, this is a credential subject property.
<kerri_lemoie> And in this example, it has when ID, which is the 
  in open badges this would be the recipient, this is a good 
  example of a recipient.
<kerri_lemoie> And what they did in this data model example is 
  they created from the College degree and i'm the type is a 
  bachelor degree, that is a very, very simple use example of a 
  credential subject.
<kerri_lemoie> The next one, is a little bit more complex, and 
  this would illustrate something i'd be different in verifiable 
  credentials and would be different in open badges which a 
  perennial subject can be an array of claims, so it could actually 
  be two different claims going to two different recipients.
<kerri_lemoie> And, but you'll see that the issuer you'll you 
  don't see actually the issuer isn't in here, but it would be the 
  same issuer for both of these.
<kerri_lemoie> So then, if you go back to the slides.
<kerri_lemoie> And you click on the second thing is i'm an 
  example of an open badges batch class inside of credentials.
<kerri_lemoie> And this is what we're working on now in the 
  proposal at IMS little.
<kerri_lemoie> So here looks a little bit different, and let me 
  just good to have you here, so this is the same setup right, this 
  is the credential subject.
<kerri_lemoie> And we have this idea, which is the recipient ID 
  and i'm in a week or so when we have a chance we can talk about 
  what could go in here for another bad right now in this example 
  it's a decentralized identify.
<kerri_lemoie> And then in here, where we were talking what we've 
  been talking about in this group around looking at this is Level 
  two, which is a using schema.org property has credentials.
<kerri_lemoie> Which references and education or occupational 
  credential and what we have in here you'll see it looks very 
  simple it's very similar to a batch class.
<kerri_lemoie> And so we have this ID, which is the canonical URL 
  that references a batch class batch class Jason O D we're saying 
  this is a type batch class.
<kerri_lemoie> My name is summer summer you'll see in the 
  documentation for of open badges in the open awesome robotics add 
  the description.
<kerri_lemoie> And image of the badge and this year we can come 
  back to this at some other point because there's issuer could be 
  the same or different issuer.
<kerri_lemoie> The nature of the verifiable credentials going to 
  make about today, but we can pass on if we don't get to it.
<kerri_lemoie> And then, this criteria and the tags some property 
  alignments and then down here, where we have a little bit 
  different is we have.
<kerri_lemoie> Evidence which in open badges was part of the 
  overall i'm assertion what we're doing here, and I believe I got 
  it right and that's part of what we're discussing is evidence has 
  been reference to the hospital.
<kerri_lemoie> So i'm sorry the credential subject now has 
  credential because it has credential pipe describes would 
  essentially be the batch class for the content of the open badge 
  being issued as her credentials.
<kerri_lemoie> And slide eight i'm going to go through all of 
  these, and then we can just talk about it all on slide eight.
<kerri_lemoie> I just put some primary comparison points so in 
  laughter verify look into subject can have an array of claims 
  with multiple recipients, and right now there are no actual.
<kerri_lemoie> attributes for education and verifiable 
  credentials just an example attributes that are in the data model 
  and verifiable claims, with the batch class, we are, we are 
  shooting the one recipient and one claim.
<kerri_lemoie> And they're already a bunch of badges attributes 
  where we can describe this plan, so these already exists as 
  context for this.
<kerri_lemoie> And we can actually add to this so, for instance, 
  one of the properties, we would like to add as part of the magic 
  or no proposal were suggesting is something called achievement 
  type without solid lines is global's comprehensive learning.
<kerri_lemoie> Learning record the car we don't like what is this 
  is achievement type and then you can add a type of.
<kerri_lemoie> This list of achievements these strings associated 
  with a badge which we never had in batches before which I think 
  is pretty great actually so he's been in badges for a while, 
  because.
<kerri_lemoie> You know there's always been this whole like oh 
  bad just something like small, it can be very significant and 
  it's just as one thing that actually.
<kerri_lemoie> Open batch could always have been anything right 
  given any of these things and others so um I think getting this 
  type will actually add a lot of power to badness.
<kerri_lemoie> Okay, so i'm going to pause there that that those 
  the only slides i'm showing today just so we can talk about this 
  aspect, this part of open badges verifiable bit of just.
<kerri_lemoie> Stop sharing now.
<kimhd> And Eric is on the queue.
<kerri_lemoie> awesome.
<> hey.
<eric_kuhn> Sorry, can you hear me.
<kerri_lemoie> I can.
<eric_kuhn> Okay, so can you explain the part of that you 
  mentioned about the biomedical car and how the achievement, I 
  worked with that because, are they isn't open badges that spec 
  and the highest level to our spec totally different things So how 
  do they work together and I guess, could you just.
<eric_kuhn> dive a little deeper into that.
<kerri_lemoie> I can, and then there are folks here who wants to 
  steal our but i'm going to take a stab at it and then let's jump 
  in here.
<eric_kuhn> So an open badge.
<kerri_lemoie> With first raised about 10 years old.
<kerri_lemoie> That specification and described to single 
  achievement.
<kerri_lemoie> And it had a better two point O has basically 
  three aspects main aspect, it has an assertion inside of 
  assertion as reference for batch class that batch class opens is 
  an issue.
<kerri_lemoie> And I see a lot is intended to be a collection of 
  achievements that are published any of those achievements could 
  be open badges.
<kerri_lemoie> So it is actually an array of achievements, so 
  what would be great as it actually got more harmonized so if a 
  car, has an achievement type.
<kerri_lemoie> It would be an array of achievements that each 
  event would be saved in a car, has an open badge that specific 
  achievement in the array would be badge.
<kerri_lemoie> But it could also be something out to be a degree 
  or something else, so an open badges what we're saying is you can 
  deliver a single if you've been like a single degree and a 
  single.
<kerri_lemoie> certificate, as with the open badge specification.
<eric_kuhn> For would it also be correct to say that many open 
  badges as vcs that are a combination of degrees certificate, you 
  know, etc.
<eric_kuhn> All of those fees in your wallet people I feel are, 
  or is it.
<kerri_lemoie> Now it's something different, so what we're not 
  talking about yet in July, which will be taught after we figure 
  out this magic part of it is, is what does a car version of a vc 
  look like.
<kerri_lemoie> But what you could do is you can take open badges 
  as verifiable credentials and present them, so the learner could 
  present them together as their achievements.
<kerri_lemoie> But the car right now, mostly is from someone else 
  may jump into the car can be presented by a learner as it is as 
  one set of achievements to so that is something else, but right 
  now.
<kerri_lemoie> I think it might be awkward right now to put 
  verifiable credentials inside of a seal I think people are trying 
  to do it, but I think we should pause on that and do it right, as 
  we get to that stage that's that's my opinion on it anyway.
<kerri_lemoie> Did I confuse you even more with that answer.
<eric_kuhn> um.
<eric_kuhn> I still have some questions, but our next person.
<kerri_lemoie> Okay, well, if we can get back to what Anthony.
<anthony_camilleri> Sorry, I was talking into the ether ah so two 
  questions um first of all.
<anthony_camilleri> In terms of the properties, you are showing 
  on the credentials subject I Is this the idea that this is what a 
  batch class would look like in a vc.
<anthony_camilleri> Or do you feel that some of these properties 
  could be universal, for any verifiable credential and education, 
  and then the second comment is.
<anthony_camilleri> In terms of let's say referring to the image 
  that represents the badge i'm just wondering allowed if that 
  belongs inside.
<anthony_camilleri> Let the inside the credential subject, or 
  possibly in some kind of display properties tab one level higher.
<kerri_lemoie> So we are only talking about open badges map DC 
  edgy Bradley we are specifically saying this is what it would 
  look like with open badges in a vc.
<kerri_lemoie> And right now the image property for an open 
  badges in the batch class.
<kerri_lemoie> To that that's all we're discussing right now, 
  very simply, this is the work has been proposed today and master 
  but.
<kerri_lemoie> Not not vc Thank you.
<kerri_lemoie> um but it's applicable, obviously, we would like 
  folks at BCG to have a look at this and have some boxing yeah, 
  let us know what you think about this does that make sense.
<anthony_camilleri> It does.
<kerri_lemoie> Okay.
<kerri_lemoie> Eric i'm looking at the queue here I go one did 
  you want to jump in.
<juan_caballero> No i'm good.
<kerri_lemoie> you're good okay.
<kerri_lemoie> i'm Andy.
<andy_miller> Carry.
<andy_miller> The example with multiple credential subjects is it 
  important that the.
<andy_miller> The essentially the recipient be different, in 
  other words, could you have multiple credential subjects all all 
  with the same recipient in a single PC.
<kerri_lemoie> And a vc I believe you could but not an open badge 
  so.
<andy_miller> Okay right, so the I got it okay.
<kerri_lemoie> I wanted to make a comparison.
<kerri_lemoie> Between these two, which is why should the vc 
  example.
<andy_miller> got it and they did, but you wouldn't recommend 
  that when it's when it's open badges you not do that, you don't 
  don't.
<> that's.
<andy_miller> Great.
<kerri_lemoie> Because will open badges is simply is is one claim 
  to one recipient, I want to sure, so that is why it is one single 
  focus there.
<kerri_lemoie> I know that folks are very interested in having 
  multiple claims with NBC and I know that's going to come up in 
  the future hall that's just not what today is about.
<andy_miller> For sure yeah I think it would have been actually a 
  little confused me at least if if you could do that so i'm glad 
  you thanks.
<kerri_lemoie> Great Thank you.
<ottomomy> hey I just respond to any they're only I think if you 
  read the the vcs back, I think it is technically possible to do 
  that, to put two different claim sets in a vc where the ID is the 
  same between them and you're basically making two different sets 
  of claims about the same entity.
<ottomomy> Why, you know suppose I suppose that a standards body 
  or something could recommend that that approach would be valid 
  that they essentially want to express multiple credentials all 
  signed under a single bundle.
<ottomomy> But if you think about what you lose by doing that you 
  lose the ability for the recipient or anyone to express only one 
  of those credentials, at a time in a verifiable sense if you 
  wanted to include them in a verifiable presentation.
<ottomomy> To prove the credential that you have you would have 
  to present them together, you would not have the capability of 
  presenting them apart.
<ottomomy> And I think if we wanted to achieve a capability sort 
  of in like a transcript like use case.
<ottomomy> Where there are a set of credentials that do go 
  together, and it is important at certain times to be able to see 
  that that entire set has been delivered in whole.
<ottomomy> I don't think this is the approach that I would 
  recommend using in order to accomplish that use case I would 
  probably recommend just sort of wrapping each credential that is 
  independently verifiable inside some broader structure.
<ottomomy> which potentially could be a verifiable presentation, 
  or it could be just another receipt that includes you know, 
  several others with the different schema.
<kerri_lemoie> That.
<kerri_lemoie> Maybe.
<marty_reed> Yes, I just wanted to find great work the clues in 
  collision of achievement tab I think is hugely valuable and kind 
  of being able to bring these things.
<marty_reed> Together, and I will say that.
<marty_reed> You know, based on the guidance of this group 
  there's a complex credential work group seven group is that 
  we've.
<marty_reed> been working through discussing.
<marty_reed> You know what those what those multi expression 
  complex credentials look like, so if anyone is interested in 
  joining that please reach out to me and i'll happily invite you, 
  and then and then i'm curious just from the.
<marty_reed> From the group's.
<marty_reed> Understanding.
<marty_reed> We hear a lot about.
<marty_reed> verifiable presentation I just haven't seen it, and 
  so you know utility requires.
<marty_reed> That you know, then you embed a vc inside of vc 
  which is not that hard.
<marty_reed> Then you can re express it individually again not 
  elegant but but timely and and so just curious how the group 
  thinks about verifiable presentations or any any.
<marty_reed> example.
<marty_reed> Examples of that out there in the field.
<kerri_lemoie> Or the ice cubes in the QC she has a brief answer 
  for this mighty can let her go.
<kimhd> In we're gonna say the more complete treatment to another 
  call, I think the only other person I might ask to chime in would 
  be one who's been working on these through the.
<kimhd> The vc http API groups, but essentially if the verifiable 
  presentation is a way to repackage and prove control over 
  identifiers in the embedded verifiable credentials.
<kimhd> And there are different things you know, depending on the 
  signature suites that you're using you know you could that's 
  where you can also start doing more interesting selective 
  disclosure kinds of.
<juan_caballero> Work bad.
<kimhd> You can think of it as a way to just bundle a set of 
  credentials together and say also proved control over it, and 
  i'll call on one I see him on.
<juan_caballero> yeah so.
<juan_caballero> So.
<juan_caballero> I think VP is i've always been a little less 
  standardized than vcs so some people's weepies look like a vc.
<juan_caballero> And some get a little more creative, but the, 
  but I think the, the main thing is that.
<juan_caballero> Like nate was pointing out there's there's what 
  is allowed by the spec and then there's a separate question of 
  like what's realistic for interoperability or portability so 
  sometimes.
<juan_caballero> There are default assumptions made by lots of 
  people that you wouldn't be breaking spec to vary from but it 
  might make it harder to interoperate if you did, and one of those 
  is like.
<juan_caballero> The you know, a VP is signed by the holder and 
  it signs over the contents, a challenge and with the holders key 
  material and.
<juan_caballero> How the vcs relate to each other is a little 
  under specified I mean, some people have have been trying to 
  specify it, but it may be, in a way that isn't really universal 
  enough to be helpful.
<juan_caballero> So I think the the thing there, I mean the 
  general assumption is that you know the the use case that most 
  people that the assumptions, most people bring to every VP use 
  case is that the subject of at least one of the credentials is 
  the holder signing them, and I think some of them more.
<juan_caballero> hotly contested corner cases our VP is where the 
  presenter who holds all the credentials is the subject of none of 
  the sorry yeah and so that might be.
<juan_caballero> Maybe an unusually academic answer.
<juan_caballero> But it's what I got.
<marty_reed> make sense thanks one.
<kimhd> and carry out just real fast.
<kimhd> there's, as you can see in the comments there's a lot of 
  extra stuff going on, and I think.
<kimhd> we'll come back to that later because, certainly when it 
  comes to packaging up a set of verifiable credentials it gets 
  interesting I think one of the reasons we wanted to.
<kimhd> defer this discussion is in line with why we're focusing 
  on open badges first just to sort of pick something very concrete 
  and specific that we can make more progress on before getting 
  into the more complicated cases.
<kerri_lemoie> yeah.
<kerri_lemoie> Exactly we're really just hoping to work on this 
  like one simple aspect, because we know there are a lot more 
  complex cases and that.
<kerri_lemoie> Presenting one of them badge is very different 
  than presenting more than one, amongst many other credentials and 
  when we started looking at all of this, and especially.
<kerri_lemoie> You know, with the learning and employment or 
  record rapper we were trying to figure out okay let's just really 
  sort of focused, because we know that that much market happened 
  in this space.
<kerri_lemoie> But we know that this is a good, solid spec that a 
  lot of people understand that already using so it makes for good 
  discussion.
<kerri_lemoie> They could actually lead into these other points 
  it's really great to see the discussion in the chat so that we 
  know how to help them direction of the spiritual to distress.
<kerri_lemoie> And do any folks have any sort of questions other 
  questions about.
<kerri_lemoie> You know the properties of open badges batch class 
  and how and like has credential and how that works.
<kerri_lemoie> I know many of you do already understand open 
  badges, but I just want to make sure that I will share that 
  again.
<kerri_lemoie> This isn't a complete open badge, but it has quite 
  a bit of of what could go into in a batch in the batch class.
<kerri_lemoie> Well then, i'm there was a discussion that I was 
  going to pause on, but we have a bunch of time here, so I might 
  as well get into it a little bit Oh, the mighty mighty fees 
  before.
<marty_reed> I had when I didn't jump on the plane.
<marty_reed> In the evidence.
<marty_reed> Is there going to be a consideration for attachments 
  or how are you thinking about that.
<kerri_lemoie> um I don't think so, I mean we haven't gotten to 
  that discussion, yet, so I don't have a definitive answer on 
  that, but I don't know I don't think so.
<ottomomy> You know, we can't answer questions here about sort of 
  like what scope will IMS select for what open badges becomes, but 
  we can talk about the generic sentence in verifiable credentials 
  community about.
<ottomomy> If we have a known relationship between a credential 
  subject and it sort of has evidence claim.
<ottomomy> There are other properties in schema.org that can be 
  used to define evidence, and so, if there's a use case for 
  attachments you know you might want to go through a standards 
  body.
<ottomomy> To bring that up there, or we might come up with a 
  very beneficial approach here, because schema.org does have 
  properties, such as like full text or something like that of a 
  creative work and evidence is based on creative work, so we can 
  draw.
<ottomomy> You know extra stuff if we want if there's a profile 
  link I definitely encourage small file sizes inside of 
  credentials, if possible, so you might have some sort of like 
  hash link approach that would be useful, sorry to jump the queue.
<marty_reed> yeah there's definitely I mean there's definitely 
  use case but I agree 100% nate there's there's.
<marty_reed> A lot of size constraints out there.
<marty_reed> As you traverse different networks, especially 
  whenever you're repackaging and resigning with.
<marty_reed> Did within that arena so just just curious about how 
  everyone's thinking about that or how we, you know influence.
<marty_reed> Or at least understand best practice as everyone's 
  thinking about thing.
<kerri_lemoie> yeah I think you know not that long ago there was 
  a really great discussion on the CCD pile about embedding data in 
  pdfs.
<kerri_lemoie> And I don't know when that was this is carmine 
  weiner here I mean do you have any thoughts on embedding evidence 
  in verifiable credentials in a broadly speaking.
<kerri_lemoie> Or, or about baking data into baking but embedding 
  data into into graphics or images or files.
<kimhd> Oh, I mean on the general evidence side, I mean nothing 
  really specific I we made some approaches in the past around sort 
  of different visual representations, but I would say nothing very 
  mature enough to really more discussion right now.
<kimhd> We can get into that later one do you have anything.
<juan_caballero> i'm not sure I understood the question is that 
  was the question about linking to external files in the evidence 
  document or was it more generally about ways of getting a visual 
  representation to travel with the vc.
<kerri_lemoie> Yes, I went when it was both it was.
<marty_reed> It was about embedding.
<kerri_lemoie> And data like we have an evidence property badges 
  and it was bad, including.
<kerri_lemoie> i'm not just a link where URL to the data but also 
  like embedding the evidence like an image, or something like 
  that, but also, I sort of parlayed that to.
<kerri_lemoie> embedding me see data into a file and with open 
  badges we also have this history of calling badge baking.
<kerri_lemoie> where you can like deliver a badge with data 
  inside of it which badge itself, right now, their images, but 
  sometimes they could be evidence right, so I I put them together, 
  but they are two separate things.
<> Okay.
<kerri_lemoie> um but yeah I would imagine like keeping vc size 
  small would would say it's probably not a great idea right now to 
  embed like photos and files into a vc.
<kerri_lemoie> Is that true.
<juan_caballero> yeah I think I think that's generally the 
  consensus.
<juan_caballero> I think that the issue with what what Marty 
  thing in the chat here like linking to an APP dfs location is.
<juan_caballero> pretty good if you can pin the I pfs and sort of 
  ensure the long term stability of that URL my my concern, always 
  with embedding links to static content is that you know the 
  signature breaks if that link breaks.
<juan_caballero> and
<juan_caballero> In terms of him bedding so there, there has been 
  a lot of talk about.
<juan_caballero> Other yeah other ways to keep visual visual 
  information it aligned sort of external to a vc there is some 
  weird stuff happening in depth with.
<juan_caballero> visual stuff being sort of a verify your side 
  maintained resource, but yeah sorry I maybe maybe go down rabbit 
  holes.
<kerri_lemoie> No okay it's great to hear your your understanding 
  of what's going on, this is about this.
<kerri_lemoie> i'll there's a lot of chat going on and then here 
  and I haven't been following along Kim if you're following along 
  you mind sort of like books in on this discussion.
<kimhd> yeah we basically we don't want to talk about this 
  anymore.
<kimhd> supposed to see no, no, no, no, no need to apologize to 
  just you know, trying to keep things back to the original let's 
  see so.
<kimhd> Anthony can I call on you, because um let's see we had an 
  agenda focused on open bad structure, plus.
<anthony_camilleri> years or so.
<anthony_camilleri> Because i'd like to make sure that we deal 
  with carrie slides and that we closed them today ah so.
<anthony_camilleri> First of all, okay Would you mind explaining 
  the slides back up it's a lot easier when I know it's challenging 
  critical monitor so let's go back to the slide with the 
  credential subject structure festival.
<anthony_camilleri> So.
<anthony_camilleri> let's, so I think the question to the group, 
  this is yes, so if we're looking at under the credentials subject 
  and the way that has been proposed to move batch class on the 
  credential from tech.
<anthony_camilleri> um does anybody have any comments on this 
  other does anyone have a issues they think that this could create 
  or problems, or do we think that this would actually be quite a 
  good way to move forward in terms of a vc is an open batch let's 
  start there.
<anthony_camilleri> Go ahead king.
<kimhd> Yes, I lost a where was the QA keep that up because there 
  is a week where did the achievement type go i'm just not 
  remembering where that was.
<kerri_lemoie> A prayer this example, let me put it in the other.
<anthony_camilleri> example if that was going to be my second 
  question, then, just focus on the achievement type, if you 
  prefer, we can focus on each event type first.
<kerri_lemoie> I perseids in this example here so, so it is type 
  and then achievement type, this one is just a batch in this 
  example.
<kimhd> And maybe stay on the second so achievement types, so 
  this one is just usual eXtensible through Google json ld you get 
  to define what you mean by are you to like badges to find 
  somewhere in the context listed of i'm guessing.
<kerri_lemoie> Yes, so this is an open badge type of verifiable 
  credential.
<kerri_lemoie> Okay, and achievement type would be in the context 
  we're open badges be three.
<kimhd> Okay okay.
<kerri_lemoie> As part of a batch class.
<kimhd> Okay, great yeah this looks good but can you keep it here 
  okay great.
<anthony_camilleri> Okay, I see key from the killer.
<keith_kowal> yeah I just I mean I think there's a lot of 
  conversation before around this schema has credential I thought I 
  understood it, but then I guess when we talked about some of the 
  new.
<keith_kowal> What the spec was looking towards and I kind of 
  lost context, again, I mean, first of all.
<keith_kowal> It doesn't seem like this is normally how schemas 
  are represented in the specific the vc specification, I mean 
  normally there's a different block where you represent schema and 
  you provide a.
<keith_kowal> URL to it, but more importantly, I mean mostly it 
  within normally within vcs if you declare, you have a vc and your 
  subject the vc.
<keith_kowal> That you mean you basically are implicitly saying 
  that this person has this credential, so why would you even need 
  to reference this reference back to the schema.org has credential 
  thing.
<kerri_lemoie> that's an excellent question i'm going to refer a 
  different, it is still here because they can work on this a bit 
  before I got too involved as much as I am now me Would you mind.
<ottomomy> Taking a quick stab so first of all, the the usage of.
<ottomomy> The word schema here on the screen is not the same as 
  the usage of the schema to describe the stigma of this.
<ottomomy> Of this whole verifiable credential the schema here is 
  just a reference to the schema.org namespace.
<ottomomy> which contains the property has credential, and so the 
  credential example that you're looking at here makes one simple 
  couple couple claims makes it evidence claim and a credential has 
  credential claim.
<ottomomy> The host credential claim is sort of the meat and 
  potatoes of what we've been talking about in this group for the 
  last couple months, which is the idea that there is a defined 
  achievement and that the subject of this credential has that 
  achieved they have met the criteria of a.
<ottomomy> That has been defined by the credentials Creator, you 
  know it's a bundle of criteria educational opportunity, maybe an 
  image metadata it's all this this this define the thing like here 
  is a degree in computer science.
<ottomomy> A bachelor's of science, you know in computer science 
  separately that could be a defined the credential and we're 
  making the achieve the claim that.
<ottomomy> This credential subject has that thing, and so, if you 
  wanted to express, what is the schema of this credential.
<ottomomy> That would be what you're saying is that this is a 
  defined achievement credential where there is a has credential 
  relationships or at its core, and then the the properties of the 
  specific credential that this learner has.
<ottomomy> This is an example drawn from IMS open badges were 
  which has the vocabulary for all those different properties, 
  mostly drawn from the schema.org vocabulary, as well as the 
  humps.
<ottomomy> May I.
<keith_kowal> just say, like every vc that we issue today has 
  contents in a bit and we don't have this I mean we issue a 
  degrees we issued diplomas today as vcs using vc attributes per 
  the vc spec and we don't need to have this has credential thing 
  so.
<keith_kowal> If we're trying to align open badges to vcs, why do 
  we need this thing when it's to me it's no different it's a 
  different type of payload it's but you're trying to do the same 
  thing Oh, thank you Lee.
<ottomomy> And i'll make only one brief response when you go back 
  to the queue.
<ottomomy> That the generic concept of a defined achievement is 
  powerful and a defined achievement that has a different type and 
  has come in representation and ability to be serialized across.
<ottomomy> Many different types of that achievement is a powerful 
  concept, and so, if you had eight different schemas to represent 
  a different credential types, one being degree, one being.
<ottomomy> certificate, one being volunteer opportunity and all 
  these different things that have common attributes, such as 
  criteria.
<ottomomy> For completion and the notion that the the creator of 
  this thing is the entity that can confer this on you.
<ottomomy> If you did those all in different ways, then you've 
  got to build consumer software to handle all of those different 
  schemas whereas if you build all of these different use cases 
  with.
<ottomomy> One common defined credential schema that's pretty 
  powerful in terms of building an ecosystem, where it's affordable 
  to build consumer software.
<anthony_camilleri> Okay, thanks for being sort of I believe TIM 
  isn't.
<kimhd> Actually nate address what I was going to cover did we do 
  I see Eric on the queue up did we cover what eric's question was.
<eric_kuhn> uh no I was gonna ask, or is there, like a use case 
  document tying back to when these this open badge type of model 
  would be used like sister kp 12 buyer and.
<eric_kuhn> You know coursera life courses, you know what's the 
  It is this whole discussion tied back to a set of real world 
  examples that we discussed earlier that I missed.
<kerri_lemoie> Is K, I think that open badges or is a decade the 
  old spec that started at mozilla foundation and over the IMS 
  global in 2017 and.
<kerri_lemoie> It can be used for all of those books and to there 
  are like 10 years worth of use cases and samples, so we could 
  probably pull something up, but all of those you mentioned are 
  true, they are used for everything from you know after school 
  programs to.
<kerri_lemoie> Your recognizing courses to recognizing 
  certificate programs really runs the gamut and they read they 
  really are used to recognize one single type of achievement or 
  still that could happen like anywhere that you type.
<kerri_lemoie> Two is very broad, in education, occupational 
  applications.
<eric_kuhn> I see So the idea here is that we get this sort of 
  nomenclature right and then, if i'm a student in the fifth grade 
  graduating, then I would get one of these for that achievement.
<eric_kuhn> If i'm completing a course in college I would get one 
  of these, or if I completed a course on Microsoft learn i've get 
  you know, a vc with this type of data object that.
<eric_kuhn> That outlines what this achievement is and like that 
  that whole system is based on what we're talking about now, or is 
  there a big looming feel our type of other spec that we're not 
  talking about now that totally changes what I just spent in.
<kerri_lemoie> that's right, so what we're talking about see I 
  don't even see, I have highlighted inside here is the IMS global 
  open badges specification that describes when issue.
<kerri_lemoie> And let's do our specification is a separate 
  specification but open badges can be inside of a car as a single 
  achievement that are listed in a car.
<eric_kuhn> Okay, and a car would be its own BC that's like a 
  single vc with lots of different achievements line item.
<kerri_lemoie> I tested excess that's it that's a potential 
  possibility.
<eric_kuhn> Okay.
<anthony_camilleri> And maybe this is a good time to take.
<anthony_camilleri> My own spot on the tool.
<anthony_camilleri> First of all.
<anthony_camilleri> I would like to just reinforce what an eight 
  sets about the achievement type in the sense that understanding 
  what the has credential is actually representing has.
<anthony_camilleri> Gone on use cases all afternoon it's it's a 
  very, very, very useful feature because it allows us to explain 
  it, this is a badge if it's an assessment it's an entitlement.
<anthony_camilleri> And as we move further along it would also 
  allow us to relate these concepts to each other and maybe we 
  wouldn't necessarily wants to let's say specify the relations 
  ourselves but it opens up those possibilities.
<anthony_camilleri> To answer a little bit more, the question on 
  whereas this asked for more specifically in the use cases and 
  the, why are we focusing on this, and the reason we're doing this 
  is.
<anthony_camilleri> What firstly as Kerry said, I mean open 
  badges is a it's an established standard, it has a very strong.
<anthony_camilleri> Open Source Community behind it and you know 
  you can't do anything in this space without treating open badges 
  but secondly open badges have the lovely feature that they are 
  relatively simple so starting with an open badge and figuring out 
  what an open badge could look like.
<anthony_camilleri> is a good way to move the discussions forward 
  about what a basic verifiable credential for education moves 
  forward.
<anthony_camilleri> In the meantime mighty group has started to 
  work on the complex credentials and is trying to figure out, then 
  how let's say these things would work with more complex 
  descriptions.
<anthony_camilleri> Of the basis of this work and will slowly 
  begin to bring this back to the main group for once we finalize 
  the open bachelor.
<anthony_camilleri> So I just wanted to let say remind of this 
  approach because let's say there's a logic there all the building 
  it in in this way and isn't really about.
<anthony_camilleri> The preferring open badges, but it really is 
  a matter that would say open badges being so foundational also 
  give us a good foundation to move the world forward.
<kerri_lemoie> As well said, thank you very much, I can see the 
  queue so someone could let me know who the next.
<anthony_camilleri> Keith why don't you just beat your comment 
  it's a lot easier, I think.
<keith_kowal> Well, I think I totally get the the need for 
  achievement types and I, and I echo that.
<keith_kowal> ability to group badges but I guess the question 
  i've been why don't we use the the type fields provided within 
  vcs because I think that would you know so.
<keith_kowal> You could you can, in the context you could have a 
  listing of types and then you could actually list out the type of 
  credential in a type field.
<keith_kowal> And then you know that would make it much easier 
  for standard like presentation exchange to consume that type 
  right, because I think.
<keith_kowal> You know presentation exchange and the input 
  descriptor allows you to specify well it's pretty open, but it 
  makes a lot of sense that you would put type in there, I think 
  some companies are already doing it that way, instead of schema.
<keith_kowal> So why not, why not move more towards a tight 
  construct instead of this has credential achievement construct 
  which still seems like something new to me like no i'm not really 
  seen before, where I have seen pipes before.
<anthony_camilleri> May I call on needs to answer that because I 
  believe you have already answered this in the chat.
<anthony_camilleri> Or if nate isn't available, maybe carrie 
  could go.
<kimhd> nate seems to be unmuted I think.
<kimhd> That we should carry as well.
<anthony_camilleri> Okay, the comments that was written was that.
<anthony_camilleri> i'm not sure which way around it is but 
  that's one of the i'm trying to find it in the chat history but 
  uh pair one of the concepts only supports IRI is, while the other 
  one supports references to formalize to 40 tables with the onset 
  of the nate has written earlier.
<kerri_lemoie> I don't know if I can speak to let me quote about 
  that i'm sorry.
<ottomomy> Sorry guys i'm on vacation and I was.
<ottomomy> Making coffee and breakfast on what I was mentioning 
  is that achievement type is a specific term that originated in 
  IMS global car.
<ottomomy> And that term expects a string and there is a 
  particular defined vocabulary ncr it's likely that open badges 
  will sort of pick that up kind of as is it's an optional 
  property.
<ottomomy> And the overall concept of credential type is also a 
  useful concept but, again, we have this idea of a.
<ottomomy> sort of reusable defined credential structure where 
  there are several different types of credential that can use the 
  same schema and how that gives us benefits for cost of 
  implementation.
<ottomomy> And sure yeah we make great sense if you wanted to put 
  it in the type property and may, and so you know I am so i'll 
  have a conversation about this in the open badges work urban 
  maybe when the achievement type.
<ottomomy> feature is discussed, maybe, people will say, well, 
  now that we're here in a world of a verifiable credentials, it 
  makes more sense to just have three types and.
<ottomomy> credential type and will do verifiable credential then 
  open badge then some other IRI for the ultimate achievement Type 
  two layers down the schema over.
<ottomomy> we're defining the relationship here between the the 
  credential definition and what its type is and the ability to be 
  able to express credentials of different types in the common 
  schema.
<ottomomy> I think that has a lot of benefits and i'm really 
  interested in exploring and building an ecosystem out around that 
  idea, so I see that there is a useful difference between the 
  credential type and achievement type.
<anthony_camilleri> nighttime not for that you've fully answered 
  the question because I think the I if i'm not mistaken, the 
  question is about having type and achievements type, both within 
  the has credential rather than.
<anthony_camilleri> Because, if you look at what's on screen 
  under ID we have tied.
<ottomomy> yeah ones and irin ones not.
<ottomomy> The difference that we start with.
<ottomomy> I mean it's just putting a term from car in the way 
  that car did it It may be that if this group advises the bad be 
  done a different way that.
<ottomomy> The open badges work group I mean we've got 
  representatives here on the call will hear it, and I think it It 
  certainly makes sense to maybe say oh OK, we can have an array of 
  types in the credential type property and the second one will 
  just be an IRI for the concept of batch.
<ottomomy> Totally reasonable.
<ottomomy> says in the chat it makes sense that there's a 
  technical type in a conceptual type and that those are not 
  completed there's an argument to be made that direction as well.
<kerri_lemoie> yeah These are all good points and it's the first 
  time we've actually really discussed talking about achievement 
  type with open badges specifically in this group to so it's great 
  to hear all of those perspectives.
<kerri_lemoie> Are there other folks in the queue right now.
<anthony_camilleri> Who is currently empty.
<kerri_lemoie> Okay Anthony did you have thoughts of where you 
  want to take it from here, we have about 10 minutes left.
<anthony_camilleri> I didn't have any particular thoughts.
<anthony_camilleri> Where where we wanted to take it.
<anthony_camilleri> Further from here, honestly, so I think he 
  either over to you, or we could open it for just general 
  comments.
<kerri_lemoie> yeah why don't we do that does anybody have any 
  general comments about this, as it stands.
<kerri_lemoie> i'll leave this up here for now.
<kerri_lemoie> Oh yeah.
<phil_barker> Can I jump in film.
<phil_barker> i've just got a question we.
<phil_barker> a while back, we spent quite a few.
<phil_barker> coins discussing sort of high level conceptual 
  things that might be covered by verifiable credentials.
<phil_barker> honing down on three in the end, which were.
<phil_barker> can't entirely remember but activities credentials 
  stroke, qualifications and a third one, which I think something 
  like affiliations, where do they fit into this type of not on 
  your where's the information that this is a.
<phil_barker> credential stroke qualification.
<kerri_lemoie> That Anthony percent from the cues and answer to 
  those questions.
<anthony_camilleri> Ah, well, I actually would.
<anthony_camilleri> be similar and they can answer it while at 
  it.
<anthony_camilleri> Oh.
<anthony_camilleri> Oh, under this model, these would be 
  different, what I pulled.
<anthony_camilleri> Different types here um.
<anthony_camilleri> I think when we finish all the work we might 
  need to go through the naming of things I really don't want to 
  facilitate naming of things right now.
<anthony_camilleri> But, to answer your question directly and 
  achievements type could describe an activity to describe an 
  entitlement you could describe the qualification I believe 
  there's some examples here um but my.
<anthony_camilleri> My other question which was really.
<anthony_camilleri> hairy is.
<anthony_camilleri> If you were going to go in this direction 
  with open badges what I have been wondering to myself allow that 
  is that yeah, what do you need the type called bad because.
<anthony_camilleri> in the sense that we would have saved this 
  new batch class structure that, especially if it included 
  achievement type of could be used to describe pretty much any 
  educational concepts.
<anthony_camilleri> And a badge isn't an educational concept per 
  se and badges own way of describing educational concepts unless 
  i'm getting very confused.
<anthony_camilleri> I would say, the whole thing is that I would 
  say the badge would contain one of all these other things now, I 
  say this from the position of not being an open badge expert, so 
  I might have some conceptual confusion over there, but would 
  appreciate it if you could clarify.
<kerri_lemoie> Sure um well this achievement.
<kerri_lemoie> Type comes from the car, so it is a property of 
  the car and this is so that if a badge is one of the achievements 
  in a car, it can be indicated as such.
<kerri_lemoie> And so we are proposing right now just just to 
  start this discussion at the working group to you know, use the 
  same properties that are already being used in a car.
<kerri_lemoie> i'm an overall the Anthony and open badge is both 
  a technology, but also a and a description of an achievement 
  right, so it is both at the same time.
<kerri_lemoie> But yes, this specific property, we would still 
  need that because it is needed in car and if we're using the same 
  properties and that's what decided on them we would keep that.
<kerri_lemoie> In the list and into in a way, I think, actually 
  would be great if we kept it in the same we do do it this way is 
  others said because.
<kerri_lemoie> If I have in my verified presentation, or just 
  like generally in the world, I have a vc that is a badge, but I 
  also have a vc that is.
<kerri_lemoie> A potential that could be a difference between the 
  two, and what I don't see on this list for sealer, though, is.
<kerri_lemoie> Is micro credential and and i've noticed over the 
  year so there's been what I think, in my opinion, is a conflation 
  between open badges and micro credentials and this assumption 
  that every open badge isn't maker credential.
<kerri_lemoie> which I don't think that's true my potential is 
  its own type of credential that can be represented by an open 
  badge so that opens up a whole philosophical discussion that 
  probably goes beyond assessing some of the specifics here.
<anthony_camilleri> um okay so um.
<anthony_camilleri> i'm next on the cube I will only take one 
  sentence, because I see others with it um I from my personal 
  perspective, I very much support the idea of the achievement 
  type, but they would have significant reservations about taking 
  the cla list of achievement types, as even recommended.
<anthony_camilleri> We tried doing something with this list in 
  Europe, and it cost us nothing but pain and we gave up trying to 
  work with it, I could speak more at length and other time as to 
  the reasons of that.
<anthony_camilleri> I see.
<anthony_camilleri> On the queue that are there are comments from 
  Keith which I would urge you to say or a lead and I also see 
  Phillip on the cube, so I will put Philip on the queue first and 
  then Keith if you don't mind justify your chats verbally, I think 
  it will be a lot easier.
<phil-t3> yeah.
<phil-t3> I just wanted to point out that, in the context of 
  badging I think one of the reasons that has largely been.
<phil-t3> redefined, if you will, and colloquial use as a micro 
  credential is twofold one is that in doing the in doing so in the 
  academic world it moves it away from assertions that have credit 
  involves, which means a whole other round of.
<phil-t3> complicated.
<phil-t3> political discussions with institutions, because only 
  certain parts of institutions are are allowed to assign and award 
  credit, and so one of the reasons why that.
<phil-t3> Open badge to call in that caught that connotation was 
  to separate it from the things that typically are under the 
  control of the provost and a registrar so there's there's that 
  history that has to be.
<phil-t3> Considered in this, and the second is that the open 
  badge in one sense, was defined initially to be as.
<phil-t3> As applicable to the granularity of the issuer as they 
  wish, so you could define an open badge to be a very, very tiny 
  thing or an open badge to be a culmination of a several years 
  worth of work, because the badge itself had no other way of.
<phil-t3> of providing anything about the magnitude of the 
  achievement and the work that was involved in it.
<phil-t3> And, as a consequence that was both a plus and a minus 
  because it meant that people receiving the badges had no real 
  sense of Is this a big piece of work or to the person just show 
  up for class that day.
<phil-t3> versus, this is a PhD know leave it at that.
<anthony_camilleri> Okay, thank you very much, Philip i'm going 
  to pass the floor to Keith.
<keith_kowal> um yeah basis echo what I said I think i've been 
  talking with Kerry and others it's like you know.
<keith_kowal> So let's say we come up with this standard, you 
  know I think you know and we're interested in this, but we have 
  to build you know let's say P O co things like that, so we would 
  most likely use.
<keith_kowal> Common you know standards, as we see them 
  developing and you know, in the US, at least presentation 
  exchanges is emerging as the dominant standard for making proof 
  requests.
<keith_kowal> For these type of credentials, so I think my 
  question always come back to like.
<keith_kowal> How we're going to approach that like today proof 
  requests often ask for things like schemas or four types, which 
  is you know still out a lot of complexity about it, but now 
  we're.
<keith_kowal> adding another layer of complexity this concept of 
  achievement type and I can definitely see.
<keith_kowal> The us having a treatment types in the Europe 
  having achievement types and Australia having achievement types, 
  because no one can agree on what achievement types are what the 
  list should be.
<keith_kowal> I think it's just you're adding another layer into 
  complexity, for how to verify or would actually get this data and 
  I understand we're not like there's a lot of runway, we need to 
  figure out this stuff, but I think these are just some that 
  really questions to start maybe thinking about.
<anthony_camilleri> I see Kim on the cube can, I believe.
<anthony_camilleri> You will be next on the queue and also have 
  the honors of closing the meeting.
<kimhd> Okay, great.
<kimhd> yeah I would just have to Keith.
<kimhd> provide some specific structural examples of what he's 
  talking about is unfamiliar with the presentation change spec and 
  so you know, I think.
<kimhd> i'm not i'm not really seeing.
<kimhd> The comment about like how to say i'm not seeing how 
  anything that we're doing here precludes or makes presentation, a 
  change more difficult, I mean maybe if it's.
<kimhd> A certain interpretation that he's making that Keith 
  you're making about how it would be used in presentation I shane 
  show, I was wondering if you could just write up something to 
  show what you mean and we could, in fact.
<kimhd> Talk about that in the next meeting, or, if you want to 
  send it to the mailing list that would be good to.
<kimhd> Very also very interested in using these with 
  presentation, a change but i'm not really seeing the specific
