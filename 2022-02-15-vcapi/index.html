<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Orie Steele</span>:  Yeah which is again probably not well addressed on this particular poll request so I think conversation will continue on the pull request as long as it remains open but concrete change requests or approval should happen to the pull request and its current change set and we should probably limit our discussion on pull requests to the changes suggested and open issues if there&apos;s another. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Orie Steele</span>:  We want to keep the conversation focused on the changes that are suggested not conversations about the entire ecosystem. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  Yeah so I raised a concern on this one just because on the last call I heard an unanswered question from Brian as to why we were at the time I think last week it was just focused on uuid and now it&apos;s been expanded to something else so I want to make it clear that I&apos;m not opposed to having a clear definition of what the transaction ID should be we should just wrap in Logic for. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  Or decision process for making that choice so that it&apos;s clear to people coming to the API why that decision is made and is the way it is so it&apos;s more of an opportunity for those who who might have a reason to have a different type of transaction ID or have different plans for this transaction ID that don&apos;t currently fit in within the multi base encoding or the uuid format but it&apos;s an open window as far as I&apos;m concerned but I&apos;m ready to close. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  You know we&apos;ve decided on on this format for a session ID for the following good reasons or you articulated them with your owasp you know input validation post so I&apos;m good anybody else. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Pretty much the same from from me I don&apos;t feel strongly about it so I&apos;m also find leaving it the way it is I just thought that if transaction ID supposed to be opaque to the client right it doesn&apos;t mean anything to a client and on the server side different implementations may use that in different ways sometimes it might be a uuid sometimes it may be a sequential number and sometimes sometimes the server side image. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;mprorock&gt; there are cases where a client might use that - e.g. get me a list of my transactions from last 30 days, then let me get the details of one specific one</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Should identifiers to encode state in the identifier itself right in some kind of format that we may not yet be be aware of and yeah but I also understood or is comments about potential attack vectors this this opens up so I also just have a 1230 chelate this as a common without really having a strong opinion in a hurry. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Okay yeah I mean this is good this is useful to get down in the transcription and so that we can refer to it later I think what we&apos;re saying is we&apos;re saying presently the only number you know the only thing that we seem to be considering is just a uuid or some 128-bit value to identify the transaction ID it&apos;s meaningful for the server. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Not necessarily it&apos;s not meaningful at all to the client it&apos;s opaque to the client and what we&apos;re trying to do is we&apos;re not trying to create kind of an arbitrary field where you can just encode just about anything in it we&apos;re saying for now we are very specifically restricting it to different representations of 128-bit numbers and in the future if we find a use case or a reason. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Kind of the the allowable alphabet to be larger or more diverse we can open that up later on so we&apos;re starting very strict and very narrow and in the future if we find out that there are other reasons to make it less narrow we can open up the aperture at that point does that feel like a logical stance for us to take at this point and then. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-66').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-66').show()" id="66" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  Open world or interpretation it can actually lead to a lack of interoperability because you know a very specific parameter you know as required by the server but you know the client doesn&apos;t support it even though they think they&apos;re they&apos;re speaking the same you know message structure so I think the this particular proposal on how a client can find out what the endpoints mean and maybe those. <a id="link-66" style="display:none;" href="#66">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-78').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-78').show()" id="78" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  They&apos;re using on that does Discovery so I&apos;m just raising the question of like who&apos;s who exactly is going to use this and for what use case so that&apos;s the first question the second kind of note is that with so for example with credential refresh the discovery mechanism is in the verifiable credential itself you issue a verifiable credential you give it to someone in they discover what the exchange endpoint is. <a id="link-78" style="display:none;" href="#78">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-79').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-79').show()" id="79" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In the verifiable credential itself so it&apos;s not post you know it&apos;s not done through a get to the server it&apos;s a it&apos;s a piece of data that you get and you carry around with you so that&apos;s another approach for you know discovery that I that I know we&apos;re going to be that isn&apos;t you know it&apos;s going to be implemented right so I&apos;m wondering who&apos;s got the use cases that are going to do a get here and then. <a id="link-79" style="display:none;" href="#79">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-82').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-82').show()" id="82" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  Yeah thanks so I wanted to Echo your your let&apos;s not reinvent soap comment was well I think that that&apos;s an excellent example of where Discovery got you know almost out of control and clients had to be you know so when you know deeply developed in order to accommodate all the the open world you know API discovery that it became just kind of quite difficult so the suggestion here is not to re you know. <a id="link-82" style="display:none;" href="#82">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-85').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-85').show()" id="85" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  From that the use case is I think there needs to be some context around the exchange ID for example I have credential refresh in in that example that&apos;s just a string that that I could say credential refresh or credential refresher or credential refresh to what protocol is the client expected to engage with at that end point and to your. <a id="link-85" style="display:none;" href="#85">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-86').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-86').show()" id="86" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  In the credential itself for credential refresh their I think with service endpoints and you know there&apos;s a type field I think we are close to to having a mechanism for communicating how you know a client is supposed to communicate to that you know URL path but and I think it should be tightly controlled in that way so that it doesn&apos;t become just you know. <a id="link-86" style="display:none;" href="#86">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-87').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-87').show()" id="87" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  Discovery so maybe you know I do have a yam will file their the expectation is not necessarily that the client is going to build a compliant you know Epi on the fly but it should at least recognize the string and it know and you know as a developer you know where to go find the spec related to how to actually communicate with this endpoint and and I&apos;ll just point out that I think I&apos;ve seen a couple variations on this endpoint already in different PR and I apologize I don&apos;t have. <a id="link-87" style="display:none;" href="#87">✪</a></div>
