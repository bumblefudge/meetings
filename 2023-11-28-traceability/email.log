Benjamin Collins is scribing.
Nis Jespersen :  I have made improvements since last week. 
  Waiting for approval from Tod. I want GS1 to look at it.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/pull/605
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  This is opened Russel, who is not here 
  today. Can anyone speak on this?
Chris Abernethy:  I think we decided onsd-jwt and json-ld which 
  we agree on.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  I think that was the case too, so I'm 
  looking at what's pending.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/pull/909
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Let's move over to tace-vocab. we'll start 
  with the merge-first one.
Nis Jespersen :  This adds a lot of formats on id's and dates in 
  general. and it makes a lot of changes all over the place.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  It changes multimodal blll of lading to 
  datetime. It defines the format but not the type, is that 
  intentional?
https://opis.io/json-schema/2.x/formats.html#:~:text=invalid-,date%2Dtime,%3A%3ADDThh%3Amm%3Ass.
YYYY:MM::DDThh:mm:ss.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: YYYY:MM::DDThh:mm:ss. sTZD
Nis Jespersen : 2017-07-21T17:32:28Z
<chris_abernethy> "date-time. A string is valid against this 
  format if it represents a date-time in the following format: 
  YYYY:MM::DDThh:mm:ss. sTZD"
<chris_abernethy> lol
Nis Jespersen : https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> Jitsi does 
  that smiley change... IRC does the right thing.
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> quick check 
  of backticking `YYYY:MM::DDThh:mm:ss`
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> nope
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/pull/911
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  We'll go ahead and merge
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/pull/906
Nis Jespersen :  This one adds country as a type. And Ted has a 
  few wording changes.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/pull/907
Nis Jespersen :  Packing list is an important credential in terms 
  of international transport. It hasn't been in super great shape, 
  so I inlined it, and aligned it with consignment item the Cfact 
  term.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/pull/910
Nis Jespersen :  The digital passport schema is still evolving. I 
  believe that we will need a way to link upstream in the supply 
  chain. I think there will still be changes.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  How long have we had this?
Nis Jespersen :  I added this about a month ago?
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Is this a digital twin of the product?
Nis Jespersen :  It's a european commission legislation coming on 
  the horizon. They're going to roll it out on batteries and then 
  tectile and then all products. It's to promote reduce, reuse, 
  repair, evt.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  This is a link, is there also a digital 
  product passport schema?
Nis Jespersen :  I'm not sure what you mean?
Benjamin Collins:  I think it's before when we separated out the 
  credential schema.
Nis Jespersen :  No, this is being defined inline. So I just 
  defined it inline in this case.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Can you create an issue to make sure we have 
  a class for this?
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/pull/911
Nis Jespersen :  This is expanding the licensing model that we 
  have. This is when you lease out your IPR for others to 
  manufacturer or market.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Have you seen this in use?
Nis Jespersen :  In real-world, but not in credentials.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  This sounds like a new use-case.
Nis Jespersen :  This is part of the eCommerce segment of the 
  vocab.
