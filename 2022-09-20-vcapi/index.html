<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Deepak was this concept of streamlining the data Integrity specification so the reason that it has an effect on some of the VC API stuff is that when it comes to testing the VC API as some of you that are new here we have this test Suite that test various aspects of the be Capi issuing verifying things like credential status. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  And of course we had to settle on some kind of did to run the test Suites under and that&apos;s did key right now so all the tests weeds that do signatures and everything is did key for testing the streamlining data Integrity work is about effectively standardizing doing doing the global standard for the data Integrity mechanism of securing verifiable. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Which is one of the mechanisms and we&apos;re trying to lock it in basically So within the next let&apos;s say nine months probably closer to six months we will have the data Integrity specs locked in such that people can start committing to certain cryptography Suites long-term like five plus years you know long-term kind of support for. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yes that was yeah excellent point Muhammad they were really two decisions that need to be made and we can make those decisions independently of one another and at no point are we going to lose backwards compatibility like you can still do the old stuff this was just a proposal for us being able to make it easier for some of the new stuff. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): Yeah I can just maybe voice what I&apos;m thinking like so for me yeah just like this like a right to bit confusing and that&apos;s my first reaction but I just want to make sure I understand so the from what I understood the last time the goal was to have individual test suite for each cryptographic methods so is that still going to be the way the tests are going to be driven except there will be more tests. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): The sort of proof being outside of the context and the other one to prove being sort of included or embedded under contact so those would be two separate tests. <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Um so there will still be one test Suite / crypto sweet so if you&apos;re using like e.t. to 5519 signature 2020 there&apos;s a separate test suite for that the new stuff is going to be called like EDSA 2020 or BBS 2020 or ecdsa 2020 sorry 2022 those new. <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-54').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-54').show()" id="54" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The sweet so they will always be this one-to-one mapping between test suite and Krypton sweet and that won&apos;t change what what you said was slightly nuanced there&apos;s a slightly nuanced difference there the group has not made a decision on whether or not to include this new it&apos;s called it data Integrity proof type like if they include that in the base verifiable credential version 2 context. <a id="link-54" style="display:none;" href="#54">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-55').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-55').show()" id="55" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Has to include new crypto sweets as far as they follow you know that General design pattern but that decision hasn&apos;t been made yet so the we expect the test Suite might change if we were testing verifiable credentials so either you&apos;re going to need a new data integrity. <a id="link-55" style="display:none;" href="#55">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-185').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-185').show()" id="185" class="information">Paul_Dietrich_GS1: Yeah just a comment on nomenclature money I think that right now as a newcomer I see this BC apis and API and the VCA API test Suite is a test suite for that API but now what you&apos;re proposing is that this DC API is the API for a test suite and so like the nomenclature here for me gets pretty confusing and it makes me like question again we&apos;ll what is this API is it a test Suite or is it an API that&apos;s in production or is you know what I&apos;m saying. <a id="link-185" style="display:none;" href="#185">✪</a></div>
