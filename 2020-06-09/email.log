Orie Steele:  Spec and demo links above [scribe assist by Chris 
  Winczewski]
Chris Winczewski: ... Would like to speak for a bit and then open 
  up for questions
Chris Winczewski: ... A number of demos are used and all of them 
  use various services (e.g. key storage)
Chris Winczewski: ... Interoperable wallets inevitably come up
Chris Winczewski: ... The goal is to create a data model and 
  abstract interface for wallets
Chris Winczewski: ... Trying to create a data model that accounts 
  for how these identifiers, currencies, etc are all related
Chris Winczewski: ... And how to abstract for interop
Chris Winczewski: ... Data cannot be moved from one system to 
  another is we don't have a common data model
Chris Winczewski: ... Reference implementation for one use case 
  to show how this would work
Chris Winczewski: ... Trying to build a vocabulary vs creating 
  new and potentially duplicate data models

Christopher Allen: https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research
Christopher Allen:  Some Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet providers 
  trying at the base level (e.g. what is a seed) to come to 
  agreement [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Christopher Allen: 
  https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/whats-wallet.md
Chris Winczewski: ... Could the community, or DIF tackle some of 
  the naming issues? RWOT link above for What is a Wallet?
Orie Steele: DIF did tackle glossary terminology a little while 
  ago... not sure if there is a link that can be entered for future 
  readers.
Chris Winczewski: ... Arrows within these models also need to be 
  named
Chris Winczewski: ... Starting small with vocabulary. Tech 
  interop (e.g. CBOR) will come later
Joe Andrieu:  Where to you see this going from here Orie? [scribe 
  assist by Chris Winczewski]
Orie Steele:  Trying to gather interest from CCG and DIF to 
  support this initiative [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Margo Johnson: Re: Orie's comment about DIF glossary work, here 
  is that presentation from recent work include wallet, credential, 
  agent ecosystem analysis

Christopher Allen: I'd like to see this diagram updated: 
  https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/media/ExpandedDecentralizedIdentityNetworkComponents.png
Chris Winczewski: ... If there is support then let's come 
  together. Supporting a work item is preferred.
Wayne Vaughn:  This is a wallet interoperability initiative? 
  [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Orie Steele:  Yes, import/export representations for wallets to 
  be used together [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Wayne Vaughn:  Naming topic, could we modify the name "Universal 
  Wallet?" [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Chris Winczewski: ... What about porting key pairs from one 
  wallet to another
Brent Zundel: This may be valuable information for a way that 
  part of the community thinks about wallets: 
  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0050-wallets
Orie Steele:  Moving keys is a risk but it is a thing that the 
  community does now. Vocabulary can help clarify what moving keys 
  means and what the risks are. [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Christopher Allen:  When developing the BTCR wallet and the 
  underlying BTC wallet, we learned a number of things (e.g. Air 
  Gap) [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Chris Winczewski: ... The diagram is missing a number of pieces 
  such as Shamir and revocation
Brent Zundel: Also related: 
  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0051-dkms
Orie Steele: Its definitely a hard problem... thats why we are 
  tackling it :)
Chris Winczewski: ... It turns out this is a difficult problem 
  across all of the crypto wallet families. We don't have 
  representation from these groups here as well.
Orie Steele: I have opened this issue targeting hyperledger 
  interoperability: 
  https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet/issues/9
Chris Winczewski: ... Need group to agree so we don't do the work 
  but then everyone just continues with their own wallet
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Support from the educational credential side 
  as there are currently a lot of wallets in the wild [scribe 
  assist by Chris Winczewski]
Orie Steele: An we get a link to ILR wrapper?
Chris Winczewski: ... ILR, which is a type of VC, is focused on 
  discoverability
Joe Andrieu: I don't know if the ILR paper is published yet
Chris Winczewski: ... There will be interest to integrate with a 
  number of identity providers
Chris Winczewski: ... Possibly take this on in the VC EDU 
  Taskforce
Chris Winczewski: ... Usability for the learner is also critical, 
  since the wallet is usually the entry point into this tech
Orie Steele: Here is another UI demo which attempts to expose 
  some usable UX for this:

Margo Johnson: Re: Orie's comment about DIF glossary work, here 
  is that presentation from recent work include wallet, credential, 
  agent ecosystem analysis

Joe Andrieu:  Margo and Brent added links for parts of the 
  conversation above [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Chris Winczewski: ... ILR was light on wallet. This Transmute 
  spec is very helpful to go deeper
Chris Winczewski: ... About webkms; the spec mentions this. Can 
  you speak to how webkms fits in?
Orie Steele:  Bottom line, don't move private keys if you do not 
  need to. Generate keys on the device and authorize them [scribe 
  assist by Chris Winczewski]
Chris Winczewski: ... Webkms is meant to hold keys behind a web 
  interface
Chris Winczewski: ... Keys mentioned in a wallet could be present 
  in a secure enclave or other method such as webkms.
Joe Andrieu:  Similarity to Bitcoin. Wallets do not hold your 
  Bitcoins [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Christopher Allen: 
  https://github.com/blockchainCommons/bc-lethekit
Christopher Allen:  We are increasingly finding that we want to 
  use device differences to separate private keys. For example, 
  link provided. [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Have to hop off but +1 to supporting edu spec and/or wg. 
  Interested in delineating crypto and edu wallet, which is perhaps 
  counter to “universal”
+Present
Chris Winczewski: ... The master key is never on the device which 
  is on the network
Christopher Allen: 
  Ur:crypto-hdkey/5vql2q6cyyqw3uewwg77eaq9rth6er3vj0yutvs5xyup0ndsrg2ffwgheppkkdgytqsgw00ls8qz75jky073legk06kr54dqf80r6v2tkshwyflla5ma2zqwu4mr8
Chris Winczewski: ... Network device is separate from the storage 
  device. This doesn't work for all use cases but should be 
  considered
Chris Winczewski: ... CBOR example which is optimized for QR 
  codes
Chris Winczewski: ... Wyoming laws with regards to private keys - 
  Stockholders can now be represented by keys. Corporate records 
  can now be stored on chain.
Chris Winczewski: ... May also add capability for the Secretary 
  of State to issue civic records
Chris Winczewski: ... A bill which protects private keys from 
  compelled disclosure also introduced. Should be taken up in next 
  legislative session.
Joe Andrieu:  For keys to perform their magic, they need to be 
  kept private [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Christopher Allen: This is the private key bill in Wyoming: 
  https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2020/HB0041
Orie Steele:  A note about the bar we are trying to meet. Indy 
  credentials format for example needs to be included [scribe 
  assist by Chris Winczewski]
Chris Winczewski: ... Software implementers and standards groups 
  need strong collaboration from the separate groups
Chris Winczewski: ... If you represent a community that you feel 
  is not well represented, please reach out
Christopher Allen:  There are a lot of assumptions in crypto 
  currency wallets that make some assumptions that can cause 
  problems [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Chris Winczewski: ... For example, automated account creation vs 
  answering a request from the netwok
Chris Winczewski: S/netwok/network
Orie Steele: +1 To the value of reference implementations
Orie Steele: Especially multiple ones in different languages
Chris Winczewski: ... Some things are only discovered when 
  implementing
Jonathan Holt:  Caution to separate key management from wallet 
  management [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Christopher Allen: +1 I think there is a lot of collisions here
Christopher Allen: I also want to separate keys from accounts 
  from wallets
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I'd be interested in helping untangle 
  key/credential management. The EDU use cases will force that 
  along
Chris Winczewski: ... Could be problematic for example, 
  associating keys to the correct accounts within the wallet
Christopher Allen: Keys, accounts, credentials, wallet
Orie Steele:  Great point, it is easy to destroy privacy 
  unintentionally [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Chris Winczewski: ... Future state could be that the wallet warns 
  you of these scenarios with key association and disclosure risks
Chris Winczewski: ... Adversary builds off what they can see so 
  the motivation behind the metadata is to balance this
Wayne Vaughn:  Has there been investigation into DPKI and KERI? 
  [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Orie Steele:  If you have a kms now, you would represent that in 
  a JSON data model. Not intended to commingle separate kms tools 
  [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Orie Steele: We support HD Keys
Joe Andrieu: Please type +1 HD key if you do, or plan to, support 
  HD keys in your wallet
Christopher Allen:  Do your tools plan to support HD Keys? Type 
  +1 in chat if you are. [scribe assist by Chris Winczewski]
Chris Winczewski: +1
Orie Steele: But for secp256k1 only
Jonathan Holt: Is HD in 25519 a thing yet?
Orie Steele: Is it secure? ... jury is out...
Chris Winczewski: ... Yes in 25519 but it is a challenge
