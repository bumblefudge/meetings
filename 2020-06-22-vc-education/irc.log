[2020-06-22T15:11:29.580Z]	<kimhd>	Topic: GC Talent Cloud
[2020-06-22T15:11:45.102Z]	<kimhd>	Scribe: MattLisle
[2020-06-22T15:12:25.188Z]	<MattLisle>	Val/David: discoverability of talent and skill recognition... focused on federal public service
[2020-06-22T15:13:34.133Z]	<MattLisle>	Val/David: current HR is too focused on formal creds... data is disconnected... no way to show real-time KSAs
[2020-06-22T15:16:21.587Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: worker signals of KSA that is credible and trusted... Canada rise of gig economy - gov't spending billions to recruit/hire talent, can be improved... "more than my job title"
[2020-06-22T15:18:00.134Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: Talent Cloud a grassroots effort... pilot live in 10/18. talent repository for project-based work
[2020-06-22T15:18:52.622Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: Talent Cloud is public sector "gig marketplace"... skills/credential recognition engine for employment
[2020-06-22T15:20:04.178Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: TC - first openbadges pilot for Canada gov't... also blockcerts pilot. Involved with T3 network.
[2020-06-22T15:23:24.888Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: differentiators - takes too long to onboard staff... get good talent in faster... more data for better matching between manager/worker... diversity/inclusion (more later)... promoting remote work by default... skills/competneices credential recognition
[2020-06-22T15:26:30.892Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: skills profile for workers... tools for recruiting/hiring for managers and HR... onset of COVID: repurpose tools to find matches for critical roles/skills... developing indigenous talent portal - indigenous people create profile, identify skills, by and for indigenous people
[2020-06-22T15:27:41.376Z]	<Joshua_Marks>	Q
[2020-06-22T15:27:54.428Z]	<kimhd>	q+ Joshua_Marks
[2020-06-22T15:28:34.563Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: TC Skills Architecture... comes out of much research on future of skills studies... TC included in their skills database... being part of open skill ecosystem, want to connect to bigger space
[2020-06-22T15:29:59.188Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: Current state... data from those who go through hiring process, but not hired, are lost. not tracking skills data through interviews, assessments, etc. missed opportunity.
[2020-06-22T15:31:24.198Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: process map for verifiable skill assessment records... person creates profile, claim skills (work, personal, education, etc), application is assessed, once candidate passes assessment it triggers record and goes into profile... added to profile/wallet and reused for other applications/jobs
[2020-06-22T15:33:28.818Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: working with private sector, not-for-profit, academia, public sector... end of high level overview of TC. now overview of UX/UI work
[2020-06-22T15:34:32.262Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: walkthrough of process between applicant claiming skill, hiring manager verifying skill, adding that skill to applicant record
[2020-06-22T15:35:55.328Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: demo... worker claims a skill (design research). opportunity to tap into open taxonomies/ontologies to speak same language as others. worker claims level of skill, evidence, etc.
[2020-06-22T15:36:48.589Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: manager sees claim from worker... invited worker to assessment... takes notes during assessment (e.g. written exam)... creates assessment record
[2020-06-22T15:37:17.389Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: back to candidate... has captured all data from process in their profile and can reuse in the future.
[2020-06-22T15:37:31.471Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: demo of verifiable credentials skills prototype from David...

[2020-06-22T15:39:30.577Z]	<MattLisle>	David: user profile page... merge web app with world of decentralized data and wallet. using open libraries... user chooses "create skill"
[2020-06-22T15:40:16.829Z]	<MattLisle>	David: skill on worker profile... mangaer now has "verify" button... click it, skill becomes VC...
[2020-06-22T15:42:15.735Z]	<MattLisle>	David: user presents credential from wallet... (hope to support multiple wallets)... select credential... credential handler api to store credential to wallet
[2020-06-22T15:43:36.840Z]	<MattLisle>	David: going forward... interest in relevant UX studies... merging centralized and decentralized worlds... they want to remain open source, but able to integrate... looking for most suitable and highest quality libraries and staying connected with community

[2020-06-22T15:45:58.303Z]	<Simone_Ravaioli>	congrats, Val and David awesome work !
[2020-06-22T15:46:11.808Z]	<MattLisle>	Joshua_Marks: skill architecture question... interested in transferable skills... where are they formatted and how can we crosswalk/integrate? implmenting CASE or other standards?
[2020-06-22T15:47:34.842Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: trying reach out into different communities... met with CAS (?)... looking to structure data to become interoperable... to date, been ad-hoc... but hoping to connect with bigger broader systems.
[2020-06-22T15:48:09.809Z]	<David_Mason>	CAS is CASS https://cassproject.org/
[2020-06-22T15:48:54.535Z]	<MattLisle>	David: correction CASS... CASS is a specification not a standard. recommendation from joshua_marks to focus on interoperable/crosswalk efforts
[2020-06-22T15:49:24.915Z]	<MattLisle>	Joshua_Marks: how picking assessment, particularly for transferable skills
[2020-06-22T15:49:41.215Z]	<Joshua_Marks>	https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/case
[2020-06-22T15:49:57.248Z]	<Joshua_Marks>	http://opensalt.org/
[2020-06-22T15:50:17.419Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: no perfect answer, they have a process where applicant applies for Canada gov't job... hiring manager has to have assessment process with rubric... TC creates tool to capture that data
[2020-06-22T15:52:21.236Z]	<MattLisle>	Val: no standardized assessments for every skill... hiring manager already building tools/rubrics, goal is to create a library of tools... also to help with documentation of assessment/hiring (data gets missed). collect data so it becomes part of record. another manager can trust it. won't solve ambiguity of assessment, but can reflect light on process that already exists.
[2020-06-22T15:54:03.008Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-06-22T15:54:33.650Z]	<MattLisle>	Joshua_Marks: suggestion... less about assessment, more about work task evaluations. Val: part of idea of dynamic record of worker/assessments
[2020-06-22T15:55:35.776Z]	<kimhd>	ack ottonomy
[2020-06-22T15:56:23.248Z]	<MattLisle>	ottonomy: ability accept VC from other systems/wallets... what is claims structure that you're accepting? what would external person who wants to recognize a skill, how would they get credential processed?
[2020-06-22T15:57:03.228Z]	<MattLisle>	ottonomy: asked if they'd seen the prototypes from VC for Edu for things like skill recognition?

[2020-06-22T15:58:17.343Z]	<MattLisle>	kimhd: david mentioned using many of same protocols that we're using in CCG... David's wallet screenshots use credential handler api, available through CCG.
[2020-06-22T15:59:13.828Z]	<MattLisle>	kimhd: good place to collaborate... exchanging protocols, data model of credentials, etc.
[2020-06-22T15:59:16.350Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-06-22T16:00:08.948Z]	<MattLisle>	kimhd: interested in further alignment work around taxonomies. would like to hear more about Joshua's work in Broward. on technical side, collaborating on protocols.
[2020-06-22T16:00:38.563Z]	<ottonomy>	Thanks @MattLisle for scribing
