So Sharon&apos;s here today to introduce an initiative with JFF and VC-EDU that encourages community participation and collaboration to help us move towards these goals and even though it&apos;s very early it&apos;s a good way to help us make progress on the topics that we have open now that we really wanted to move forward on. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Equitable opportunity for all and part of that is through jff Labs thinking about the ways that technology and investments in technology can accelerate some of that one of the things that we&apos;ve been thinking a lot about is the ways that individuals can represent themselves and their abilities and thinking about the various different ways that individuals learn and are given credit for the skills they have whether on the workplace or formerly at educational Institution. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
