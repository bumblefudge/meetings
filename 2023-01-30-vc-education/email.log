<kerri_lemoie> Hello all - we'll get started a little after 11.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> good day everyone!
<phil_l_(p1)> Morning VC-EDU community
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Kerri Lemoie:  Everyone happy Monday welcome to the January 30th 
  Verifiable Credentials for Education task force call today we are 
  going to have going to be talking about CHAPI - Manu Sporny is 
  here from Digital Bazaar and he's going to walk us through what 
  CHAPI is and how it works how it's been used so far he's got a 
  great presentation for us and then this is one of the topics I 
  types of topics we'd like to continue to cover.
Kerri Lemoie:  Edu because we know that everybody is trying to 
  understand how all of this works this is one of those calls 
  specifically so if you've never heard of CHAPI before this is 
  definitely the call for you and if you have heard of it I expect 
  you learn something new today too.
Kerri Lemoie:   Hey so to us.

Topic: IP Note

Kerri Lemoie:  Get us going here the first thing is the IP note 
  for w3c which is that if you are going to make any if you're 
  putting them in making any substitute contributions to any of the 
  standards then you should sign up to be a member and and join the 
  ccg this is just a community call so you don't need to do that 
  but if you need to do that the links are in the agenda that I put 
  in the chat.

Topic: Call Notes

Kerri Lemoie:   Call notes all of these calls.
Kerri Lemoie:  And we have a robot transcriber as you can see in 
  the left hand side and the chat and it does its best to 
  understand us and then we try to correct it as we go but that's 
  how we keep track of minutes for for these calls to the folks who 
  can't make it to the meetings can look this up later or any of us 
  could reference it later we use a cue system in these calls and 
  that means we type the letter Q like this in the chat like I'm 
  doing right now and I will add you to a queue and then if you.
Kerri Lemoie:   Want to be removed from the key you can type q-.
Kerri Lemoie:   And if you.
Kerri Lemoie:  To something directly that someone is hacking 
  about it's helpful to get you to go to q and then put in the 
  topic or whatever you'd like to say whatever it's in relation to 
  because then the person moderating the call on knows maybe when 
  to pull you into the order of the conversation okay.

Topic: Introductions & Reintroductions

Kerri Lemoie:  About 34 people here in the college or anyone here 
  today that would like to make an introduction and tell us more 
  about why they're here and what they're working on or 
  reintroduction even if you've been here before.

<manu_sporny> Demonstration of Support for EdDSA Cryptosuite 
  Adoption into VCWG: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/2023Jan/0027.html
Manu Sporny:  Thanks Gary um real quick announcement about 
  something happening in the verifiable credentials working group 
  this week we sent out a demonstration of support for the Edwards 
  curve crypto sweet this is this is this is one of the crypto 
  sweets that was used very heavily in the jmf plugfest to plugfest 
  there were over 20 companies that demonstrated interop there.
Manu Sporny:   There too.
Manu Sporny:  Official work item into the standards group we 
  needed to demonstrate kind of support for it and there's a letter 
  there with a lot of signatures on it many from you that went out 
  but the link I put into the chat Channel if you were not able to 
  get your name on that letter to support descriptive sweet as a 
  global standard just responding to that email is another way for 
  you to kind of show your support for the crypto sweet again this 
  this.
Manu Sporny:   Crypto Suite is.
Manu Sporny:  What we use to demonstrate interop in the the 
  plugfest to it is also the crypto sweet that is being pushed into 
  production across the u.s. for a number of retail use cases like 
  digital age verification so if you would like to see you know 
  this kryptos we'd become a global standard please send an email 
  you know demonstrating your support for that script is sweet.
Manu Sporny:  The first item second item is that the verifiable 
  credentials working group is having a face-to-face meeting in 
  Miami in about 14 days I think there are about what is it 
  something like 12 people in the 15 people attending in person 20 
  people total if you're not in the working group you can request a 
  be there as an observer you contact the chairs to do that.
Manu Sporny:   It will be a three day.
Manu Sporny:  In the middle of the week Tuesday Wednesday 
  Thursday that's it.
<kerri_lemoie> VC WG https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you manu I'll put a link to the VC working 
  group and the check two books and take a look at that.

Topic: Main Topic - Intro to CHAPI with Manu Sporny

Kerri Lemoie:  Hey our queue is empty I don't see any other 
  announcements or introductions but feel free to jump into the 
  queue and do that at any time during the call if something comes 
  to mind but first what we're going to do now is I like to do some 
  on you I was just speaking to give us a presentation and didn T 
  just about chappie which is a credential Handler API makes 
  monitors your coming here today to do this.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> @Jake - the resources are getting 
  posted on the T3 Network Hub today but if you send me an email, I 
  can forward ALL the resources from the kickoff event
Manu Sporny:  Of course always happy to thank you for the invite 
  let me go ahead and share my screen for those of you that I have 
  not met yet my name is Manu Spore knee I am the lead editor on 
  the verifiable credential specification the decentralized 
  identifier specification data integrity and a variety of other 
  kind of verifiable credential related specifications.
Manu Sporny:   Is that w3c.
Manu Sporny:  This work back in 2012 issue I think and it's great 
  to see it grow into what it is today so and and super awesome 
  that like the VC edu group exists and is so vibrant you know I 
  think these calls are now bigger than the main calls which is 
  which is really awesome to see that kind of traction in the 
  education space.
Manu Sporny:   Okay so.
Manu Sporny:  Talk about how how we move credentials around the 
  ecosystem so specifically how does somebody go to a website and 
  get a credential from that website into their digital wallet how 
  do they hold it in their digital wallet and manage it in their 
  digital wallet and then how do they then go to a totally 
  different website that wants a verifiable credential from them 
  and how did they deliver that.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> @Jake + all - Here is a link to 
  the Experience You [Public] project folder with the project paper 
  and call for participation and all the video recordings: 
  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qIDLscV4IgLdSc6zzRWCnK2MtMKaiwO-?usp=share_link
Manu Sporny:   Anshel to the other website this is just one 
  technique.
Manu Sporny:  That can do this the credential Handler API chappie 
  there are other technologies that will you know get into in a bit 
  but that's basically the gist of the talk today and it's meant to 
  be kind of like a high-level introduction please stop me as we go 
  I'll try and pause every couple of slides to ask if there are any 
  questions again you know this is meant to be a high level.
Manu Sporny:   All presentation so just highlight.
Manu Sporny:  Answer totally totally fine inappropriate okay so 
  let's let's get into it the.
<bob_sopko> I'm new to this meeting.  We are smarteduwallet.io.  
  Separately, I'm involved since the beginning with top level 
  domain www.secure.jobs.  www.linkedin.com/in/bobsopko
Manu Sporny:  Chappie stands for again the credential Handler API 
  it is kind of a browser-based technology to help us move 
  verifiable credentials around and this is the only picture that 
  you really need to understand to understand what chap he's doing 
  right what we have here on the left is verifiable credential 
  issuer like the university community college you know what have 
  you.
Manu Sporny:   And they're going to issue credentials into.
<greg_bernstein> Not seeing the slides?
Manu Sporny:  All it that is controlled by an individual a 
  student or a teacher or a professor of some kind and then they're 
  going to hold a digital credentials in that digital wallet and 
  then their going to move it to a verifier so a job hiring site an 
  employer of some kind another University it's on so forth and 
  this is basically kind of the.
<kerri_lemoie> Link to slides in case you can't see: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/166wxPer_d_xN9afCdAO7PGYrVGlKYXP0gLZSKlejOVE/edit#slide=id.ge9090756a_1_300
<phil_l_(p1)> Also not seeing the slide
Manu Sporny:  That you know is in verifiable credentials you've 
  got issuers if that holders and you've got verifiers chappie is 
  the thing that moves the credentials between these entities in 
  the ecosystem so these little purple boxes that you see with the 
  little arrows back and forth this type of communication this 
  channel of communication that's chappie so that is effectively 
  what we're talking about today thank you.
Manu Sporny:   For sharing the slides Kari can anyone else I 
  guess not.
Manu Sporny:  You know Philly okay all right.
Kerri Lemoie:  They are looking okay for me here so I think folks 
  who can't see might want to follow along in the Google Doc.
<jake> Thank you Colin
Manu Sporny:  Okay thanks okay so this is it like at a high level 
  this is it this is all there really is to chappie will dive down 
  into the details but like this is basically at a high level so 
  let me let me pause here are there any questions at a high level 
  about kind of what we're talking about here it's just a mechanism 
  to move credentials between the entities and in the verifiable 
  credentials ecosystem.
Kerri Lemoie:  Nothing so far
Manu Sporny:  Okay all right so what does chappie do chappie has 
  a couple of features in it and again Chappy's something that is 
  just there in your browser right it's something that does 
  something in your browser you as an individual really don't have 
  to think about it it's the developers that have to worry about it 
  and making sure that they included in their websites that you as 
  an individual just showing up to a website that's chappie.
Manu Sporny:   Able just get to start using it right so the.
<kerri_lemoie> Page 3 of slides
Manu Sporny:  That chappie does is it enables digital wallet 
  registration what that means is that we presume well we know that 
  they're going to be many different digital wallets in the world 
  in what we're trying to do with chappie is to make sure that 
  people have a choice in the digital wallets that they pick we 
  don't want large big Tech tip effectively in like push their 
  digital Wallets on people and not really give them a choice we 
  want individuals to find the digital wallet.
Manu Sporny:   Wallets that work best for them go to those 
  websites and then allow them to.
Manu Sporny:  Digital wallets with the web browser so this is the 
  first thing that chappie does is digital wallet registration on 
  the left here the animations probably better in if you look at 
  the slides life but the diagram on the left here is showing the 
  chappie dialogue that says hey this website this digital wallet 
  website would like to manage your credentials manage credentials 
  on your behalf is that okay with you yes no in this dialog works 
  very much.
Manu Sporny:   Much like allowing a website access to your 
  camera.
Manu Sporny:  Site access to your geolocation you're basically 
  saying I want this website to manage my digital credentials for 
  me right and you can click that button many times on many 
  different websites you can have many different digital wallets so 
  the image on the right here shows the chappie choose a wallet 
  dialogue in you will see multiple entries in here from multiple 
  different types of wallets so these are the wallets that we used 
  in the jmf plugfest you can see you know.
Manu Sporny:   This wallet learned.
Manu Sporny:  Charles laners wallet teacher wallet and just 
  another demo while it's so these are all wallets that have 
  registered with chappie so that when you go to do an operation 
  like storing a credential or presenting a credential you will get 
  an option to pick from among a number of different wallets so 
  that's the first thing that chappie does the first feature that 
  chappie has is it lets you register while it's so that.
Manu Sporny:   You can pick from them later on.
Manu Sporny:  Me pause there any questions on wallet 
  registration.
<utxodario> q Question - "Manage credentials" ... manage 
  particular creds or ALL creds ??
<pl> How does this get around the NASCAR problem?
Kerri Lemoie:  Money I have a few questions but I wanted to make 
  one clarification is that tell me if I'm wrong here but I think I 
  might is that if I would register my wallet so it's not on this 
  website it's just that I have this wallet and I would allow this 
  well at tiebacks you access to chappie playground.
Kerri Lemoie:   Okay I just.
Kerri Lemoie:  It doesn't go at a playground and see a list of 
  all it's instead they're all registered in the way like someone 
  personally so you this would be say your your choice of your 
  wallet that you're showing in the screenshot.
Manu Sporny:  Yes that's right it's personalized to you it is 
  your selection not the web site selection right so it's it's so 
  Kerry is going to have a different set of wallets from like what 
  I have in let's say that Phil is going to have a different set of 
  wallets then me so this dialogue is basically showing you your 
  wallets the ones that you prefer not the ones that the website 
  prefers.
Manu Sporny:   Dimitri I see you're here on the queue.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To could carry these into it I wanted to 
  clarify that as well when we say register with chappie we don't 
  mean register with Chad be like the organization or anything like 
  that it's each wallet registers with each browser and in fact 
  with the combination of user browser so when when Manu and Terry 
  say that it's it's your list so when you first go to any website.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Site that uses credential Handler API.
<pl> Thanks for the clarification Dmitri - that's the perspective 
  I was looking for
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Empty because you the user in your browser has 
  not encountered any wall instead of asking permission so just to 
  clarify things.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah that's an excellent clarification and now I'm 
  thinking that I probably should have put a slide before this that 
  explains how things work today so the the way things work today 
  is like think about log in with Google or log in with Facebook 
  when you go to a website they tell you what you're allowed to use 
  to login right so that website basically says I support log in 
  with Google you know login with.
Manu Sporny:   Facebook log in with whatever and those are the 
  only choices you get.
Manu Sporny:  What chappie does is the opposite we prefer that 
  the individual comes with the set of like digital wallets that 
  they have in the website you know when it pops up the dialogue it 
  shows them the things that they prefer not what the website 
  prefers the one thing that we're concerned about one future that 
  kind of chap he's concerned about and is trying to prevent is 
  this future where effectively you go to website and they say you 
  can use your.
Manu Sporny:   Apple wallet or your.
<kerri_lemoie> Slide 4: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/166wxPer_d_xN9afCdAO7PGYrVGlKYXP0gLZSKlejOVE/edit#slide=id.g1b0ca5e3588_0_16
Manu Sporny:  That's it right so we're trying to empower 
  individuals to have while it choice and that's kind of the whole 
  thing behind chappie really good clarifications thank you Carrie 
  and Dimitri okay I'm going to go on to the next item the next 
  item has to do with selecting a digital wallet so when you go to 
  do something like you go to a website and.
Manu Sporny:   A website.
Manu Sporny:  Through let's say you go to an issuer like a 
  university and you go through a class and you're ready to pick up 
  that credential what you earned during that class and putting in 
  digital wallet at that point chappie is invoked it shows this 
  wallet selection screen and says you know this website wants to 
  store credentials which wallet do you want to put them in right 
  that's effectively the question that chappies asking and then you 
  select one of your wallets the same thing kind of.
Manu Sporny:   It happens when you go to a verifier site so let's 
  say you go.
Manu Sporny:  And a job hiring site and it wants proof that you 
  you know have a certain level of Education it'll say hey this 
  website wants credential from you it wants an education 
  credential from you of some kind again the chappie dialog pops up 
  you select you know a wallet and appropriate wallet and then it 
  takes you to this kind of screen on the right so meaning that it.
Manu Sporny:   It takes you through.
Manu Sporny:  Of like selecting the appropriate credential the 
  the animation that you see on the right here is kind of a 
  demonstration of both sending a credential in receiving a 
  credential actually let me make sure that that's true.
Manu Sporny:  This is credentialed pick up so someone has gone to 
  in this is the US citizenship and Immigration Services kind of a 
  demo they're using a digital wallet they go to the website 
  they're picking up their additional permanent resident card 
  chappie pops up ask you which while you want to put it in the 
  user selects a wallet and then the wallet gives them a little 
  more information about what they're about to store so the wallet 
  pops up and this is the other really important thing with chappie 
  is that we make sure that we.
Manu Sporny:   / All of kind of the rendering and flow to the 
  wallet so the wallet.
Manu Sporny:  Help the individual make the best decision for them 
  so so one of the things that's involved there is like Gathering 
  consent so the wallet here is basically saying hey this website 
  wants to store this digital permanent resident card why don't you 
  take a look at it and make sure this is something that you want 
  to put in your wallet right and so the user kind of expands it 
  they take a look at it and they go yeah that looks pretty 
  reasonable and they click store in and do that.
Manu Sporny:   You can imagine scenarios.
<pl> So the wallet renders the card's details BEFORE accepting 
  into their wallet.  Very useful to have that 'check before store' 
  feature
Manu Sporny:  Are the wallet might go hey I don't know anything 
  about this site and they're asking you for your permanent 
  resident card or they're asking you for your credit card or your 
  driver's license and you can go ahead and do this but I don't 
  know who this website is right or the digital wallet can go hey 
  like there's a big problem here like this website is a known you 
  know fishing site.
Manu Sporny:   In your about to send your digital credentials.
Manu Sporny:  We suggest that you don't do that so there or the 
  you know the wallet can do something like hey they're asking for 
  proof of education and you've got like these three different ways 
  you could send it over you know we suggest you pick this one 
  which is you know protects your privacy the most or this one 
  which you know shows you in the best light or you know things 
  like that so the the point here is that.
Manu Sporny:   We want to make sure.
Manu Sporny:  When an individual picks a wallet that the 
  individual has a relationship with that wallet they kind of know 
  how it works and how it displays information to them and so we 
  don't presume meaning chappie doesn't presume that the user 
  interface should be rendered in any specific way make sure that 
  the wallet gets to show the individual you know those other 
  screens so that's basically wallet selection it's a part of 
  chappie it's.
Manu Sporny:   Built-in it's built into the into the.
Manu Sporny:  Kind of flow of receiving credentials and 
  presenting credentials let me pause there see if there any 
  questions before I move on.
Manu Sporny:  Yes yes it is possible in I mean this is you know 
  one of those areas of debate and concern right so there have been 
  a number so the answer your question David is yes that's 
  completely possible if the website allows you to issue in the two 
  different wallets or 22 different you know identifiers it's you 
  can do that right chappie doesn't get in the way of that 
  happening what has come up over the.
Manu Sporny:   Ears is should.
Manu Sporny:  Should we always display all the wallets in chappie 
  like is there a way for us to say hey this website wants for 
  example a permanent resident card from you you've got five 
  wallets but there's only one of them that has a permanent 
  resident card in there so shouldn't we make the interface easier 
  or simpler by just showing one option because there's only one 
  wallet that can actually answer the question that the.
Manu Sporny:  That's an open topic right it's also kind of open 
  of you know some of these wallets have this concept of like 
  profiles or different like personas in should we expose that in 
  the interface you know or not the good news here is that you know 
  chappie allows us to kind of iterate through these various ways 
  of doing things in those are very much kind of you know in the 
  future we have to.
Manu Sporny:   You know we.
Manu Sporny:  That you know more kind of deployment feedback 
  before we start implementing some of those features and some of 
  those features are not without privacy drawbacks right the more 
  you are able to interrogate the wallet or the more websites able 
  to interrogate the wallet about what kind of credentials you 
  might have in there the more the less privacy preserving we are 
  right and so we tend to optimize on privacy first meaning never 
  expose anything to the website that's a.
Manu Sporny:   Asking for information you know they.
Manu Sporny:  Just ask a question in from their point of view 
  from the websites point of view it goes into You Know The Ether 
  which is chappy and then chappie takes the question to the wallet 
  and then the wallet decides how it wants to respond and then 
  sends the response back to the website there so there are a lot 
  of really interesting questions here around the interface here in 
  what's the easiest thing to kind of show in youth.
Manu Sporny:  Yes so today the second thing that you said is what 
  we'd have to do they would be two transactions one to deliver 
  your you know ID and the other one to deliver the the education 
  credential from the other wallet clearly that's not ideal in 
  we're trying to figure out if there is a better way of kind of 
  collecting credentials from a variety of.
Manu Sporny:   Of different wallets and sending them over in one.
Manu Sporny:  It's very much I think in the active area of kind 
  of like research right now.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah that's exactly right yeah and and and I think 
  that that that issue ends up becoming much more exacerbated when 
  we have digital wallets when you have the concept of like you 
  have many different credentials right but yeah.
Manu Sporny:  Yep yep yep exactly yeah so there are trade-offs 
  yeah excellent question David and their trait they're absolutely 
  trade-offs here right the trade-off is that if we do this in 
  multiple transactions then the flows more confusing or it can be 
  more challenging to the individual right and so there have been 
  suggestions like you know is there a way for us to aggregate the 
  requests across a variety of different wallets in the amino the 
  answer is yes of course it's technology there is a way.
Manu Sporny:   A to do that but then we make the protocols more.
<pl> You could have different credential wallets for your 
  different personas, and credentials related to them. That's 
  actually useful, at least as David notes, at this stage.
<kerri_lemoie> slide 5: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/166wxPer_d_xN9afCdAO7PGYrVGlKYXP0gLZSKlejOVE/edit#slide=id.g1b0ca5e3588_1_578
Manu Sporny:  For developers and then we you know could could 
  have privacy implications as a result of that it's harder to 
  develop in the ecosystem and so on and so forth so I think you 
  know us as a community figuring out the right way to do that is 
  still you know many years away but great question David okay so 
  this is digital wallet selection okay so the other thing to 
  understand about chappy is that.
Manu Sporny:   We were trying to go for a solution that worked in 
  every browser.
Manu Sporny:  That that that exists right meaning that if you 
  have a modern browser chappy works. It is implemented as what is 
  called a polyfill and a polyfill is a bunch of JavaScript code 
  that a web developer puts into their website so for example a 
  university that wanted to issue verifiable credentials would have 
  to include this one line of this one line of JavaScript in there.
Manu Sporny:   Are University website a.
Kerri Lemoie: Polyfill: 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)
Manu Sporny:  Site that would want to receive verifiable 
  credentials would have to include this one you know line of 
  JavaScript and and of course right right against the the 
  credential Handler API to store or receive credential so the 
  point here is that for individuals they don't have to install a 
  browser plug-in they don't have to use a very specific browser no 
  matter what browser they're on it should work the downside to 
  that.
Manu Sporny:   That is that we are limited in what we can do.
Manu Sporny:  As our technology and chappie has become kind of 
  caught up in this whole like transition away from third-party 
  cookies so for those of you that may not be aware third-party 
  cookies are used by the ad industry to track people as they go 
  from website to website they're viewed as kind of this really bad 
  toxic thing on the web because it is what allows you know adds to 
  kind of track what you're doing what you're looking at as you go 
  from from site to site.
Manu Sporny:   Site so all the bread.
Manu Sporny:  Manufacturers are trying to eliminate third-party 
  cookies and they're trying to put in Alternatives the good news 
  here is that we saw this coming many years ago with chappie and 
  chappie gracefully degrades when we don't have access to 
  third-party cookies so what you see on the left here is the kind 
  of fully integrated experience in chappie meaning that when 
  you're using your web browser this screen just pops up and it's 
  nice and integrated into.
Manu Sporny:   Whatever workflow you're in you pick your wallet 
  in you do.
Manu Sporny:  Are things right the there's a bunch of Technology 
  on how this works right there's a lot of kind of Technology 
  gymnastics happening behind the scenes to make this work but 
  sometimes but one of the things that we use or third-party 
  cookies and when we don't have third-party cookies we have to 
  fall back we have to do what's called degrading gracefully in the 
  browser space so what and by degrade what we mean is we can no 
  longer show this window in line.
Manu Sporny:   We have to do a pop-up and when we do a pop up.
Manu Sporny:  All of us.
Manu Sporny:  This weird site called off and not I owe this is 
  the chappie mediator site the UI is still the same inside the 
  window but the window pops up right so on a mobile device it's 
  not too bad of an experience in fact you kind of expect it on a 
  mobile device but on like a desktop it's a bit weird right and so 
  we're working with folks like Google's Chrome team to figure out 
  how to get better native support for chappie but.
Manu Sporny:   The point here is.
<kerri_lemoie> Slide 6: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/166wxPer_d_xN9afCdAO7PGYrVGlKYXP0gLZSKlejOVE/edit#slide=id.g1b0ca5e3588_1_353
Manu Sporny:  Chappie works on all modern browsers and so if you 
  need to move credentials from point A to point B in your in the 
  browser environment chappies going to work fairly well for you 
  real quick we use chappy during the jobs for the future plugfest 
  we demonstrated 81 different interoperability combinations a 
  different wallets five web-based wallets in three native mobile 
  apps so.
Manu Sporny:   Chappie works for both web-based model.
<kerri_lemoie> Slide 7: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/166wxPer_d_xN9afCdAO7PGYrVGlKYXP0gLZSKlejOVE/edit#slide=id.g856c91d9b3_0_22
Manu Sporny:  It's a native mobile apps we integrated with a 
  bunch of different issuers and we'll see a demo on how this works 
  later on but this is kind of the list of companies that 
  demonstrated interop using chappie in just to go through kind of 
  you know the three steps again just to review so chappie allows 
  credential Handler registration so it allows a website to say I 
  want to be a digital wallet for you and manage your credentials.
Manu Sporny:   What's the code.
Manu Sporny:  He requests that a request to be a credential 
  Handler for you you click allow or block and then when you click 
  allow the credential Handler it's ready and that's the only thing 
  you have to do to register when you go to store something you as 
  the individual go to a website you go through some process that 
  results in a verifiable credential that could be issued that 
  website then uses.
Manu Sporny:   Happy it makes an API call to.
Manu Sporny:  Say I want to store this credential at which point 
  your digital wallet pops up shows you an interface gets your 
  consent and if you click yes I want to store it the website then 
  gets a response back saying that the credential was stored 
  successfully and if if you say no I don't want to store at the 
  website gets a notification that you did not store the credential 
  for some reason for whatever reason you know details go back to 
  the website other than that credential was installed.
Manu Sporny:   ORD the third thing is presentation so again 
  pretty much.
<kerri_lemoie> Slide 9: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/166wxPer_d_xN9afCdAO7PGYrVGlKYXP0gLZSKlejOVE/edit#slide=id.g856c91d9b3_0_59
Manu Sporny:  You go to a website the website requests a bunch of 
  verifiable credentials from you your digital wallet pops up and 
  you select the credentials that you want to send over potentially 
  and you know privacy-preserving ways the wallet gets consent from 
  you and then it's sent to the the website in all of these flows 
  it is really important to understand that the website that's 
  requesting the information from you gets.
Manu Sporny:   Zero visibility.
Manu Sporny:  Your wallet or what you're doing in your wallet or 
  any of that stuff so that's kind of it's really important again 
  like we optimize very aggressively for privacy in none of your 
  information is shared until you know you provide consent of some 
  kind Nate I see you're on the queue.
Nate Otto:  Yeah thanks I have a question about the scope of what 
  a website can request at this step in the process within the 
  education space we have I mean we have notably the open badges 
  standard and I'll open badges credentials share the same type so 
  if a website is trying to ask for a certain you know open badge 
  that meets us more complex characteristic they probably don't.
Nate Otto:   I want to just ask for hey give me any open badge 
  you have.
Nate Otto:  What types of scenarios are imagined within chappy 
  for the type specific query Inge and how can other more specific 
  communities layer onto this to enrich the possibility for how we 
  understand like what different types of queries are possible when 
  it's all open batch type credentials.
Manu Sporny:  Got it yeah that's an excellent question Nate so so 
  chappie is agnostic to the quarian response format chappies kind 
  of like a dumb Communication channel it doesn't try to get in 
  between you know the the language that's spoken from the 
  requesting website and the digital wallet the short answer to 
  your question today is there's a specification called the 
  verifiable presentation request spec VPR.
Manu Sporny:   In VPR has this mechanism in it.
<kerri_lemoie> Verifiable Presentation Request: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vp-request-spec/
Manu Sporny:  And so what the website typically does is the 
  website goes like the website that's requesting information says 
  I want to see a credential that looks like this and it's a fairly 
  freeform thing meaning it can say I want to see a credential that 
  has a type of open badge and I want to see an achievement type of 
  you know X or I want to see it have a field with a certain.
Manu Sporny:   Date or I.
Manu Sporny:  Have you know an issuer of a certain type so the 
  short answer is the thank you Carrie for linking the PPR Square 
  spec in there the VP R-Spec has mechanician mechanisms to do that 
  kind of querying but I have to definitely warn people like it is 
  very early days like query by example what we're trying for there 
  is just like a really simple.
Manu Sporny:   The mechanism for Developers.
Manu Sporny:  And it may become you know badges may become like 
  really really complex like you know learning records like full 
  lers you know querying for like you know something in an alley 
  are might be like a really complex query so I don't want to 
  convey that like this is a solved Problem by any stretch of the 
  imagination like today we can do like really simple checking 
  against types in certain types of fields in I'm pretty certain 
  like.
Manu Sporny:   That'll work for like.
Manu Sporny:  Use cases but it will not work for like a hundred 
  percent so chappie is agnostic to the query format there are 
  other presentation request you know formats out there like 
  presentation exchange and there's no reason chappie can't also 
  support presentation exchange as as a query you know response 
  protocol so so hopefully Nee that that answered your question 
  like we can potentially do the type of selection that you want to 
  do today with verifiable.
Manu Sporny:   Sanitation request but I don't think.
<kerri_lemoie> Presentation Exchange: 
  https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/
Manu Sporny:  I don't think it's ever going to be a 100% solution 
  I'm hoping that we don't have to go to like a super complex graph 
  query language right or like people writing SQL queries or or 
  unstructured database queries to get the data like to get the 
  credentials that they need but if if that were to happen chappie 
  can support it as a different query type did.
Manu Sporny:   That answer your question.
Nate Otto:  Yeah absolutely that's a good explanation of kind of 
  the state of the art and I imagine we will see a wide variety of 
  levels of support across different wallets and so nobody should 
  expect to be able to have very rich querying and accurate 
  responses broadly anytime soon cast a wide.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah that's that's right yeah I think that's 
  absolutely right I think that the best thing that we can do as a 
  community is like maybe start depending on type data a little bit 
  more so that you know so that people can be more accurate you 
  know when the issue something and when they when they request 
  something.
Manu Sporny:  And it's Dimitri I think you're on the Queue next.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah I wanted to say a few more words about 
  the clearing part so as not to mention its early days and well 
  the query is limited at the moment we essentially have all of the 
  query parameters that were likely to need developers mean you can 
  request by type so you can say give me an open badge credential 
  but you can also say give me some bad we could ensure we.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   With this particular achievement you can see.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Worse for example you can say I only want 
  credentials from this issuer you can filter by credential subject 
  ID so basically any sort of fields that you can picture in the in 
  your credential how going Clary can contain that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A couple of really interesting other flexible 
  things that the query can contain such as.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  User if you don't have any wallet registered 
  with the browser here are some where you might want to look right 
  so we it has a nice.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Warding workflow where users have no idea what 
  job you have doesn't have a wallet or anything like that the 
  first time they come to a website that ask for a credential they 
  can on board onto a wallet right off of there so come to the 
  university or some verifier and it says give me your class 
  completion credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   But I don't have a wallet.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I haven't gone and gotten the credential the 
  the same query that is asking for the wallet can say okay if you 
  don't have it here are some wallets that we the verify recommend 
  but you can your few free to use other one but here are some the 
  start you with the go get a wallets for the credential and come 
  back and forth on sequential the other thing that chappy does 
  that Mama hasn't come beside too much in this.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Presentation but I.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I think is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Youthful if that it does did authentication so 
  since it can ask for any sort of credential it can ask for what 
  we think of as traditional verifiable credential but other things 
  that it also can ask for is login and authentication and 
  permission potential now that's an advanced topic we can go over 
  that in another in another call but just.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Just keep it in the back of your mind.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This also enabled really nice really nicelogin 
  flows and lastly what I already mentioned is that chappy itself 
  is what's called a dumb pipe does not does not care what goes 
  into the request.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And so there are several query specification 
  of the you can include one of them do their final presentation 
  request very linked to get the one from this presentation 
  exchange and any others as they as they emerge in the community 
  so it's important to remember that this.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah the credential Handler API mechanism can 
  be used with all of the apis that are currently in the wallet 
  ecosystems that could be used with DC API using Wallace it can be 
  used with open-ended connects family of wallet and potentially 
  can be used with did come back early.
Manu Sporny:  Yep L all excellent points Dimitri absolutely Phil 
  I think you're on the Queue next.
Kerri Lemoie:  So before you go outside and tripped I just want 
  to keep an eye on the time and know that Manu does have a demo 
  and I want to make sure we can fit that into okay just keep an 
  eye on it thanks yes.
PL: Right and I can you hear can you hear me okay and I think 
  David maybe first but David you want to go first.
Kerri Lemoie:  You're the only person in the queue right now.
PL: Okay okay I just wanted to clarify and because I think this 
  is also the case and I want to make sure I'm right when the 
  request is made by let's say the relying party for a particular 
  credential filtered by whatever criteria are looking for the user 
  that has the wallet holder can accept or not that joy that choice 
  of response and can alter the response by putting in the 
  credential they would like to share themselves is that an.
PL:  accurate statement.
Manu Sporny:  Yes I don't know if you mean like if the website 
  just says I want an open badge credential and it's not specific 
  about the type the individuals wallet is going to basically show 
  them all they're open badges credentials in the individual can 
  basically be like oh I want to send this one because I know what 
  the site wants is that was that the question Phil.
PL: That's that's one variation of the question the other is they 
  request a credential with achievement X I don't want to send them 
  the one with achievement expects I want to send them one with 
  achievement why because I think it speaks more to my ability to 
  respond to let's say the job requirements of the position I'm 
  applying for.
Manu Sporny:  That's interesting um in theory yes I don't know 
  any wallets that allow that kind of like change in selection 
  today but you're absolutely right that you know why shouldn't 
  people be allowed to do that right if they want to.
PL: I'm specifically thinking of things like someone says I'd 
  like to see your full transcript I actually have a subset of my 
  transcript which has the courses relevant to what I think the job 
  is and not the courses that also include some you know things 
  that are outside the domain of the job and which in my view might 
  actually not be well received by the recipient and so I want to 
  give him the one I want to show they can also say I you know I 
  want the whole thing anyway and then it's my choice to decide.
PL:  to complyor not.
Manu Sporny:  That's right yeah yeah and you know my expectation 
  in these scenarios is that at least as an ecosystem chappie and 
  most of the wall it's optimized for privacy and individual 
  consent and choice in that all lines up with what you're saying 
  right thanks Phil okay real quick to the demo let me see can 
  everyone see my screen right now.
<kayode_ezike> Interesting point Phil! I would imagine that the 
  site should design the query such that it is inclusive of as many 
  qualifying credentials as possible.
Manu Sporny:  Okay alright so the demo is basically I mean you 
  know it's really kind of simple and straightforward I've got a 
  wallet here this is the various wallet and it's got three 
  credentials in it a permanent resident card alumni credential be 
  ticket and then you know I can click on something to see the you 
  know the credential in detail I also have this learned Card 
  Wallet up and learned card did a fantastic job you know of 
  integrating.
Manu Sporny:   Is it all the other wallet vendors of integrating.
Manu Sporny:  As you can see learn cards interface for their 
  wallet is quite different from chappies in fact it's way more 
  slick right so you look at it here this is your credential if you 
  click view details the credential flips over and you can read the 
  description issue or you know criteria really love what they've 
  done with the interface here but these are the two wallets that 
  you know I have chosen to use as an individual and so when I go 
  to a website so this is a website that just.
Manu Sporny:   Just issues credentials in I'm going.
Manu Sporny:  Select the plugfest to credential this one here so 
  this is a jobs for the future plugfest to credential I'm going to 
  click generate verifiable credential and so it basically calls 
  and back-end and issues the credential to me I can take a look at 
  this you know it's a verifiable credential that's an open badge 
  credential and then when I click store in wallet that is when 
  chappie pops up so when I click store in wallet chappie pops up 
  this interface and it says this.
Manu Sporny:   Website wants to send.
Manu Sporny:  You and it clearly outlines what the sent in the 
  ascending website is and then it gives me two selections for my 
  wallet I can pick the various wallet or the learn card app at the 
  credential in it also by default just remembers your choice for 
  the website you know in the future you'll probably continue to 
  use the same wallet but in this case I don't want it to do that 
  right I wanted to ask me every single time even in the future.
Manu Sporny:   If if it auto selects a wallet I can go back and 
  so now you.
Manu Sporny:  I don't want to use a different wallet you know I 
  know I use you know wallet a ninety percent of the time in this 
  website but this time I want to use while it be speaking to what 
  you mentioned David and then I basically select the wallet and 
  then the wall its interface pops up again like we chappie totally 
  defers to the wallet to show the interface this is the wallet 
  rendering the interface where I can see the details of the 
  credential I'm about to pick up and when I click store it's 
  stored and then I'm sent back to.
Manu Sporny:   To the website that I was on so if I go to my 
  wallet see there were three credentials before.
Manu Sporny:  Refresh my wallet now I should be able to see for 
  credentials in there including the new one that I just picked up 
  this jobs for the future plugfest credential right so that's me 
  picking it up in one wallet I can do the same process again so 
  pick the plugfest to wallet but this time I'm going to store it 
  in my learn card wallet so I picked the learn card app which is 
  then going to put up its own interface so this is the learn car.
Manu Sporny:   And while it's.
<kerri_lemoie> CHAPI is also being added to some mobile wallets.
Manu Sporny:  And they're asking me if I want to accept or reject 
  this credential I can kind of view the details here and then 
  click accept to accept the credential and then learn card 
  successfully stored it in the learn card wallet so that's that's 
  it like that you know it's fairly straightforward there's you 
  know not too much excitement you know going on there jumping back 
  really quickly because I know we're almost out of time.
Manu Sporny:   There's a chappie.
Manu Sporny:  In the slide deck feel free to look through it 
  we've been at this for a while now it's taken a lot of time to 
  figure out the right way to get this integrated into the browser 
  such that it works across all desktop browsers all tablet 
  browsers old mobile app browsers you would not believe the number 
  of variations of browsers out there so it's taken us a while to 
  get it working 100% across-the-board more recently we've been 
  able to demonstrate interop going really well using chappie but I 
  think the.
Manu Sporny:   Most interesting.
Manu Sporny:  Going to happen in the chappie roadmap over the 
  next couple of months to years so this year chappy is going into 
  production it's they're going to be data dedicated data center 
  teams running chappie so if you want to use chappie in production 
  it is definitely the year to start doing that we're adding better 
  integration for Native apps so that native apps show up in the 
  chappie selector right now they don't but we want them to we are 
  adding in some variations.
Manu Sporny:   Ation of the oid.
Manu Sporny:  Port so why DC for VCI and oid see for VP we are 
  working with Google's Chrome team on you know native bars are 
  experiments and integration there we expect some of that native 
  browser code to be shipped it is already shipping fed seems 
  already shipping in the latest version of Google Chrome so we're 
  expecting a couple of new features that we might be able to use 
  to make the chappie experience better so that we don't have to 
  gracefully degrade we can.
Manu Sporny:   Have a really nice native in browser experience 
  and then.
Manu Sporny:  25 And Beyond continued you know upgrades and 
  improvements okay one of the just real quick and then back over 
  to you carry one of the most exciting things that's happening 
  right now is that the browser teams are starting to look at 
  chappy and go hey you know what we think we can map it to some of 
  the Native stuff that we're working on in the FED CM work which 
  is built into the browser you'll note that they're kind of 
  account selection screen looks very similar.
Manu Sporny:   Her to the chappy while its selection screen to 
  the.
Manu Sporny:  You know say.
Manu Sporny:  Go to came and presented to the ccg last week and 
  said that he feels like all of these things that are highlighted 
  could be aligned their links in the presentation deck to chappie 
  and the polyfill and all that kind of stuff and with that back 
  over to you Kerry.
<pl> Great presentation Manu!
Kerri Lemoie: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-edu/
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you Maya that was excellent I know you fit 
  in a lot into this this one hour or less but thank you for coming 
  today everyone keep an eye on your inbox if you're not on the vcg 
  mailing list I you can join it here we're actually working that 
  we see AG co-chairs are working with digital promise and learning 
  economy foundation on a badge where you can try this out for 
  yourself so keep your eyes open for that in the near future and 
  you can give it a shot.
Kerri Lemoie:   And see what you think about it thanks everybody 
  hope you have a great week.
Manu Sporny:  Thanks for having me have a good one everyone.
<pl> Cheers
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Susan do you have a question.
<taylor_(lef)> Thank you Manu, Kerri and all :)
