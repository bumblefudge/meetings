  remember, you can type 2 or 3 letters and hit tab
Juan Caballero: It'll even put the colon after it for you.  try 
  it!
Juan Caballero: I think safari doesn't show that panel
Juan Caballero: By default

Topic: Introductions and Re-introductions

David Mason:  Work for Government of Canada
Juan Caballero: David Mason! we met at IIW, glad to cross paths 
  again
David Chadwick:  Introduces himself, member of VC working group
Kim Hamilton Duffy: DavidC is David Chadwick
David Chadwick:  Implementation ready.  back to participating in 
  group
Kerri Lemoie:   Works with OpenBadges, technology researcher

Topic: Survey of emerging standards

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Will be working on draft of data standards, 
  e.g., openbadges as VC, work with credential engine registry, 
  taxonomies
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Start with emerging standards, today some 
  from credentials community group
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1izgO1ln5MgYOLlSCpTiWAvFXHEtidZudpD2C-ztCMx4/edit?usp=sharing
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Also talk about future work from DID group.  
  would like to incorporate european work
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  First of series talking about emerging 
  standards.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Will talk about credential apis.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:   Will help to share notes about related 
  efforts
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Greg Nadeau could talk about broward
Want to hear about european work.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Start with slide 3
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  DID:  uri from which DID doc can be 
  retrieved
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Explaining DID identifier and what it looks 
  like
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  DID string can be resolved to verify key 
  ownership
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Like issuer id in openbadges, or email for 
  subject
Kim Hamilton Duffy:   OpenBadges 2.1 will support DIDs
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Go to slide 4
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Did:web uses domain name for verification
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Did:web slides: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wWI2qeQfgOgFdDp5Adt9hwHxVTt-ctG9naBEpNjOSTo
Dimitriz: author of did:web
Dimitriz: motivation for did:method, context, where it fits in, 
  challenges
Dimitiz: DIDs uniquely identify issuer and the entity being 
  issued to
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Slide 4 is super helpful
Dimitriz: helps disambiguate
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Did can be reused
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Go to slide 5
James Anderson:  During the slides, feel free to be very brief in 
  scribing. The slide link is part of the minutes [scribe assist by 
  Kim Hamilton Duffy]
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Govs don't want to be responsible for managing 
  identities
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Explains slide 6
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Identifiers should be reusable across contexts
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Identifiers should provide info about entity
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Skip to slide 16
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Some dids are ephemeral
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Explains different implementations of dids
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Blockchain based: coin based, non-coin based, 
  ledgers internal like hyperledger
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Jump to slide 19
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Key management and building wallets is hard
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Same problems with all dids, how to manage 
  private keys
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Problem with DIDs, how do we know issuer key 
  belongs to issuer
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Go to slide 20
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Trying to solve problem of trust anchors
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So why not reuse infrastructure around domain 
  names
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Slide 21
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Stick did:web in front of url and you get a 
  did
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Did document you get back is same as any other
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Explains how to bind did to domain
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Slide 23 - benefits of did:web
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Did:web provides bridge step until dids 
  solidify
Dmitri Zagidulin:  How do we protect integrity - blockchain 
  provides some
Dmitri Zagidulin:  How do we make sure document doesn't change
Dmitri Zagidulin: Hashlinks can lock down contents of did 
  document so it can't be changed
Dmitri Zagidulin: Hashlinks also allows specifying backup links
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Certificate authorities can get hijacked - ca 
  transparency can help - fairly robust
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Ledger solutions will look like ca 
  transparency
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Some certificate transparency references: 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency
Kim Hamilton Duffy: https://www.certificate-transparency.org/
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Did:web with hashlinks - how to add key, 
  revoke or rotate - breaks hashlink - confident of solution 
  because precedents like keybase
Juan Caballero: Keybase.io
Juan Caballero: Ipfs and ipld
Juan Caballero: KERI
Juan Caballero: You mean?
Kim Hamilton Duffy: KERI yes
Juan Caballero: Or the SCIDs piece?
Juan Caballero: (Two different way of certifying through rotation 
  :D)
Juan Caballero: (Both by sam smith - hard day to be the scribe!)
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Good point. Here's a link to KERI info: 
  https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/KERI-Universal-DKMI.md
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Did working group is working on ability to 
  reuse service enpoints to chain dids
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Push credential issuer discussion to next 
  week
Chris Winczewski:  Slide 21,22 - is key material separate from 
  domain structure?
James Chartrand is scribing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Could reuse public key in ca, but don't have 
  to
Durga Prasad: Durgaprasad814 call me Durga
Durga Prasad: https://docs.opencerts.io/dns_verification.html
Durga Prasad:  Using openattestation - similar to did:web?
Durga Prasad:  Explains how text field of dns record is used
Durga Prasad:  How do we deal with lesser known domains?
Dimitriz:  answer: partner with better known institution
Kerri Lemoie:   What happens if domain changes hands
Juan Caballero: Or if all .org TLD management changes hands :_(
Dimitriz: hashlinks prevent changes to past dids with hashlinks
Dimitriz:  but is a problem in general - cert transparency may 
  help
Tzviya Siegman: https://credweb.org/
Tzviya Siegman:  Mentions credible web - considering using VC.  
  and are talking about domain names changing hands
Tzviya Siegman:  Credweb is addressing question of what is a 
  credible web site
Dmitri Zagidulin: https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thanks dmitri
Dmitri Zagidulin: (Thank you tzviya, I definitely think the CCG 
  should collaborate with the Credible Web CG
