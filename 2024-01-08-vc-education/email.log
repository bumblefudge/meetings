<jeff_o_/_humanos> Kudos Komment:  As a "Professional 
  Appreciator", I wanted to express appreciation for the quality of 
  community and effort that is so consistent, last year and in 
  general, in this community and the tangential groups.  Very 
  heartening to watch all of the expertise and intention manifest 
  so well.  Looking forward to another year of appreciation.
