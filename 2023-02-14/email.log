<anil_john_[us/dhs/svip]> I do think that there is an aversion to 
  the term "blockchain" in the identity community **in the US** 
  that does not exist to that exist to that degree in the EU 
  (because of the federated nature of their Member States and their 
  focus on anti-competitive measures)
<limari_(dif)> I'm thinking more of the legislators
<anil_john_[us/dhs/svip]> There is a lesson for legislators in 
  how EU/EC/EBSI is walking the path -- distributed metadata 
  infrastructure <shrug>
