<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  The idea has not changed we launched the open Wallet foundation in February the end of February with the goal to bring a diverse group of developers together to create open source software we were very deliberate back then and we&apos;re still very deliberate in that we are trying not to be a standard development organization we believe that w3c and others. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:   It&apos;s like. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  Hands for the open ID Foundation or the iso Community are doing a fantastic job to create the specifications everything we do of course is based on a Bedrock of Open Standards but we are not going to dabble in the standard scheme what we are trying to do is to bring as many developers as possible together to develop open source components. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  What we mean by components is that the wallet space is a very complicated Beast even when you&apos;re look at one vertical like say identity you have a lot of different standards you have different credential standards you have different protocols to communicate those credentials and when you&apos;re interested in what I would call multi-purpose wallets this is only becoming. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  The standard for car keys and keys to your hotel room door even though they both pertain to physical doors are completely different standards you have standards for cryptocurrencies cbc&apos;s Fido passkeys airline tickets there&apos;s just a lot going on and in an Ideal World if you started with a clean sheet of paper maybe it would be possible. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  Torment with one architecture and you know really use this one approach for everything but given that there are so many developers and companies and Sovereign governments that are deeply vested into these ecosystems proposing quite different approaches we believe that the best we can do is to bring developers together to create components essentially. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:   The Lego blocks of. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  Approach really is therefore a bottom-up approach rather than a top-down approach the idea of different communities coming together proposing code for different standards and then over time the hope is that if we build a very large tent and we show developers other projects that are going on that there will be synergies some projects May merge some projects may become features of big. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  Some developers might decide to end their development and simply join another project but all of this is going to happen bottom up we will never tell developers try to force developers to merge their projects or to come together if that&apos;s not what they are what they&apos;re trying to do we launched with I think 36 members we now have 55 members. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:   Some of which are. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  He large companies some of which are startups we have a lot of nonprofit organizations and we are really proud of this mixed because an analogy I&apos;ve been using from the get-go is the chromium project with the rendering engine blink only for digital wallets but we want to make sure that there is not one company utterly dominating the open Wallet Foundation. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  And I think. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  When you look at the roster of companies so far we&apos;re doing an okay job to really have a diverse community of members. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  Before the end of the year we&apos;re going to formally launch the government advisory Council which is something that is rare for a Linux Foundation project we looked at other gags specifically the government advisory Council of I can in the domain space and the reason why we&apos;re so excited about the GAC is that a lot of the credentials in wallets or going to be private like. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  So fundamentally we believe that it is crucial to bring both the public sector and the private sector together to create meaningful discussion in order to get closer to the ultimate vision of having globally interoperable multi-purpose wallets. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
