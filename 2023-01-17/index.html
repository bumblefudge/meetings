<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Some some motivation to remind ourselves how how important and how fundamental did solution really is because it happens essentially all the time right if we do anything with verifiabler credentials or chapi or didcomm or open id connect it&apos;s always did resolution there&apos;s always a need to discover the did document to discover metadata about the subject that&apos;s identified. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   By the dids so here are some common examples that. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Probably everyone here is familiar with but just as some inspiration in them in a verifiable credential if we want to verify the proof of a verifiable credential we need to resolve the issue did to look up the issue as public key if we perform some kind of did auth flow did auth interaction whether it&apos;s based on chapi or didcomm or open id connect there is always some kind of challenge response pattern and. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   There&apos;s some kind of signature signed by someone who&apos;s identified by a did. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  So I can we need to resolve the did and of course we also need to resolve dids for discovering somebody&apos;s didcomm end point or decentralized web node or some other kind of service it&apos;s a really very fundamental function and because of that there are also a lot of implementations out there right this is just a very small subset of implementations that somehow implement the did resolution. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   Process there&apos;s the dif. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Universal resolver which is a resolver that can be run as a service and then there are several libraries veramo did kit Hyperledger Aries typescript resolve so there are resolvers implementations of did resolution they come in different forms and different languages and sometimes they are Standalone components and sometimes did resolution is built into something else so there&apos;s a lot of. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   Variety and quite a lot of implenmentations. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Because dids and did resolution are so fundamental to other things how is this defined right now so how do we know how did resolution works and the answer is there&apos;s a little bit of content in the did core specification which as we know as a w3c recommendation it has an entire section about resolution. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   And it also has a. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Section about the the identifier of course which talks a little bit about did parameters so these are some things that we have in the did core specification that have to do with with did resolution there&apos;s a definition of some functions resolve function resource representation the referencing functions and these functions specify what is the input and what is the output. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   So for example. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  If we resolve a did then there&apos;s really the did as one input and resolution options as another input and then as an output we get the did document but then we also get two types of metadata did resolution metadata did document metadata and some of that is also defined in in did core already so this is already a standard it defines some resolution option called accept. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   It defines some. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Resolution metadata called content type and error and some did document metadata about the did document when was it created when was it updated and and so on and then as I said there is also some did parameters did parameters are part of a did URL if we have a not just the did but a did URL with a path and the query string and and fragment. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   And did core also defines. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Defines the syntax of that and then defines some of these did paramters. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Did core did core standards doesn&apos;t Define it doesn&apos;t actually Define how this is really implemented in did core these things are related to did resolution or defined in an abstract way they are abstract interfaces with some abstract data structures but the did core specification doesn&apos;t Define for example a concrete algorithm if we look at this example. <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   Here it says did:ex:1234. <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-53').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-53').show()" id="53" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  And then there&apos;s a parameter called service then did core defines that there is this parameter called service and it defines a little bit what it means but did core doesn&apos;t Define how you actually the reference this if you reference is what exactly happens what exactly is the is the output and also here for example if we have a fragment so that&apos;s missing in did core. <a id="link-53" style="display:none;" href="#53">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-54').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-54').show()" id="54" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:   Another thing that&apos;s missing is. <a id="link-54" style="display:none;" href="#54">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-55').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-55').show()" id="55" class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Sabadello</span>:  Concrete representations or data formats for the did resolution results and the did URL dereferencing results with all this metadata right in did core we we specify representations and how to express a did document but we don&apos;t really Define a data format or representation or serialization of these other things that the metadata so this is also just mentioned in an in an abstract way but. <a id="link-55" style="display:none;" href="#55">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-211').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-211').show()" id="211" class="information">Harrison_Tang: One quick question for David David you mentioned you would like to talk about evidence properties I&apos;m just wondering you know how long will that take and also do you want if it&apos;s long then we probably should put that in the agenda. <a id="link-211" style="display:none;" href="#211">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-212').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-212').show()" id="212" class="comment"><span class="name">David Chadwick</span>:  Yeah, well actually, I won&#8217;t be here next week. I&#8217;m traveling. But basically there is a draft and all we&#8217;re wanting to do is to standardize what the type would be. Because as you know, the verifiable credential allows any evidence to be specified of any type, and so we&#8217;d just like to standarize one type, which refers to the Open ID Foundation&#8217;s existing draft specification on identity assurance. So they&#8217;ve actually, there&#8217;s been a working group working for a year or more on how do you assure identity and what evidence do you need to assure identity? So we&#8217;ve got a whole standard on this and we&#8217;d what like to do it import it into verifiable credential by saying if you have this particular type of evidence, then it means you&#8217;re using the Open IDF standard for evidence. That&#8217;s essentially it, the new work item. <a id="link-212" style="display:none;" href="#212">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-213').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-213').show()" id="213" class="information">Harrison_Tang: Got it okay maybe I can coordinate with you over email offline and then perhaps we could even get the open ID folks to join our meetings to kind of describe this topic a little bit further. <a id="link-213" style="display:none;" href="#213">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-214').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-214').show()" id="214" class="comment"><span class="name">David Chadwick</span>:  Yeah, what really interesting that came out of it actually is that when presenting evidence, they&#8217;re actually presenting a whole raft of evidence. So if you consider somebody&#8217;s name, their evidence might be &#8220;I took the name David Jones from the passport, and I took the name David Jones Smith from their driving license&#8221; and now you&#8217;ll see that you&#8217;ve got different evidence with different names because over time, someone might have changed their name or by deep pull or whatever. And so, there are two things that come out here - one is the evidence value, the evidence value is presented then not by the same as the actual value in the verifiable credential because of changes to them, and the second thing is that the evidence is somehow duplicating information in the verifiable credential such that if you were to do selective disclosure of the verifiable credential, but not selective disclosure of the evidence, you may actually be revealing evidence, information that you didn&#8217;t want to reveal in the selective disclosure. So that&#8217;s a really interesting thorny problem to discuss. <a id="link-214" style="display:none;" href="#214">✪</a></div>
