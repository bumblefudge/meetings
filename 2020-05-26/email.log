Christopher Allen:  Introductions
Moses Ma: Mark is new
Cochair of DID working group, works at evernym, in this community 
  for several years
Nat Holloway:  <Audio weak>
Nat Holloway:  Please recap on irc if possible
Nat Holloway: Linkedin public profile - 
  https://www.linkedin.com/in/nat-h-6382b8157
Christopher Allen: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/announcements/
Nat Holloway:  I don't have access to linkedin, can you 
  summarize?
Christopher Allen:  Identiverse
Christopher Allen:  Four weekly recurring meetings (see 
  announcements for details)
Sorry all, seems like I'm unable to join the voip.
Christopher Allen: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22action%3A+review+next%22
Mark_: try the plain old telelphone system
Nat Holloway: Rgrant Research Engineer at USAA. Work in USAA Labs 
  in identity, AI, crypto and general security.
Nat Holloway: Np
Manu Sporny:  Jsonld1.1 has finished work on spec
Manu Sporny:  And other framing algorithms
Moses Ma: Mark, you can call in via Skypeout, Whatsapp or some 
  low cost app from Europe: +1.540.274.1034 x6306
Manu Sporny: https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/json-ld11/
Manu Sporny:  W3C member organizations are expected to vote on 
  whether to approve the final specification.  It's very important, 
  if you're a W3C member, that you vote in favor of this technology 
  that underlies many of the specifications created by this 
  community group.
Manu Sporny: https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/jsonld-charter/
Manu Sporny:  The other thing is the lsonld1.1 WG maintenance 
  charter
Nat Holloway: Thank you kimhd!
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Regarding attendee list, I have the same 
  question for nikosft -- can you point me to a profile page we can 
  use for you (linkedin profile, twitter, or blog)?
Manu Sporny:  Active working groups reduces lag time in fixing 
  specificaitons
To maintain the registries
Christopher Allen: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit#heading=h.i2v9iagxg4em
Christopher Allen:  There was discussion here about outlining 
  what the two working groups did
+Present
Christopher Allen:  <...Is looking for some link in a document>
Manu Sporny: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit#heading=h.fe7a8nw475r
Christopher Allen:  Under our new charter we can define how we 
  handle work and task items, and we need to be more clear about 
  these processes.
Christopher Allen: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/75
Manu Sporny:  Regarding registries, there is some overlap with 
  Dan Burnett's responsibilities.  good news is that DID working 
  group has put in a lot of work that "is converging"
Manu Sporny:  Some work may be reusable.  there is a sane way to 
  do this without putting an insane amount of work on the CCG
Christopher Allen: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/3
Christopher Allen:  We need to move this all to ReSpec, but our 
  placeholder googledoc is linked
Christopher Allen:  Issue #3 is update to RSA signature suite
Christopher Allen:  We had a volunteer for a while but not 
  currently.  chairs have discussed this.  unless there is a 
  volunteer, we're going to close this [item from] this repo.
Manu Sporny:  It is going to be unavoidable that this crypto 
  suite gets used.  enterprise uses this instead of ed25519.
Orie Steele: Recommend RSA folks support 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/lds-jws2020
Orie Steele: And use it instead
Manu Sporny:  My concern is that if we archive it here no 
  community will be working on it.  candidate editors are too busy 
  working on DID things.
Manu Sporny:  We won't have a spec for the things that are 
  deployed.
Manu Sporny:  We're in a bad situation
Christopher Allen:  We recognie your hard work for this 
  community.
Christopher Allen:  At this point, it's incorrect
Can mark it
Orie Steele:  We should archive and document as we go
Christopher Allen: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/3
Moses Ma: Link for the Science article: 
  https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6492/719
Moses Ma:  Coauthor for paper for Science was trying to log into 
  call.
Christopher Allen: "Blockchain-facilitated sharing to advance 
  outbreak R&D"
Christopher Allen:  Now we move to item of the day: elections
Moses Ma: Mark, are you on the call now?
Moses Ma: Type q+ if you are
Christopher Allen:  Four years ago, verifiable credientials task 
  force moved to WG, and manu asked ChristopherA tot chair and 
  kimhd volunteered too, then less than a year later JoeAndrieu
Manu Sporny: I am forever grateful to ChristopherA and kimhd and 
  JoeAndrieu for stepping up as Chairs those many years ago. :)
Mark Leuba: Yes, I'm in. Regular phone. Low battery.
  ...joind and there was a lot of work and updating the chair was 
  supposed to be updated and elections and the charter needed 
  fixing.
Christopher Allen:  ChristopherA is not running for reelection.
Christopher Allen:  Nominations were announced a couple of weeks 
  ago.  nominations deadline was last night.  as of right now there 
  are three seats that are open under the new charter
Christopher Allen:  Kimhd has won uncontested, seat A
Moses Ma: All hail the great Kimleesi
Juan Caballero: Three cheers for Wayne!
Christopher Allen:  We only had one one nomination for the three 
  year seat, seat C, Wayne.  and wayne is now chair for that seat.

  all)
Heather Vescent: Yay and congrats to Kim and Wayne!

Heather Vescent:  Joined CCG due to interest in how the standards 
  process works - how the sausage is made.  had verymixed 
  experiences.  thought about leaving and for a while did step 
  away, but decided to give it my last stop.
Heather Vescent:  Be sure everything is thought through to 
  minimize unintended consequences
Heather Vescent:  Because technologists are so experienced at 
  solving the problems, they don't see the broader impacts in other 
  areas.

Topic: Science Paper

Christopher Allen:  Last call for questions.  topic moves to 
  Mark's paper
Mark Leuba:  Thanks for having me
Mark Leuba:  Bear with me, i'm new
Mark Leuba:  Invited by MosesMa and kimhd due to publication in 
  Science
Christopher Allen: Science Magazine "Blockchain-facilitated 
  sharing to advance outbreak 
  R&D"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6492/719
Mark Leuba:  Intro: innovation policy researcher at delft
Mark Leuba:  Not a computer scientists nor a developer, but 
  picked up DIDs and translated to my field of infectious diseases
Mark Leuba:  Aim is to identify barriers to effective cooperation
Mark Leuba:  Collaborating with infectious disease control at 
  Dutch <org>
Mark Leuba:  Collegue sat next to MosesMa on flight and got memed
Mark Leuba:  Trust issues are at the root of many problems that 
  we see for covid, that hamper outbreak response
Mark Leuba:  We need lots of different actors sharing data
Mark Leuba:  Several barriers related to private stakes: academia 
  wants to get publications
Mark Leuba:   This is disincentive to share research data.  we 
  have several incentivization problems.
Mark Leuba:  Dropping a link to initiate other discussion
Mark Leuba:  Our vision integrates <lots of stuff>
Mark Leuba:  We can shape a trust layer underneath existing 
  systems
Moses Ma: This proposed vision is called an ORBI - Outbreak R&D 
  Blockchain Infrastructure
Mark Leuba:  These barriers are still hampering effective disease 
  response in covid
Mark Leuba:  We're thinking about furhter papers and the existing 
  work is just a high-level abstract start
Mark Leuba:   Thanks for having me!
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Thanks Mark!
Christopher Allen:  Manages last comment.
Adrian Gropper:  How do you see reputation, bound in the academic 
  stuff, fitting into this community?
Moses Ma: Mark and I are working on a COVID project as well, 
  called COVID Defender, contact us for more info.
Mark Leuba:  Reputation very interesting.  it's key for academics 
  and others.  out of scope of current paper.  supplementary 
  materials discuss verifiable credentials could be used .
Moses Ma: I'll ask Mark to join the discussion forum as well
Mark Leuba:  We'd like to explore this better in the future.  the 
  paper is already information-dense and didn't have room for these 
  details.
Moses Ma: We had to smash a 12 page paper into 3 pages...
Mark Leuba:  If you think about the quality, you want something 
  like the existing reputation system in place.
Orie Steele: Example: signing COVID related JSON-LD used by 
  search engines, using Bitcoin and Ethereum curve:
