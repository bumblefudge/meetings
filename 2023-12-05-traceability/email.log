Nis Jespersen : 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/589
Patrick St-Louis:  On aligning workflows, 589?
Nis Jespersen :  From august... for some reason ben asked mahmoud 
  to comment
<orie> I have to drop, I suggest that issue be closed.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Manu's point is that this is already really 
  close, from what I'm reading of workflows as a concept, same 
  across both apis. So not sure what's an actionable item.
Patrick St-Louis:  So very similar but there will be differences 
  in the short term?
Nis Jespersen :  Still did auth based? we're large moving away 
  from that, to oauth. is that what we'd be aligning to here?
Patrick St-Louis:  As I understand workflows, whenever external 
  party wants to engage, workflow based on applications, this is 
  how exchange starts
Nis Jespersen :  Can read the def of how we use workflows. can 
  think of as way to combine diff presentations,m diff parties, 
  into same workflow
Patrick St-Louis:  I'll leave a comment here to discuss, if still 
  open in a few weeks close it

Manu Sporny:  Saw you were talking abt issue 539, thought I'd 
  provide some background
Nis Jespersen :  Volunteer to connect the two, patrick already 
  did. I think we could spend next 5mins trying to do that verbally
Manu Sporny:  Yes, highly aligned with vc-api.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Makes sense, but where's workflow instance 
  or def sent? equivalent to traceable presentation?
Manu Sporny:  Out of scope, undefined, implementations can define
Nis Jespersen :  Might want to look at how post them on trace 
  vocab
<chris_abernethy> I can do the minutes
Patrick St-Louis:  Writing comment on issue; propose we leave it 
  open til end of year
Nis Jespersen :  Great thanks
