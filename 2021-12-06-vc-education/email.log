Topic: Phil Long - Single Assertion Endorsements

PL: discussion on single assertion endorsements
<phil_l_(p1)> Link to my slides:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oAkF2DC_zvXvAQwITeD04V2JeSAsF8mrh1fJhAwDsws/edit?usp=sharing
<kerri> Thank you to who is sharing
It's me
<kerri> Is my screen visible?
PL: starting with design principles
PL: most physical identity transactions are transient
PL: physical interactions degrade over time
PL: endorsements are technical and transient
PL: Endorsements must be accepted by the holder/endorsee
PL: Endorser presents bona fides in their endorsement -  
  legitimacy as a credible reference
<kerri> Are my slides in your screens?
Yes
<david_chadwick> I have a black screen and no slides
<kerri> Thanks
<kerri> Sorry for technical issues. Can follow along here if you 
  can't see my screen: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oAkF2DC_zvXvAQwITeD04V2JeSAsF8mrh1fJhAwDsws/edit?usp=sharing
PL: other feedback on design principles?
<deb_everhart> goodn
<deb_everhart> good list
<adrian> The MITRE slide is actually credit to Chris Buchnan as 
  reused by me.
<timothy_summers> :+1:
PL: funding exists for single assertion credentials for 
  endorsement
<adrian> with permission by Chris.
Single assertion credentials for endorsements - 
<simone_ravaioli> On design principles: Make it super easy to 
  "endorse", like a FB thumbs up.  balance tech implementation with 
  UX.
<kerri> Endorsement spec info: 
  https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#Endorsement
PL: technical options - v2.2x OB example carries forward into OB 
  v3 context
KE: the idea of endorsements including LinkedIn endorsements, Q: 
  how do you think about verification
PL: how does one think about it from issued credentials versus 
  self-issued credentials
PL: secondarily the process/mechanism of verification
PL: the verification here is aligned to the VC data model
AG: 2 kinds of endorsements, related to identity and related to 
  validity
AG: real world identity is verified by notaries, is this 
  necessary in the education space?
<john_kuo> I think you can do in in a single issued credential
PL: started from the foundation the person is accruing these 
  credentials over a lifetime
PL: each credential should be inclusive of both identity and 
  validity, but open to other methods
AG: cost related to identity is often 0, cost related to a 
  credential is significant.
PL: make the creation of DIDs an easier process
PL: this would better align with the current world of, for 
  example, notaries at public libraries
PL: DID linking approach
DZ: example of the use of multiple signatures
DZ: various signature methods allow for more than one signature 
  and maintain integrity
DZ: what does it mean that 2 people find the VC
<juancaballero> Markus Sabadello even did a presentation (maybe 
  at a DIF meeting?) about multi-proof'd payloads

PROPOSAL:  Anchored Resources and Hashlinks for VCs https

DZ: what does it mean when an institution signs and then another 
  party signs the VC, what is implied?
<juancaballero> ...and mentioned the aforementioned semantic 
  black hole Dmitry is describing :D
Kerri Lemoie: @Juancaballero: do you have a link?
<kayode_ezike> Does proofPurpose in VC data model not resolve 
  that ambiguity?
DZ: downside is that proof methods are various
Juan Caballero: 
  https://identity.foundation/faq/#can-a-vc-be-signed-by-two-or-more-parties-how-do-i-produce-and-consume-multi-signed-vcs-%EF%B8%8F
DZ: they don't typically have the purpose of the signature at the 
  top level
<kerri> Thanks! @juancaballero
<kayode_ezike> Gotcha ðŸ‘ðŸ¾
DZ: purpose is not always explicit
Juan Caballero: 
  https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/blob/master/agenda2021.md#agenda---3-feb-2021---useu-time-0600-pt---update-on-did-core-and-enterprise-ethereum-alliance-d-burnett-and-did-interop-fundamentals-markus-sabadello-and-guests
<juancaballero> (oops broken link)
AG: issue of liability of the intent of the signature, endorser 
  is expected to keep a log of their endorsements, how far do we 
  want to go down the rabbit hole of current world of required logs
PL: questioning what ways can liability be limited, but don't 
  have legal interpretation currently
DZ: engineering perspective: do we know enough about the use case 
  around an issuer or signature log
DZ: wallet project in DCC is currently struggling with this 
  question
DZ: I haven't seen any standardizations at this point
PL: also relevent to Manu's proposal to status list
https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-list-2021/
Juan Caballero: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-status-list-2021/issues/2
<juancaballero> ^ Specific issue
DZ: status list is just another way of linking
<juancaballero> about new types/enums
PL: #2 is symantic free
PL: referencing Manu Sporny hash link model
Marty Reed:  Using smart contracts & hashed storage [scribe 
  assist by Kerri Lemoie]
Kerri Lemoie: MR: create VCs as hashed storage and reconnect them 
  on the user side.
Kerri Lemoie: MR: destination address is the contract
Kerri Lemoie: MR: example of destination is IPFS.; References 
  chain
Phil Long:  Create a single issue vc that describes where the 
  endorser is giving background & evidence of their endorsement 
  claim and then put it in IPFS which the wallet holder can point 
  to. [scribe assist by Kerri Lemoie]
Kerri Lemoie: MR: allows them to store the endorsement, license, 
  state & transcript - then package the three independently signed 
  objects into a single signed one.
Kerri Lemoie: MR:beauty of using the hash model, if the hash is 
  changed, then the VC is broken: multilayer protection.
<deb_everhart> very helpful explanation, thank you
<dmitri_zagidulin> I also have a proposal to the VC WG similar to 
  this: https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/831
PL: John Kuo with pocket has an endorsement issuance flow
JK: advantage of having a closed system
JK: self-issued credential and portfolio credential
JK: there is a request for an endorsement for a specific identity
JK: the request can also be a standalone endorsement
JK: self-issued credentail - recieve request, interpret request, 
  credential endorser signs and issues from their identity
PL: analogous to a professional org
JK: single asset example
JK: each endorsement credential is signed by a single entity
PL: lots more questions than answered in this discussion
<deb_everhart> would portfolio use case be similar to endorsing a 
  verified presentation?
PL: focusing on design principles for clarity
<kayode_ezike> *831
Dmitri Zagidulin: https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/831
<phil_l_(p1)> For contacting me, phil@rhzconsulting.com re: 
  endorsement credentials
DZ: use of content hash as an alternative
JK: pocket intented implementation is hash and UUID
<deb_everhart> thank you
JK: answer to DE, yes
<juancaballero> or to put it another way, a portfolio could be 
  expressed as a VP :D
<kayode_ezike> Cheers
