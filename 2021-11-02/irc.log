[2021-11-02T16:52:24.580Z]	<rgrant>	... i have 30 year old patents on this issue.  an old issue: when you delegate, what is delegated?  is it the identity or rights associated?
[2021-11-02T16:52:31.839Z]	<rgrant>	Clare: rights associated
[2021-11-02T16:52:49.467Z]	<rgrant>	Bob: it's a very important point for people to understand

[2021-11-02T16:53:08.703Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	This is a super important point -- and is one of the reasons why ZCAPs (authorization capabilities) are designed the way they are...
[2021-11-02T16:53:31.310Z]	<rgrant>	Clare: the other element is that we wanted something that could flow through to public sector.  it's a key principle around the world that identity cannot be delegated, so it's important to clarify
[2021-11-02T16:53:53.195Z]	<rgrant>	Dazza: this is an identity that a natural person acts through

[2021-11-02T16:55:20.513Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	The "reasons" were we had a huge ranked choice vote on it and the term "holder" was what we could agree to at the time. :P
[2021-11-02T16:55:25.884Z]	<rgrant>	agropper: your innovation was to switch from property law to agency law.  a question (buried in old CCG/SSI work) regards the label the subject of the identity as the holder instead of controller.  relabel?
[2021-11-02T16:56:52.533Z]	<TallTed>	well... It's often possible to effectively share one's identity ("here, Horace, use my passcard to get the thing from my office"), which is typically done where it's not possible to provide specific delegation (e.g., adjust systems to permit *their* passcard to open your door).  Sharing one's passcard is obviously problematic (e.g., as it makes it appear that *you*, not Horace, went through that door), but very common.
[2021-11-02T16:56:54.752Z]	<rgrant>	Christopher: never intended the SSI principles to be more than a starting point for a conversation.  changes possible given sufficient consensus.  a recent paper incorporated the principles in a list with more.  it may be time for a new generation of principles.  we jsut didn't want to say, five years ago, "owner".
[2021-11-02T16:57:10.953Z]	<rgrant>	... that would confuse judges

[2021-11-02T16:57:51.299Z]	<rgrant>	Angus: also a laywer and id thesis on philosophy of law.  we're talking here about a relationship of rights.
[2021-11-02T16:58:12.984Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	I'd be interested in a workshop(s) on the SSI principles and moving them to next generation.
[2021-11-02T16:58:17.801Z]	<rgrant>	... there's a similar concept that ownership is a bundle of rights.

[2021-11-02T16:59:08.234Z]	<ChristopherA>	agreed.
[2021-11-02T16:59:16.398Z]	<rgrant>	... where is this coming from ?  there's a terminological issue here, but there's also the legal implications.  a judge looking at this may find it similar to the bundle of rights theory
[2021-11-02T16:59:27.498Z]	<Heather_Vescent>	ack ChristopherA for followup
[2021-11-02T16:59:28.691Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	In education we struggle with "ownership" of ed data. Many have agreed that ownership belongs to the issuer but access/persistence belongs to individual.
[2021-11-02T16:59:38.906Z]	<rgrant>	Clare: difference is between US and Australian law

[2021-11-02T17:00:20.950Z]	<bobwyman>	But, are they "natural rights" or rights delegated by states?
[2021-11-02T17:00:44.970Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	Can we cover this topic more regularly?
[2021-11-02T17:00:59.539Z]	<rgrant>	Dazza: thing to keep an eye on is [lost details and] that this doesn't foreclose property viewpoints
[2021-11-02T17:01:11.700Z]	<TallTed>	"... unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness ..." and digital identity
[2021-11-02T17:01:27.217Z]	<rgrant>	Christopher: request for CCG is to look at privacy violations as a coercion of authority
