<div onmouseout="$('#link-54').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-54').show()" id="54" class="information">Jack: Sure. So at the Autonomy Foundation, me and my colleagues Rebel have been working on an implementation using one of the verification method proof types.It&apos;s currently called verifiable conditions, and this is the W3C CCG standard we have since the last meeting updated the name to conditional proof. This is to have a less less of an acronym clash with verifiable credentials of VCs. So the first thing is that we have a PR, it&apos;s been approved by one of the other coauthors and ready to just have that name change done in your repositories. I think it also makes sense for you guys to update the repository slug as well. That&apos;s the first thing. And the second thing is we&apos;ve actually implemented this condition, verifiable conditions that allows you to present delegated and multi-signature condition types inside a did document. And we&apos;ve implemented a verifiable credentials library that allows you to assign verifiable credentials with multiple or delegated signatures or combinations of the two. And it uses this verified verification method standard to prove that the condition was met. So I&apos;ve just shared two links. The first is a blog article that introduces the bigger scope of work having verifiable, verifiable credentials with multi-signature and delegated signatures. So that gives an overview. I think this is a this work we&apos;ve done from the Decentralized Identity Foundation repositories and we&apos;ve now got the links to our work there with the pull requests to a branch to represent upstream. So you can see exactly what we&apos;ve done on those repositories. We haven&apos;t got a a pull request to the upstream branches yet. I think it&apos;d be great for the community to start understanding what this standard looks like and having a more in-depth discussion probably at a later call. The second link I have there is the link to the pull request on the Verifiable conditions W3C ccg repo which we would like approved. <a id="link-54" style="display:none;" href="#54">✪</a></div>
