Topic: Anthony Camilleri - Europass as VCs

KL: intro Anthony
AC: introducing digital credentials part of EuroPasss
AC: major policy project of the commission, approximately 2MM 
  accounts and 10k new per day
AC: european standard comes out of leg. 2018 mandating a Euro 
  system for digitally signed qualifications
AC: starting with design prinicipals and standards to address all 
  levels of education Prek-University
AC: align with Euro Recognition Instruments, harmonizing 
  education systems in Europe
AC: Capture Formal and Informal, learning is learning
AC: applicable to the whole course lifecycle
AC: interoperable, free, and open source
AC: legal value across the EU
AC: no standard fully reflected lifelong learning, therefore 
  develop meta-model ELDM
VC model was a good foundation to start with
AC: something you have gained related to learning activitives
AC: achievement is something you've earned, learning outcomes, 
  knowledge, autonomy and responsibility
AC: including entitlements
AC: Lifecycle Concepts: specifications, learning opportunities, 
  credentials describing a claim
AC: specifications are interrelated, building on one another, 
  occupation, course, lesson plan
AC: Learning opportunity specification, add individual 
  information to create a credential
AC: Credential metadata- Issuer data and credential type, Claim - 
  Person ID (10-15 different identifiers) set of legal identifiers 
  defined by EU for signature, and action
AC: VC XML currently moving toward an RDF/JSONLD model
P1: question on entitlement
AC: entitlement = right to study, membership of an org as an 
  example
AC: start from Open Badges V3 spec
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> (sorry i was confused, was switching 
  devices :D )
<kerri_lemoie> All good @Juan :)
AC: the majority of our credentials are highly complex 60-70 
  claims per credential
AC:things we can use - type, achievementType
AC: TWCU - badgeclass and resultsDescription
<nate_otto> When you say a credential has 60 claims in it, area 
  these 60 described achievements, each of which might have 
  entitlements etc? Packaged together like a transcript? (For next 
  pause)
AC: TWCU - no nesting relationship between badgeclass and 
  resultdescription
AC: TWCU - everything has a URI
AC: the idea of creator inside credential subject is useful to 
  reference entities outside the credential
AC: Issues to Resolve - cannot support multiple claims
AC: proposal to solve - keep structure and create an array of 
  claims
AC: includes multiple types of claims within the array
AC: ITR - credential has a type at the top level
AC: Proposal - ass a credential type as a property
Add not ass
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> credential title as arbitrary 
  string/local alias or specified?
AC: within VC there are no properties to describe the credential 
  as a whole
AC: intrinsic part has to be the visual representation
AC: proposal - add displayproperties tag
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> i'm assuming that 
  `"id":"https://website-that-displays-credential.example.com"` 
  really means 
  `"id":"https://website-that-displays-credential.example.com/credential/{UUID}"`, 
  right?
AC: put the HTML directly in line within the credential
JC: question around credential title
AC: the credentialtitle is a simple text string
JC: like an alias string
JC: UUID in URL?
AC: ID of the credential is a UUID, link to a visual 
  representation can be a URL in the description
P1: link pointing to an IPFS location or the like?
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> CIDs not UUIDs :D
AC: in our implementation the entire HTML will be in the 
  credential
<dmitri_zagidulin> (one could also use hashlinks, to that HTML)
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> ^
AC: adding the ability to add an outside reference link
P1: alternative hashed link?
<anthony> (this one I'm taking back with me :-))
KL: your example shows a claim with an array of claims, how do 
  you handle the multiple achievements in the claim?
AC: description of diploma supplement
<kerri_lemoie> Anthony's example: 
  https://hackmd.io/D2b4lJTXTgOG1ss4B3payA
AC: want to be able to represent single expresssions as well in 
  the same model
NO: separability of claims?
<deb_everhart> Nate asked my question
<phil_l_(p1)> Might the signature method be able to 'separate out 
  a credential?
AC: massively complex question, technically separating is on the 
  roadmap, other part is to have individual claims and stackability 
  of those claims
P1: self-assertion of a credential?
AC: self-assertion is not within the model
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> "issuer": "did:example:some_random_guy"
AC: use HROpen as a self-assertion model
<deb_everhart> is that the resume portion of HR Open?
KL: how will evidence be used?
AC: evidence is quite controversial
AC: current plan is for evidence to follow OpenBadges
https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#example-23-usage-of-the-evidence-property
AC: actively talking about semi-universal wallet
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> universal-ish
AC: OpenBadges and EuroPass creds in the same wallet
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Juan: +1 to 'universal-ish', great technical 
  term!
<phil_l_(p1)> Does that mean that there is in the current 
  Europass wallet the only type of credential that can be held?
JC: evidence is inside the credentialsubject?
KL: evidence in an OB is different than VC
<nate_otto> OB did intentionally model evidence as a claim about 
  the recipient in our v3 proposal.
<phil_l_(p1)> a video file
KL: can be part of the achievement
<simone> "Uni(contro)versial Wallet" ? (apologies, just trying to 
  match Juan's sharp commentary ;-)
AC: surprised no one has questions about multiple claims?
AC: is this a valid way forward?
DZ: recommend VCs should be short, but realizing there are 
  legislative requrements
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> or resignation
<taylor_(lef)> @JC, Kerri is the antidote to willful OB 
  ignorance. I'm guilty as well :)
DZ: you're hearing acceptance
KL: we're seeing alignment between OB and CLR
<dmitri_zagidulin> I think everyone is hoping that the two 
  approaches will be interchangeable
KL: many cases the credential should be simple, but many that 
  require more complexity
DE: is it as simple as a both/and?
<dmitri_zagidulin> meaning, if you have a bunch of short 
  credentials, that you can bind them into a single larger one. Or, 
  if you have a large multi-claim credential, you can split out 
  claims (using BBS+ etc)
DE: can it be simple and then referenced from the more complex?
<dmitri_zagidulin> (or, if not able to use BBS+ or similar tech, 
  it could be as simple as - ask your issuer for BOTH a large 
  "transcript", and a specific skill credential.
DE: OBv3 and CLR will both support multiple claims?
Phil Long: +1 Dimitri
<anthony> @dmitri that last one is what happens in pratice in 
  many institutions
KL: OBv3 is still a single achievement
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Anthony - makes sense!
AC: issue multiple small credentials and then combining them?
DE: yes oversimplified
<deb_everhart> one important value of that approach is to give 
  people their achievements sooner, along the way to the larger 
  credential
AC: in the transcript you could do a number of small credentials, 
  but there are many use cases that still require multiple claims 
  in a single credential
Kerri Lemoie: +1 Deb
P1: OBv3 as a building block is a great value, complex 
  credentials have a layering with relationships between those 
  claims and sequence of those claims matter
P1: metadata of the relationships is required in the more complex 
  credentials
P1: complex credentials work ahead is the metadata patterning
AC: agreed
<kerri_lemoie> :)
AC: relationships between claims is a key issue, we must describe 
  both approaches
AC: issuer issuing a credential with other relationships and how 
  do you do that?
P1: some organizations wish to have a set of claims as a single 
  package and allow those claims to be expressed as a new set of 
  credentials
AC: topics for next week, multiple languages, guidance on DIDs vs 
  PII, Labeling Skills/learning Outcomes, Micro-credentials and 
  stackability in a VC
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> thanks anthony and marty!
KL: close
