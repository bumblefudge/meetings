<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Benjamin Collins</span>:  And so the two aspects of this which we have to building off of that are traceability interrupt and traceability and drop is defining the API that we have a common language we have a common understanding of a lot of these are going to be exchanged from machine to machine so we have a way that to say hey I&apos;m going to send you these documents or the Sunday sign documents as the specific data type are you ready to receive it those kind of interactions is what we do on the. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Benjamin Collins</span>:  Then on the traceability vocab side of things is more the data model of we&apos;re building the Jason we&apos;re building the schema there&apos;s the specific commercial invoice there&apos;s a specific purchase order their documents and what are the documents how are they framed what shape do they need to be in and all these come in with json-ld out of the box so the scheming forces json-ld in order to have semantics in order to get be able to query over the grass and have. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="comment"><span class="name">Orie Steele</span>:  So I would just add one comment on this piece the traceability vocabulary it can be seen as a as a kind of profile of the verifiable credential specification so it builds on the openness of the verifiable credential specification but it also adds additional requirements that enable interoperability so you know these different rdf classes that Define the types are. <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-182').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-182').show()" id="182" class="comment"><span class="name">Orie Steele</span>:  And data along the way so how do I relate that I started this process requirements changed not have to start a new process and that&apos;s why you see workflow definitions and instances in the traceable presentation as a raise of identifiers because you can group like multiple definitions together by making a presentation that contains both of them and you can do the same thing for instances. <a id="link-182" style="display:none;" href="#182">✪</a></div>
