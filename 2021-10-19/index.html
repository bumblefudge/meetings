We have had report on community member violating code of ethics, specifically harassment of mozilla reps based on positions they have taken. This is NOT acceptable behaviour. I dont think people meant the way your actions came across, but reminder when amplified across the number of people, so please when you engage and i suggest you do be overtly polite. Your comments may be taken in the worst possible way even if you didn&apos;t as tone doesn&apos;t translate over the internet.

<div class="comment-continuation">...: some with the interop out of germany. I know Tim Bouma&apos;s Project is doing interop, the Evernym folks presented as well, about showing interop between the Evernym system and using the W3C DID standard. </div>
<div class="comment-continuation">...: this is where i wanted to talk about the many ecosystems we have the DIF W3C trust over IP, etc etc and many standards orgs, and where are we going to be having the conversations and how will all these orgs be working together? Some are more technical and some are looking to bridge gap between tech and accessibility and so my takeaway is that i think its naive and a dream to think that all these communities would work together. I would love for them to do that but ima realist and the incentives are different and misaligned and that diversity is important. I think rather than try and collect everyone under a tent, and that while ideal in a certain way I think we&apos;re naive if we think we can be successful at it. Curious on other peoples thoughts on this whole idea of interop and ecosystems.</div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I do think there&apos;s lots of truth to what you said, we&apos;ll never get everyone to one interoperability initiative or bubble. Each of these orgs have different priorities and this doesn&apos;t mean we shouldn&apos;t strive for the best. Get as broad interop as we possibly can and keep lines of communication as open as possible between these programs. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>

<div class="information">&lt;mprorock&gt; interop around definite use cases, and sometimes industry verticals can be very helpful - thought sometimes that means working with the big guys if you want to get something broadly adopted, and sometimes that can be difficult for a variety of reasons</div>

I think the community, generally, is making a huge mistake by not highlighting these human rights issues and regulatory capture issues, because i think we have too much at stake in non-tech ways to pretend this is just about crypto <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>

DID: core for example had objectors and we had nothing to point to even if we had considered it for a long time. I expect same issue for human rights will pop up.

The groups were in here and elsewhere, are all technically focused we are not the ethics police in any way shape or form. I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll grab great footholds, to change explicit chartered groups to something different before you go back to your existing work. You&apos;re asking for policing ethics. Which adheres to your ethics which may or may not be what other peoples ethics. Creating of groups that focus on ethics or other peoples ethics. There are doctors who don&apos;t practice as doctors as they look into ethics of treatment patterns or patient pools etc etc. There are concerns there there are other people who carry the ethics baton and suggest that it would be a good idea if every doctor gave an hour a week of pro bono treatment etc. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>

<div class="comment-continuation">...: second opinion is on I&apos;m an invited expert etc. This is not how this community and or w3c works. By doing something you are providing leadership. Concrete example working in w3c i wrote the first 2-3 standards as an invited expert, we didn&apos;t have voting capacity at w3c and it got through the system. tis absolutly possible to get stuff through w3c without being in a leadership position its all about rolling up your sleeve and doing the work.

Additionally while manu is right that anyone can do a work item here, it can be intimidating at first. Speaking from experience, I never did becasue the process seems too much.

<div class="comment-continuation">...: Horizontal review,  any document that goes to the reg track, which means that it is put out to all working groups that exist including privacy and accessibility. to make sure the documents are accessible to anyone who wants to access them. there are ways to build the document to people who are blind. The privacy has understanding of things tha tmost people in tech don&apos;t. This thing you are doing will expose private info as an example. They are there to address the privacy concerns. An ethics or human rights group could easily be a thing, and it needs to have a charter, and its charter might be to review specs and raise concerns. I think this will go a long way to what you are trying to do here.</div>
