<mprorock> MEETING MODERATOR: Michael Prorock <mprorock@mesur.io>
<mahmoud> i can go ahead and do it
mahmoud is scribing.
Mike Prorock:  Scribe + intro + recording started

Topic: Intro/Reintro then announcements.

<manu> oh neat... co-op credentials! :)
Nick Main: Joining as observer excited to work on cooperative 
  credential work. Representing 3 coops and excited and mroe on it 
  later
  ...: Drafting work item will submit shortly
Mproromprorockk: Moving to announcements: handing to manu on 
  ethics and conducts.
Manu Sporny: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Oct/0064.html
Manu Sporny:  As many know Google/Apple/Mozilla objected to DID 
  Core formally. this led to lots of press and lots of twitter 
  musings on motivations. We have had report on community member 
  violating code of ethics, specifically harassment of mozilla reps 
  based on positions they have taken. This is NOT acceptable 
  behaviour. I dont think people meant the way your actions came 
  across, but reminder when amplified across the number of people, 
  so please when you engage and i suggest you do be overtly polite. 
  Your comments may be taken in the worst possible way even if you 
  didn't as tone doesn't translate over the internet. Please take a 
  look at the link above for some tips. it can help you think of 
  best way to engage
Manu Sporny: https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/
Heather Vescent: +1 Manu
Mike Prorock:  Sentiment Echoed.  Next Item is a work item 
  review. As micheal herman is not here we will punt it.
Mike Prorock: +1 Heather - getting some hands on help is always 
  welcome
Heather Vescent:  Still in process of turning the approved Work 
  items into approved Work items, if interested in helping or 
  reviewing, please reach out. hoping to turn it into repos by EOW
Mike Prorock:  Moving to IIW Recap

Topic: IIW Recap

Heather Vescent:  I have a list and will try to talk about a few 
  items and have more people chime in. 
  ...: some with the interop out of germany. I know Tim Bouma's 
  Project is doing interop, the Evernym folks presented as well, 
  about showing interop between the Evernym system and using the 
  W3C DID standard. 
  ...: this is where i wanted to talk about the many ecosystems 
  we have the DIF W3C trust over IP, etc etc and many standards 
  orgs, and where are we going to be having the conversations and 
  how will all these orgs be working together? Some are more 
  technical and some are looking to bridge gap between tech and 
  accessibility and so my takeaway is that i think its naive and a 
  dream to think that all these communities would work together. I 
  would love for them to do that but ima realist and the incentives 
  are different and misaligned and that diversity is important. I 
  think rather than try and collect everyone under a tent, and that 
  while ideal in a certain way I think we're naive if we think we 
  can be successful at it. Curious on other peoples thoughts on 
  this whole idea of interop and ecosystems.
Heather Vescent: +1 To this is normal to have so many groups
Manu Sporny:  I do think there's lots of truth to what you said, 
  we'll never get everyone to one interoperability initiative or 
  bubble. Each of these orgs have different priorities and this 
  doesn't mean we shouldn't strive for the best. Get as broad 
  interop as we possibly can and keep lines of communication as 
  open as possible between these programs.
<by_caballero> xkcd
<by_caballero> most shared xkcd comic of all time
Manu Sporny: https://xkcd.com/927/
Mike Prorock:  I agree, and i think there's definite goals theres 
  the add-age, you start with four standards and get a fifth.
Juan: I was going to say lately the convo in dif interop and DIF 
  generally has focused alot on breaking interop targets down to 
  smaller pieces and larger pieces at the same time. Starting to 
  think about interop across different targets and priorities
  ...: Changing it to be across different Topic, if you want 
  people in the room who know did:comm and presentation exchange 
  and jwt based systems today. I don't think there's a meta-interop 
  worth doing. If you want to prioritize having people who know X 
  or Y i think theres a different place for it
<mprorock> interop around definite use cases, and sometimes 
  industry verticals can be very helpful - thought sometimes that 
  means working with the big guys if you want to get something 
  broadly adopted, and sometimes that can be difficult for a 
  variety of reasons
<identitywoman> woopwoop WACI-PEx
  ...: would recommend looking into the WACI-PEX group
<identitywoman> came out of IIW 32 done by IIW 33!!!
  ...: even when i cochaired that group, and it was aimed at 
  certain targets and product roadmaps or goals.
Agropper: I have the benefit of a huge experience with regulatory 
  capture and interop and standards and trust framework due to my 
  career, and the work we are doing here has huge human rights 
  implications which are second to none, which are not being 
  addressed. I think the community, generally, is making a huge 
  mistake by not highlighting these human rights issues and 
  regulatory capture issues, because i think we have too much at 
  stake in non-tech ways to pretend this is just about crypto
Juan Caballero: +1 To manu, a google doc could be a great start 
  to a CCG work item that helps create a home for those issues!
Mike Prorock:  Acknowledged and agreed as a general principle
Mike Prorock: +1 Manu
Manu Sporny:  I think we as a community have not done a good job 
  about writing about it, so i encourage anyone who thinks we can 
  do better to open a google doc or something to share with others. 
  DID: core for example had objectors and we had nothing to point 
  to even if we had considered it for a long time. I expect same 
  issue for human rights will pop up. I suggest people most 
  passionate about to write down their thoughts so they're 
  reference-able
Mike Prorock:  I know many of us are juggling many roles that 
  affect our companies and these are important issues, and do need 
  definite wokr done aroudn them
Agropper_: saying a google doc would surface is not what im 
  saying per se, I was referring to heathers IIW comments. There 
  needs to be a concerted effort maybe by the chairs to bring the 
  various interop issues into one place, if that is CCG then it can 
  become a work item of some sort. Right now its scattered.
Manu Sporny: +1 To what Mike just said, the only way things get 
  done here is when people step up to do the work.
Mike Prorock: +1 Ted - interest group etc is probably right venue 
  - look forward to your comments
<orie> I'm pretty sure standards is 99% suggesting work for other 
  folks to do sadly... but only people who do work, actually move 
  the standard forward :)
Manu Sporny: +1 To what Heather is saying wrt. do-ocracy.
<manu_sporny> Also, the Chairs aren't Interoperability Gods, as 
  much as I wish that were true. :P
Heather Vescent:  Just want to put support to manus suggestion to 
  create a work item to address these things, best idea is first to 
  write about it. Suggest going for DO-oracy
<mprorock> lol @manu - wouldn't that be nice
<agropper_> Where does leadership come from in CCG?
<manu_sporny> I think the answer is "not only from the Chairs"
  ...: i don't have the energy or motivation to rally those in a 
  volunteer role. maybe DHS or someone can make money on the table 
  to make it happen to make them cooperate, but without some kind 
  of focused incentive, i just don't have lots of faith. Despite 
  how much i love the idea
<heather_vescent> +100 do not volunteer anyone to anyone.
<agropper_> "ethics police" ?
<mprorock> From the CCG Charter - what we are scoped to work on: 
  "The mission of the W3C Credentials Community Group is to explore 
  the creation, storage, presentation, verification, and user 
  control of credentials."
<mprorock> continuing quote: "In general, the topics that are “in 
  scope” include anything related to enabling interoperable 
  credentials on the Web."
Ted Thibodeau:  Do not volunteer anyone else to do something, 
  people get resentful. The groups were in here and elsewhere, are 
  all technically focused we are not the ethics police in any way 
  shape or form. I don't think it'll grab great footholds, to 
  change explicit chartered groups to something different before 
  you go back to your existing work. You're asking for policing 
  ethics. Which adheres to your ethics which may or may not be what 
  other peoples ethics. Creating of groups that focus on ethics or 
  other peoples ethics. There are doctors who don't practice as 
  doctors as they look into ethics of treatment patterns or patient 
  pools etc etc. There are concerns there there are other people 
  who carry the ethics baton and suggest that it would be a good 
  idea if every doctor gave an hour a week of pro bono treatment 
  etc.
Ted Thibodeau:  +1 To enabling interoperable credentials as 
  inherently ethical [scribe assist by Ryan Grant]
Manu Sporny: +1 To what Ted is saying ... it's resonating deeply 
  with me.
Mike Prorock: +1 TallTed
  ...: it is frustrating to me to hear the tech i am working on 
  is ethically lacking, that the work i am doing is ethically 
  lacking and the effor i am doing is lacking. I see enabling 
  interoperability as quite ethical
Heather Vescent: +1 Enabling interop is ethical.
  ...: it opens sphere to people who couldn't afford the access 
  to the bigger things. this is all ethical to me, you may disagree 
  and think otherwise. if you think the W3 is unethical or the CCG 
  is unethical there are paths to resolve that, thats where this 
  stuff should go
<by_caballero> open standards are more ethical than 
  after-the-fact (or royalty-incurring) standards, wherever they 
  happen
@Ted please review my scribe comments
Heather Vescent: +1 Ted. Thank you.
Lots there and not sure if i got it with the correct intention
Mike Prorock:  Big +1. Theres lots of people on the call with 
  varied views on ethics.
<tallted> thanks, Mahmoud, will do
<heather_vescent> Ryan, we have several kinds of work items, they 
  are enumerated here: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/workitem-process/
Ryan Grant:  First of all thanks Ted thats  great. theres some 
  imperfect decentralization in the group. in a perfectly 
  decentralized group all work items would occur without 
  coordination or work from the chairs. We may want to define a few 
  different work items with expectations of reports and 
  coordination. I think heather sees some value in that i think we 
  don't need to burn the chairs with this.
  ...: the CCG could be more scalable if we set expectations for 
  more decentralization most of the time
<heather_vescent> And also described on this slide of the CCG 101 
  deck: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15BfjGKHEski3k1uFh88gNQcSYV0Laemx/edit#slide=id.ga17d661a28_0_22
<heather_vescent> (If you want me to go over the work item types)
Mike Prorock:  We have tackled some of these things, stuff like 
  VC-EDU and other links heather has outlined.
<rgrant> thanks both for the reminders in those links
<manu_sporny> hrm... this is my skeptical face -- I remember a 
  particular thread about "digital slavery" :)
Agropper: i have never implied that the work were doing is 
  unethical to the extent that term was somewhat applied to me or 
  in the positive or negative sense. I think thats inappropriate. 
  what i did raise as an issue is the leadership issue.
<by_caballero> /me scowls in OAuth
<manu_sporny> /me lols
  ...: My point is i am not in a leadership position, I am here 
  for the purpose i hope i am serving which is to point out human 
  rights issues and offer ethical perspectives. The reason i raise 
  this is because the leadership for dealing with these issues is 
  not goign t o come from an invited expert in any of these groups.
Mike Prorock:  In CCG we have no notion of an invited expert, we 
  are open to anyone who wants to join up. Not sure what an invited 
  expert is.
<manu_sporny> W3C Vision: 
  https://github.com/WebStandardsFuture/Vision#introduction
Manu Sporny:  Would like to go back to IIW recap. i did want to 
  point to places where this conversation is going on. there is a 
  W3C vision document, if you have a thought on it riase an issue.
  ...: it talks about the web being for people and individuals, 
  about us and the damage we've caused for the web
Manu Sporny: https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/
Mike Prorock: +1 Manu - no one is saying that ethics aren't 
  important, but that they have a home and are broader reaching 
  than this group - this group is focused on interop around 
  credentials
  ...: and the good things we've done! We have a code of Ethics 
  and Professional Conduct which ahas w3c buyoff. this is not the 
  group to discuss it, there is a group there please provide input 
  there.
<agropper_> This was one of the more popular sessions at IIW: The 
  Self Sovereign Identity Revolution will Not be B2B 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TdpExrGc_98akMmKV3P1Ac5_DmX1EAlaOLdrpSP5VQc/edit
<identitywoman> In terms of Interop moving forward - the German 
  folks who have about 70 projects working on interop in their 
  context are coming to the DIF Interoperability Group next week 
  6am pacific Wednesday - I will be sure to send the information to 
  call in to that to the list - the call is non IPR protected and 
  open to all.
<mprorock> it is about identifying and leading to consensus
Juan Caballero: +1
  ...: second opinion is on I'm an invited expert etc. This is 
  not how this community and or w3c works. By doing something you 
  are providing leadership. Concrete example working in w3c i wrote 
  the first 2-3 standards as an invited expert, we didn't have 
  voting capacity at w3c and it got through the system. tis 
  absolutly possible to get stuff through w3c without being in a 
  leadership position its all about rolling up your sleeve and 
  doing the work. Having said that i appreciate your input and 
  current work you're doing. im not saying that to diminish the 
  work you're doing
<by_caballero> super-connecters are vital in this decentralized 
  topography
  ...: i don't want people to get the false impression you are 
  powerless. Pick up a pen and start writing
Heather Vescent:  I liked a lot of what you said, i put links for 
  work items and types of work items. We have a bucket for whatever 
  type of item you want t owork on, if you're not sure what kind of 
  item it is come to me. Additionally while manu is right that 
  anyone can do a work item here, it can be intimidating at first. 
  Speaking from experience, I never did becasue the process seems 
  too much. If thats how you feel I am happy to shepherd you 
  through this process, being a lead in it and so its setup for 
  success so yo ucan navigate the process as a chair.
<manu_sporny> Yes, agreed, the process can be intimidating... 
  working with the sorts of people at W3C (literally the people 
  that invented the Internet and the Web) can be intimidating... 
  and they're people, and a lot of them are really super nice 
  people that want to help you succeed.
<mprorock> honestly engage with PING etc
<manu_sporny> Yes, exactly ^^^ PING would be a good place to 
  start
  ...: specifically to your comments I sincerely appreciate your 
  perspective, I think what you want to do is thought leadership. I 
  might invite you to start writing about this as folks have 
  suggested, or find some folks that are likeminded or opposite of 
  yours to collaborate on a document. you can have this be a CCG 
  work item or not a work item. We can release that as a 
  commentary.
Mike Prorock:  Echoing sentiment, reach out to all chairs. Happy 
  to discuss. Orie shepherded me through a few of those and still 
  does.
<tallted> 1. Leadership comes from within, more by example than 
  anything else.
<tallted> 2. Ethical action includes paying attention to "human 
  rights" concerns, as part of a universe of concerns.
<tallted> 3. Horizontal review of W3 work would include the 
  groups Manu points to, and that might be the best path to getting 
  specific human rights or other concerns addressed by any given 
  spec (cf Privacy WG, Accessibility WG, among others)
<orie> I giveth TallTed the title of Chief Process Officer :)
Heather Vescent: +1
Mike Prorock: +1 Orie - so it is written
<mprorock> so say we all
<orie> sry have to drop
Ted Thibodeau:  Leadership comes from within, from each of us and 
  the group, you may notice I have no title relevant to CCG, the 
  best way to lead is to lead by example, if you write an ethics 
  based document, it will either get buy in or it wont, if it does, 
  we're on the same page, either your work is clear or theres a 
  discussion that can happen.
<manu_sporny> Is Ted a leader in the community -- absolutely -- 
  by leading by example, the only part of any title we care about 
  here is "what part of the process is the person with that title 
  expected to execute"... and it ends pretty much there.
Mike Prorock: +1 Tall
Mike Prorock: +1 TallTed - horiz review is highly important - 
  PING hits a lot of these topics directly and is a part of that 
  process
  ...: Horizontal review,  any document that goes to the reg 
  track, which means that it is put out to all working groups that 
  exist including privacy and accessibility. to make sure the 
  documents are accessible to anyone who wants to access them. 
  there are ways to build the document to people who are blind. The 
  privacy has understanding of things tha tmost people in tech 
  don't. This thing you are doing will expose private info as an 
  example. They are there to address the privacy concerns. An 
  ethics or human rights group could easily be a thing, and it 
  needs to have a charter, and its charter might be to review specs 
  and raise concerns. I think this will go a long way to what you 
  are trying to do here.
Mike Prorock:  Echoing that the privacy group or PING, thats 
  probably where you want to be engaging it doesn't mean its not 
  important but each of these groups have a focus, ours is a 
  interop around credentials. as a group our goal is to move those 
  items forward
<heather_vescent> Adrian - believe me I know how difficult this 
  community is for non-tech people.
Agropper: ill just say that you have no idea how unlikely it is 
  for this group, given how much of a tech focus you have to be 
  able to inclusive of non-tech perspective, i hae reachedc out to 
  critics, and the people that would represent diversity of opinion 
  of this and many other groups always without exception refuse to 
  participate because of the structure.
<mprorock> lol @Heather - you absolutely have fought that uphill 
  battle
<identitywoman> what regulatory capture are you worried about?
<heather_vescent> that's not what we are saying Adrian. We are 
  saying to put your concerns in words and push publish somewhere 
  on the interenet.
Apgropper: i constantly try to engage with a more diverse 
  audience, sure you can look to PING but to tell me all i have to 
  do is look for a charter, you are not hearing what I have to say 
  about reg capture and leadership of DHS. you're just not hearing 
  me
<bobwyman> What is the alternative to writing a charter?
Heather Vescent: Reminder: next week is TPAC presentation
Agropper: folks are here for a particular reason which is B2B.
<identitywoman> You should take the advice that people are giving 
  you - write it down and make it clearer
<mprorock> strongly disagree as well
<heather_vescent> And community, do we want to give space to 
  recap IIW again in a future meeting?
<by_caballero> i too would work somewhere better-paying if I 
  cared less than 100% about human rights
Heather Vescent: +1 Juan
Ted Thibodeau: +1 To IIW review next week
<by_caballero> there have certainly been better-paying offers
<identitywoman> Have you sat down and looked Anil in the eyes and 
  talked with him?
<mprorock> time note FYI
<heather_vescent> Ted, next week is TPAC presentation, but maybe 
  we can also spend some time on IIW, after we finish that deck.
<heather_vescent> noted Mike. Today has been on fire lol.
Ted Thibodeau: +1 IIW review in nearish-future meeting :-)
<identitywoman> I've been talking to the ACLU for years - they 
  are positively inclined to the VC work
Mike Prorock: +1 Identity
Manu Sporny:  I hear you and disagree very strong. We started our 
  company to change the way our tech is being used, its upsetting 
  to hear motives being impugned. Giving you benefit of doubt that 
  it isn't what you're intending. 
Adrian Gropper:  I'm not here for B2B. I'm here to find ways to 
  empower people to exercise their rights. We're not all in thrall 
  to corporate interests. [scribe assist by Bob Wyman]
Mike Prorock: +1 Bob
Heather Vescent: +1 Ted
<mprorock> getting tired of quoting this btw - but - 
  https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/
Ted Thibodeau:  This is going to be pointed and focused at 
  adrian. Stop impugning peoples motivations. You have a particular 
  perspective on the world, and the way you present it makes me not 
  want to hear it, where i don't want to see your name on an email 
  and a pull request etc. and I'm sick of it, you're not an invited 
  expert you're here as a community member. Community groups are 
  different, our motivation is different. Even there are not 
  strictly financial. The hours we put on this is not revenue 
  generating, its not intended to be. It is insulting to suggest 
  otherwise.
<by_caballero> /me <3
<manu_sporny> Thanks all! :)
<by_caballero> still recording btw
Manu Sporny: +1 To talking about IIW stuff, please start thread 
  with items.
