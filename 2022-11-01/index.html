<div onmouseout="$('#link-186').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-186').show()" id="186" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Feature by feature and the reason that at least we do that is because we don&apos;t feel like there is going to be one platform or one open source Library or one anything that&apos;s going to be able to achieve the support that the market needs every organization has has their preferences around programming environment and programming language and so you know I think you&apos;re going to have to support many different open source packages that effectively do the same thing but in different. <a id="link-186" style="display:none;" href="#186">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-189').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-189').show()" id="189" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  So this is one of the key questions I think and the way we are trying to answer that question is basically by saying first of all how you know what are the building blocks that we believe as a community are important and some of them will overlap some of them may be pretty unique but what are those building blocks step number two understand what is the available code base and can we simply use that code or is there work to. <a id="link-189" style="display:none;" href="#189">✪</a></div>

<div class="information">&lt;orie&gt; Part of the answer is, we can&apos;t advocate for a building block we don&apos;t know exists, which is why we are gathering active projects and reviewing them together now.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-191').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-191').show()" id="191" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  And then to understand what is work that is happily done by community members the basic theory is that the open Wallet foundation will play as a foundation the smallest role possible but wherever there are gaps we need to identify those gaps so my hunch and it&apos;s just a hunch is that there will be areas where there&apos;s probably a lot of code and maybe even a lot of developers and there may be other areas. <a id="link-191" style="display:none;" href="#191">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-192').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-192').show()" id="192" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:   That we all feel are. <a id="link-192" style="display:none;" href="#192">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-193').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-193').show()" id="193" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  Really critical and important to address but there&apos;s probably not a lot of code and not a lot of developers and not a lot of companies that are interested to do something and this is an area where I believe we need to do exactly what you suggest namely to ensure that there are funds available that can be used to entice people to provide important work that no one else would do otherwise. <a id="link-193" style="display:none;" href="#193">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-194').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-194').show()" id="194" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  So this is not a perfect answer I cannot give you a dollar amount and I cannot tell you exactly what that work is going to be but I can and want to invite you and everyone else on this call as well as anyone else who you think should be part of the conversation that isn&apos;t all ready to weigh in and try to identify what can be done by the community and where we will have gaps and what the required funding is to address those gaps. <a id="link-194" style="display:none;" href="#194">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-197').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-197').show()" id="197" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Buchner</span>:  And we&apos;ve by the way changed that so when I say that we&apos;re looking for for feedback we started initially with a model or with the idea that most of the development would be done by the foundation itself and we saw quite a bit of interest from different companies to provide and donate code as well as developers and and basically change the model a little bit to say well if there is an area where we can. <a id="link-197" style="display:none;" href="#197">✪</a></div>
