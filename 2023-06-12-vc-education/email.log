Kerri Lemoie:  There it is.\

Topic: IP Note\

<kerri_lemoie> I think Simone isn't getting recorded by the 
  transcriber.\
<kerri_lemoie> We'll look into this\
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> I think it's 
  not just Simone\

Topic: Call Notes\

<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> Probably 
  need to stop and restart...\

Topic: Introductions & Reintroductions\

Kerri Lemoie:  So now I queued\myself up I'm honestly this is 
  Carrie Lemoie\folks I'm just kidding myself up to see if the 
  transcriber is still working.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Not see it work out there so it is working for me 
  but okay.\
Kerri Lemoie:  It's your voice I don't know sure what it is but 
  okay thank you.\

Topic: Announcements & Reminders\

Kerri Lemoie: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed-use-cases/#enrollment\
Kerri Lemoie:  This is a real announcement not to suggest one I 
  was going to be starting a special topic group IV C Ed you and I 
  did like to invite all of you to to join this discussion has to 
  do with enrollment status we do have a use case IVC a do for 
  enrollment link to it right here I think this use case could 
  actually be updated for enrollment not just to be car.\
Kerri Lemoie:   And enrollment but.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Rolled or graduated but there's a lot of like use 
  cases it seems in the consumption of credentials where employers 
  just want to know if somebody is enrolled and also their use 
  cases where students who are enrolled whether high school or 
  secondary or even some other program outside of the formal step 
  could use that for you know other reasons right.\
Kerri Lemoie:   Off the top of my.\
Kerri Lemoie: https://forms.gle/iKrf1no42FsEr3XG6\
Kerri Lemoie:  Students who are enrolled may get discounts while 
  they're enrolled in school it's a pretty common one but it's 
  turning out that this is like globally something that is 
  necessary and may not be too difficult for us to start with like 
  sort of an easy data model for it and discuss ways that this 
  could be implemented in a simple way where these key issue dust 
  in a simple way so what I've done is I've created a form of 
  Interest form only put a link to it in the chat for you all.\
Kerri Lemoie:   Right here.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Like right there is the billing to just a Google 
  form just just for a contact info and then I will reach out and 
  we can figure out a time to meet to have this first discussion 
  and take it from there we can talk about you know how to use rely 
  on existing standards do we need to come up with something new 
  you know just just to have these discussions and talk about all 
  of these cases that we can think of so I welcome you to join us.\
Kerri Lemoie:   Hopefully this is something that moves pretty 
  quickly and we could maybe move through it.\
Kerri Lemoie:  He's out in the fall because anybody have any 
  questions about this.\
Nader Helmy:  Thank you Simone a can everyone hear me okay.\
Nader Helmy:  Perfect thank you very much for the invite as as 
  someone I said I'm later he'll me I'm from a company called 
  matter and I'm just going to share my screen here let me know 
  when you can see it.\
Nader Helmy:  Perfect yes I'm from a company called matter which 
  is based in New Zealand I'm a product strategist there but today 
  I'm going to be talking as someone I said about the my creds 
  national network in Canada specifically what is the approach that 
  we took when it came to kind of designing an interoperable 
  education solution what we've learned along the way and then sort 
  of what kind of some some insights and potential next steps might 
  be very.\
Nader Helmy:   Areas-- to get the feedback from the people in 
  this.\
Nader Helmy:  Um around all of that and really want to engage 
  with the broader Community around what we've done with my creds.\
Simone Ravaoli: https://mycreds.ca/\
Nader Helmy:  So starting off like what is my creds to begin with 
  my creds is a national shared service in platform in Canada that 
  offers essentially a what's called a learner credential wallet 
  that gives students and Learners access to their academic records 
  now my creds kind of proceeds the the idea of verifiable 
  credentials and the the kind of work that's happened lately so 
  there's a new.\
Nader Helmy:   Native within my cred.\
Nader Helmy:  All the virtual skills Pratt passport or the VSP as 
  you might see a refer to for short which is essentially kind of 
  more of a decentralized identity solution with a digital wallet 
  that allows people to kind of you know own their data around 
  their academic records and present it to relying parties in an 
  indirect way kind of the typical issuer verifier holder model 
  that were probably familiar with in this group so that's what we 
  did with the virtual.\
Nader Helmy:   Is passport we being on the bottom there you'll 
  see digit Airy.\
Nader Helmy:  Men as well as.\
Simone Ravaoli: 
  https://mycreds.ca/2023/03/31/ten-ontario-post-secondary-institutions-issue-verifiable-micro-credentials-through-the-virtual-skills-passport-pilot-project/\
Nader Helmy:  Matter so we'll kind of talk a little bit about how 
  we collaborated to bring that to life the other major stakeholder 
  on this project is a rug which is the association of registrar's 
  and universities and colleges in Canada and this is really you 
  know a broader organization across Canada that works to advance 
  the educational goals of the of the Canadian kind of citizenry 
  more broadly and my creds like I said.\
Nader Helmy:   Is the project that kind of where all this has 
  culminated and where we're.\
Nader Helmy:  Piloting the use of digital credentials in a kind 
  of new way that sort of complements the existing system and in 
  many ways so it's kind of a hybrid solution so kind of the next 
  few slides will explain a bit around what that actually means so 
  the way that we're involved as I mentioned so matter products 
  provide what we call building blocks for verifiable data and 
  digital trust ecosystems so this covers.\
Nader Helmy:   The typical kind of issue verify hold trust try.\
Nader Helmy:  No that I mentioned before as well as the other 
  layer of what we call ecosystem operations which are necessary to 
  create secure and trusted interactions right so an ecosystem 
  needs to communicate things like what are the common schemas that 
  are being used that are being trusted how are issuers and bed and 
  verifiers and other stakeholders kind of vetted or certified you 
  know what are the expectations and rules and even down to like 
  very basic things like kind of what standards do we greet.\
Nader Helmy:   To use all the way up to kind of business logic 
  and specific.\
Nader Helmy:  Things like revocation and backup and recovery and 
  that sort of thing so it's a big kind of interconnected web of 
  choices right that that needs to be made in order to bring a 
  verifiable credential or a digital credential ecosystem to life 
  and I guess part of the that that process part of facilitating 
  trust in an ecosystem is as I mentioned the process of developing 
  Open Standards especially around what is the data that's being 
  represented and how is it being.\
Nader Helmy:   Conveyed and then how is it understood so these 
  are kind of very basic.\
Nader Helmy:  Turns out very hard to get right in a play in an 
  area like education which is so diverse right and fragmented in 
  many ways in terms of like the global approach to managing data 
  its there's a really wide range there so you know we're you know 
  excited about what we've built with my creds we think it has you 
  know some advantages to like physical documents but again.\
Nader Helmy:   It's that approach offers a.\
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> Link to this 
  deck?\
Nader Helmy:  Is kind of digitally native way to convey this 
  information that's easy to share and convenient and we think 
  provides like a good value proposition alongside the way that 
  Learners engage with their academic records today so digitarium 
  matter are both the technology Partners on this my creds VSP 
  provide a platform and capabilities for my creds digital 
  credentials.\
Nader Helmy:  I am how are you this is not showing up for you 
  guys.\
Nader Helmy:  Okay but you can see the whole power that of all 
  right an ideal but that's okay so so this is this is what I was 
  the slide that I was talking about for the last few minutes or so 
  and this was just the first one that I flipped from.\
Nader Helmy:  So my creds are a look did you Terry matter virtual 
  skills passport and then the kind of solution that we built here 
  so how do our credentials work on a very high level essentially 
  digit Airy offers a platform where academic credentials are 
  issued by institutions into a digitally sign like they're issued 
  as digitally signed PDFs into.\
Nader Helmy:   To a students account.\
Nader Helmy:  Which is this which is the my creds platform so 
  they'll log into the my creds platform and will be able to view 
  and interact with and share these digitally signed PDFs now what 
  kind of matter has built as an integration essentially is that 
  when students log into their microbes account there will be an 
  option for them to download the credential to their digital 
  wallet so this is a you know a separate thing that appears in 
  their account and the student if they consent and opt in.\
Nader Helmy:   Then they download the the matter wallet and then 
  the VC is created an issue to their wallet.\
Nader Helmy:  Which they can.\
Nader Helmy:  Only use so it's this it's the system we're 
  technically you know for those users who for whatever reason you 
  know maybe they don't have a smartphone or maybe they don't have 
  access to that the infrastructure or potentially for a myriad of 
  other reasons they are they don't want to or unable to use the 
  digital the verifiable credential option then they just kind of 
  use the the microts platform as it exists today with those 
  digitally sign PDFs but if they opt.\
Nader Helmy:   Opt-in then they kind of get this the benefits of 
  this additional.\
<simone_ravaioli> Link to the MyCreds Learner journey 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BK6n9PdFG0\
Nader Helmy:  Credential journey in which enables them to do 
  things like you know Port that data across context and share it 
  on the web and early easy and kind of convenient fashion which is 
  slightly more challenging with the existing system so I won't 
  play it right this minute maybe we can go back at the end if so 
  if we have time or you know will send this deck out as well but 
  there's a whole video that kind of shows what the my creds learn 
  our journey is.\
Nader Helmy:   Kind of a.\
Nader Helmy:  Planes essentially what I just described but in a 
  much more Vivid detail with the actual UI ux that learner would 
  see throughout that process.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah thanks money High later when question I have 
  always here is about the digital signing budgetary and maybe some 
  only plans for this to how how are the kids managed is there's 
  did you carry sign on behalf of the participating institutions or 
  are you managing all of their keys separately like how are you 
  doing that in the system.\
Nader Helmy:  Smart I do want to take this one away.\
<david_baumgartner@smarteduwallet> Who is the customer for 
  MyCreds accounts? It is the student, or the issuing institution?\
Nader Helmy:  So that yes so from I think from the verifiable 
  credential perspective we offer basically the matter 7 platform 
  is like a SAS platform I'm multi-talented stats platform so 
  essentially that's what we exposed to digit Airy and so each 
  really each institution each issue or has a separate tenant with 
  a separate D ID and add a document and and kind of like.\
Nader Helmy:   Their own identity in the in the system right so.\
<simone_ravaioli> @David, Post-secondary Institutions in Canada\
<david_baumgartner@smarteduwallet> Following up: Who is the 
  customer for MyCreds accounts? It is the student, or the issuing 
  institution?  In other words, who pays for the account?\
Nader Helmy:  How how we do it but again that that would be kind 
  of separate from I think the potentially the question I think 
  Kerry is sort of for the for the digitally sign PDFs portion how 
  are the keys how are the keys managed and I believe the way that 
  they're managed is that like essentially yeah did you Terry would 
  kind of sign on behalf of Institutions but in a very similar way 
  where they all have kind of separate public.\
Nader Helmy:   Keys and are identifiable within the.\
Nader Helmy:  In the ecosystem I could be wrong on that but 
  someone it is that that ring that is a seem to resonate.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah and it was hard I want to hold us up I was 
  actually speaking about how a matter does it is so the you're 
  just managing the tenants need to tenant for the issuer contains 
  all the key information for them then you're you're just handling 
  that at matter.\
<simone_ravaioli> Institutions pay to onboard onto MyCreds\
Nader Helmy:  Yeah so essentially okay yeah yeah the that when 
  when an API is called so like when they're in the my creds 
  platform and they choose to opt into this you know this Dental 
  the credential to your digital wallet option it'll essentially 
  kind of call our API right and an Arabic API will return the the 
  credential signed by the the issuer's tenant so whatever college 
  or university is like.\
Nader Helmy:   Sponsible for that Learners record.\
Simone Ravaoli: https://mycreds.ca/learners/faqs/\
Nader Helmy:  And yeah and then essentially you know using that 
  that system the the credential gets issued so that the the key 
  management happens on the matter platform as well.\
Nader Helmy:  Yep so I guess one on the explain a little bit 
  around so why we think centers are important and and kind of what 
  the approach is behind that I think you know it may be familiar 
  to some of the folks in this room but I think fundamentally we 
  believe that building on top of Open Standards is the way the 
  kind of meet people where they are and Foster transparency both.\
Nader Helmy:   Perrin C and.\
Nader Helmy:  Action in an ecosystem so as mentioned earlier this 
  means kind of defining you know a whole bunch of common you know 
  standards and rules amongst those are things like how data is 
  actually represented how it's secured and then how users can 
  authenticate with that data and more so what we're really looking 
  for with my creds specifically the microbes virtual skills 
  passport was a way to have like a digitally native.\
Nader Helmy:   Of Education record that could be defined.\
Nader Helmy:  Using open data vocabularies so that was a big kind 
  of design goal right partially because I think fundamentally that 
  process of what these digital education records look like is is 
  collaborative and is multi-stakeholder so like having that need 
  to build something with an open data vocabulary was a big design 
  goal as mentioned so ultimately the the virtual skills passport 
  was.\
Nader Helmy:   Built to support.\
Nader Helmy:  Debbie 33 verifiable credentials with the schema 
  being represented using json-ld so again kind of separate from 
  the proof format layer but at the very least with the schema 
  layer that it was a json-ld credential and we've kind of linked 
  off to the GitHub we can find the the broader documentation here 
  but specifically getting into what the credentials are and and 
  how they show up we defined the Jason Aldean.\
Nader Helmy:  See which is known in the my creds ecosystem as a 
  micro credential I'm like put that in quotes because a lot of 
  like a you know and we'll get it in this the next couple slides 
  but they're you know is a really wide range of things in the 
  broader Global education space that get referred to as on my 
  credential and that is the case with a lot of these different 
  terms in the education space so I'll turn.\
Nader Helmy:   Native credentials digital credentials you know.\
Nader Helmy:  You know learner wallets things like that they all 
  get used in education space but often times to refer to a really 
  broad range of of actual kind of Technologies and implementations 
  so we'll get into that in a minute in terms of how we 
  specifically you know want to tackle that problem but but 
  essentially it is a micro credential in the my creds Network and 
  what this vocabulary is really.\
Nader Helmy:   Based on its adjacent only vocab but it's based 
  on.\
Nader Helmy:  Action of these pests which is the post-secondary 
  education kind of Standards body there XML standards for college 
  transcripts and academic credentials so we've linked to them here 
  but these are existing credentials that in North America are 
  widely used to to a very large extent and so there was I think a 
  very practical this is.\
Nader Helmy:   Just driven from very.\
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> CTDL definition of micro 
  credential and its related linked data structure 
  https://credreg.net/ctdl/terms/MicroCredential#MicroCredential\
Nader Helmy:  It to kind of design something on the digital 
  credential side that would actually be used and would immediately 
  be useful to all these institutions who had already adopted these 
  existing pesky XML standard so we wanted to bring them along on 
  the journey and and design this kind of next-gen experience in 
  this was our attempt to do that and so we defined a vocabulary 
  which is open source and you can find it here.\
Nader Helmy:  Is linked to in the in this GitHub repo as well so 
  this this is a you know a public vocab but really I don't think 
  it's been you know probably shared two widely outside of the my 
  creds ecosystem in some kind of education conferences and things 
  like that so we really wanted to bring it to you know we wanted 
  to bring it to frankly to the crowd of people who are you know 
  already working on verifiable credentials for Education are 
  invested.\
Nader Helmy:   And care about this space.\
Nader Helmy:  Not that those other areas of Engagement with other 
  kinds of stakeholders aren't great but we think that this would 
  be the place to actually.\
Nader Helmy:  These ideas kind of in a slightly more efficient 
  fashion and also that to iterate quickly you know we believe that 
  there is.\
Nader Helmy:  Part of this approach that we've taken let us to 
  you know really taking a really broad look at what was out there 
  and.\
Nader Helmy:  With you know the landscape of Education 
  credentials and trying to create a map of sort of what is 
  happening and who's using wide and and and like what the 
  different layers are and We've Come Away with a very sort of 
  complex picture but one that we're hoping today we can sort of we 
  can sort of Challenge and cut through the noise a little bit 
  around you know what what might be a good balance between these 
  different trade-offs.\
Nader Helmy:  This is essentially what we've built and and you 
  can find the links here.\
Nader Helmy:  I guess kind of getting into that idea of what the 
  challenges are we've divided them into like five categories here 
  so we just wanted to talk about each of them for a moment and 
  like why why they make the you know converging on a comic 
  academic record or digital credential why they make that so 
  difficult right so I think there's like a lot of complexity here 
  but from the very start there's there is a lot of.\
Nader Helmy:  Virgins around what the what the data in a 
  credentials even meant to be modeling in the first place so is it 
  simple is it complex is it sort of atomic or more dynamically 
  updated and then like what actually is the credential so is it a 
  course is it a skill is it a transcript is it a diploma is it 
  something else so that's kind of maybe the obvious one but the 
  very big one where there is no clear consensus you know looking.\
Nader Helmy:   Looking at the global kind of education space 
  around what the data is meant to be.\
Nader Helmy:  This also kind of you know challenges around what 
  the underlying technology technology being used for the data 
  representation side right so look how does the data actually show 
  up is in machine readable and like you know what what can consume 
  it and you know for everything from XML to Json to be seized and 
  more there's also like and this kind of gets to the the trust 
  architecture.\
Nader Helmy:   Discussion a bit and there's no real consensus 
  around.\
Nader Helmy:  A lives and how its managed so you know what is 
  what is the actual architecture is it something that is 
  user-centric where they have control and autonomy to maybe share 
  an exercise their data sharing rights independently of an 
  institution or is it institution Centric where potentially you 
  know all of that data sharing lives on an institutions 
  Platformers managed and facilitated by them right so you have a 
  whole range of things in here everything from paper documents to 
  web portal.\
Nader Helmy:   Those two Central databases to digital wallets to 
  decentralize data.\
Nader Helmy:  It seemed like everything.\
Nader Helmy:  Between so that's you know pretty pretty broad 
  range of things we're actually talking about there.\
Nader Helmy:  There's kind of what standards are being conformed 
  to and that which layer right so we have all these different 
  standards in education space that are intended for kind of oh in 
  many cases overlapping but also distinct kinds of data so 
  everything from clrs to open badges feces pest standards HR Open 
  Standards europass learning model and kind of a whole bunch of 
  stuff in between.\
Nader Helmy:   So I think that is it.\
Nader Helmy:  You kind of clear pressing the Eid which is that 
  you know there is you know we've seen and recent years the that 
  you know obviously this is nothing terribly new to some of the 
  folks in this group and we've seen progress right like with 
  things like see Lars and open badges with CRV to open badge b3u 
  kind of adopting a more VC like approach or at least attempting 
  to try to converge with that approach a bit.\
Nader Helmy:   And and creating Provisions within those 
  standards.\
Nader Helmy:  Will to be.\
Nader Helmy:  This is VCS but they're still clearly a gap right 
  and there's still a gap in terms of the oh like connecting the 
  the overarching efforts of these different groups in a coherent 
  way they still kind of tell now remain largely speaking kind of 
  generalizing a bit like as independent parallel tracks right so 
  that is a challenge.\
Nader Helmy:   And then.\
Nader Helmy:  To finally not finally there there also you know a 
  whole raft of other kinds of challenges but in terms of these 
  main ones whether or not there is a digital security layer right 
  and how the data is secured if so so you know a whole wide range 
  here about is the data tamper evident at all is there a Content 
  Integrity layer is their origin authenticity is they're both of 
  those things so you know everything from digital signatures.\
Nader Helmy:   No QR codes and Seaboard based.\
Nader Helmy:  Credential representations like collect data proves 
  jots the selector disclosure jwt's there's a whole kind of raft 
  of competing things in this area and so that's another challenge 
  and looking at these challenges we wanted to we didn't think we 
  could address all of them to be frank but we think we thought we 
  could partially try to address.\
Nader Helmy:   Some of them primarily like.\
Nader Helmy:  Let's get some.\
Nader Helmy:  Common like the idea of what the data is meant to 
  be modeling in the first place I think in on the sort of spectrum 
  of simple to complex I think one of the key insights that we've 
  had from working in this education space is the idea that there 
  are so many stakeholders in education and there's such wildly 
  different ecosystems and.\
Nader Helmy:   Ian's in that.\
Nader Helmy:  Kind of global landscape and they're all driven by 
  very valid and like practical concerns right so at the very 
  simplest level like there's differences in you know different 
  jurisdictions and how they approach these problems but even kind 
  of beyond that there's so much going on in terms of like 
  education's connection to you know the global economy and like 
  what that enables and because of that there's just such.\
Nader Helmy:   Such a wide range.\
Nader Helmy:  I've stuff out there but I think the the Insight in 
  that is that.\
Nader Helmy:  To trying to standardize or create a standard 
  around something that's really complex.\
Nader Helmy:  Is probably not the best way to go in the education 
  space.\
Nader Helmy:  As the more complexity that that this this object 
  has the harder becomes four different institutions and 
  stakeholders to to buy in and adopt that thing and and then 
  you're also trying at the same time the more complex it gets 
  you're trying to cater this digital document or its digital 
  credential to be kind of everything to everyone right and and 
  that doesn't really scale and that's I think why.\
Nader Helmy:   It's so challenging to.\
Nader Helmy:  To education stakeholders in our room and agree 
  like that you know that this this is what we should be issuing 
  and this is what we should be exchanging and using as something 
  with meaning in our ecosystems so again kind of presenting this 
  this humbly from appreciate that definitely it is an outsider 
  perspective because we're we're fundamentally a technology 
  company right we're not like matter is a technology company and 
  did you Terry.\
Nader Helmy:   As well.\
Nader Helmy:  But we're we're not kind of wetted specifically to 
  the education space but after kind of engaging and being in the 
  space for a while now and really kind of taking a look at the 
  landscape that is you know one of the things that emerge for us 
  was that idea of Simplicity over complexity and what if we could 
  what if we could all agree on something very simple and very like 
  basic that could then be the could then be.\
Nader Helmy:   Be connected and.\
<phil_barker> I love these comments on how diverse the education 
  ecosystem is, and the implications for that.\
Nader Helmy:  And sort of cumae accumulated and in different ways 
  depending on an different stakeholders needs right so like 
  something simple that can be that inbuilt into something more 
  complex as needed but fundamentally the thing that should be the 
  target sort of for interoperability it seems like is something 
  that is very basic and simple right something Atomic and and that 
  can be exchanged and understood with.\
Nader Helmy:   Without a lot of overhead right so that that is 
  that the.\
Nader Helmy:  Sick proposition there.\
Nader Helmy:  The next one is kind of you know what is the 
  technology for data representation I think we've seen a lot of 
  Promise in and Jason Aldean as like as a semantic kind of 
  vocabulary layer and verifiable credentials clearly as the the 
  envelope kind of make a lot of sense as well so I'm just kind of 
  drawing some lines in the sand there and saying hey.\
Nader Helmy:   Here's the.\
Nader Helmy:  Using kind of as a default and we think that that 
  that one isn't terribly controversial depending on sort of who 
  you are but we're hoping in this in this group that that's 
  hopefully not too controversial and then finally tagged trying to 
  again not fully solve these problems but at least partially 
  tackle this idea of this the standards Conformity and like 
  cutting through the noise of all these standards that exist in 
  trying to find.\
Nader Helmy:   And trying to build something that we think 
  leverages the best of.\
Nader Helmy:  And so yeah and so any questions at this stage 
  because we're going to talk a bit about what this all means or 
  what we think kind of we should do about this of.\
Nader Helmy:  Okay perfect yeah.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Actually I wait till the Q&A aren't you kind of 
  trip meter and we can all discuss thank you.\
Nader Helmy:  Cool yeah awesome so what does this mean what do we 
  do about this we're we think with a few simple and concise goals 
  that that there's an opportunity here to cut through some of the 
  noise and develop something which is simple and collaboratively 
  constructed and and kind of Builds on the best practices for 
  standards conformance that are out there today so.\
Nader Helmy:   Sort of in.\
Nader Helmy:  Of kind of their importance to the approach is the 
  first is kind of leveraging the past XML standards which are 
  widely in use today as inspiration for the semantics and utility 
  of the credential so according to the national student 
  Clearinghouse there were over 14 million pests college 
  transcripts issued over the last five years which is huge it's 
  some significant adoption right I think obviously the caveat here 
  is that this is largely in North.\
Nader Helmy:   Ah but the.\
Nader Helmy:  Kind of adoption and utility around around the 
  stuff in essentially what we did with the micro credentials vocab 
  which is again open source was essentially leverage these pecs 
  XML standards to to create what we think is pretty pretty simple 
  vocab if you go in there you'll see like it is not terribly 
  complex right but it was kind of the end it's a kind of a flat 
  structure as well it's not like a lot of times you'll see in 
  the.\
Nader Helmy:  Typically with json-ld vocabs in this space like a 
  lot of really complex uses of json-ld and nesting and different 
  types and and kind of like potentially like a potentially 
  over-engineered a bit right like is what you're seeing and a lot 
  of these places and we've tried to build something which we think 
  is you know doesn't try to boil the ocean but it's kind of simple 
  right answer this simple pasta simplest possible representation 
  of what.\
Nader Helmy:   These standards are that are in use today that the 
  second pillar of.\
Nader Helmy:  On top of the micro credentials guidance that is 
  being provided currently by legislators lawmakers and experts 
  around the world around what data elements should be included in 
  a micro credential I think the subtext for this for those who are 
  fully aware is that is that my credentials are like a Hot Topic 
  right in the education space kind of separate from VCS and 
  digital credentials and and that whole thing like micro 
  credentials are something that our institutions are already 
  invested.\
Nader Helmy:   Din for various reasons including Financial but 
  also.\
Nader Helmy:  Is kind of.\
Nader Helmy:  Wave and education around this idea of kind of 
  single assertion credentials right and and there's nothing about 
  I mean there's a lot of implementations on micro credentials that 
  are not what would someone would call decentralized or self 
  Sovereign right if you know if you know what I mean like a lot of 
  them are kind of hosted and managed by institutions but at the 
  same time there is this push right like around what am I gonna 
  credential is and institutions and experts in.\
Nader Helmy:   Acres trying to like figure out what the.\
Nader Helmy:  Like possible representation would be for what 
  they're looking for and so there's a lot of guidance out there 
  that we can draw on and this is I think an area that digit Harry 
  about parchment has a lot of expertise and an a background in so 
  kind of leveraging that guidance and then finally is is sort of 
  synthesizing together these different json-ld vocabs that are 
  being built by the community so we can all hopefully kind of come 
  together and and model a simple my credential.\
Nader Helmy:   Oh and the whole concept of my.\
Nader Helmy:  Like I mentioned earlier is that is a single 
  assertion credential I think one of the big winds that we could 
  potentially do very early on is to try to essentially try to make 
  that vocab that we're working on converge with or contain the 
  simplest elements of an open badge we three the reason for this 
  is because both my credentials and obv three are intended to be 
  single assertion credentials now the way they go about doing that 
  is quite different.\
Nader Helmy:   Rent and you know I think that the.\
Nader Helmy:  Credentials the way that we've implemented them and 
  my creds are are like actually very simple and and OB B 3 is 
  still a bit more structured and complex but we're hoping that we 
  can sort of draw out the simplest elements from an OB B 3 and 
  have that show up in a json-ld vocab as well as like like we 
  mentioned before bring together you know different groups of 
  people in the community that are already working.\
Nader Helmy:   Working on.\
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> example of mapping PESC to 
  CTDL 
  https://github.com/t3-innovation-network/desm/wiki/5---Viewing-the-mappings\
Nader Helmy:  Channel D vocabs and like let's try to build 
  something simple together and we're hoping and we think that 
  accomplishing the above will will help create what we call sort 
  of an MVP for interoperability right and the education space so 
  this sort of like yeah minimum viable thing that we can all work 
  on to potentially you'll notice with each of these things you're 
  bringing your bringing a different Camp of people to the table 
  right and this one versus.\
Nader Helmy:   Is this the sort of stakeholders you're bringing 
  along.\
Nader Helmy:  This one versus this one but I think all three 
  really critical kind of sets of stakeholders and potentially 
  could be very powerful kind of some greater than its parts sort 
  of situation practically speaking what does this mean I think you 
  know what we want to do essentially is contribute the work that 
  we've done on our json-ld vocab around my credentials to the VC 
  edu so it's already open source so so.\
Nader Helmy:   It just kind of symbolic.\
Nader Helmy:  To the table via this this presentation and kind of 
  follow up with the these links and essentially contribute this 
  work as a starting kind of point or one of the inputs rather for 
  this proposed vocab and essentially gather support as we 
  mentioned for a common json-ld vocab that represents the best of 
  what's out there in the space today and kind of follows the three 
  goals outlined in the previous.\
Nader Helmy:   I'd and then bring this new verifiable.\
Nader Helmy:  And make it an interoperable Target for jmf 
  plugfest 3 because I think that would be a real opportunity to 
  kind of come together and and and like show the work that we've 
  done on this and demonstrate like how useful this idea can be 
  potentially and again this is all motivated by like if you notice 
  like we're not tackling things like the data management in the 
  digital security layer these are.\
Nader Helmy:   Are complex problems for other.\
Nader Helmy:  We think that the thing that would really help 
  education as a space really adopt credentials is trying to solve 
  these problems in a kind of simple fashion so a simple but 
  practical my credential that will be standards-based and a 
  verifiable credentialed this is you know hopefully I single kind 
  of single assertion common Atomic unit of data that can be 
  combined and constructed in different ways but fundamentally is a 
  simple thing that can be.\
Nader Helmy:   Be shared and expressed and understood so.\
Nader Helmy:  What is the.\
Nader Helmy:  The idea behind what we're doing we're very keen to 
  understand how this lens with all of you and you know what kinds 
  of problems you care about in our thinking about if you think 
  these are an appropriate set of trade-offs and if you think this 
  work kind of is liable to continue into the future so yeah.\
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> thanks Nader!\
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah okay so I have a lot of thoughts about this 
  Nader for is a lead really interesting that you guys have done 
  this work and I understand the desire to try and simplify this 
  bag this is why we originally proposed open badges being aligned 
  with BC because we thought that was going to be the first one of 
  the standards that would be the most simplest but but will you 
  may have noticed by working with pass.\
Kerri Lemoie:   Ask and other centers bodies is.\
Kerri Lemoie: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/charter/\
Kerri Lemoie:  Come from the business side of these organizations 
  right and and unfortunately this is something we've had to deal 
  with America the European learning model sort of branched out of 
  that work to right it's like the more you try to the work we've 
  been doing a VC had you said I was going to put the charger in 
  here just so you understand where we are as a group as we've been 
  doing the work that you're describing is trying to do this and 
  honestly what has been has been a way to approach this.\
Kerri Lemoie:   This is to be grateful for the existence of 
  json-ld and thus a vote.\
Kerri Lemoie:  So that all of these models co-exist but yet can 
  be understood like perhaps like with a translation model in 
  between all of them so that's one approach that I would leave in 
  suggesting here so just you know that's what we've been talking 
  about another thing is we're not it's a VCI do isn't a standards 
  body we're just a task force we don't we don't have any standards 
  we just sort of make recommendations as to what the standards 
  bodies can do so.\
Kerri Lemoie:   So I think it is really trust me I think was very 
  interesting to come up with the most.\
Kerri Lemoie:  A to express an achievement I think the world 
  needs that but I think one thing to think about is where you 
  going to do that right I'm going to discuss how is this going to 
  be managed as a standard will be dead at Pasco which you know be 
  great but it will be open work from local communities how will 
  decisions be made what's the governance so there's like there's 
  like those complexities that I know you're thinking of because 
  you're like that start symbol but I just wanted to mention that 
  as you get going with this.\
Nader Helmy:  Yeah yeah absolutely like I think that's probably 
  my number one question coming is group is knowing that it is a 
  task force like and that correct me if I'm wrong I don't think we 
  can like set up in like well I could be wrong but it may be not 
  be like an IP protected workstream around this to to kind of 
  collaborate on the vocab layer we think that because we're not 
  you know.\
Nader Helmy:   Like Reinventing a rehashing.\
Nader Helmy:  The existing standards layer in other words like 
  the core VC stuff and and the proof format like the the security 
  layer and we're just focusing on semantics right like this whole 
  thing is focusing on the semantic layer we're hoping that it's 
  easier to work on then potentially some of this other stuff which 
  so I don't know where the line is exactly in other words in terms 
  of like what we could work potentially like at the vce to you on 
  like set up a kind of work stream.\
Nader Helmy:   Or those interested in.\
Nader Helmy:  Like what would be the boundaries of that thing or 
  is it just that any any work very substance would have to have a 
  different home I don't know these are questions.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah these are those are things that have to be 
  thought through and maybe this is the called the day of we could 
  talk about it in the future if you'd like and then I see Devin 
  feel broker a credential engine queued up and they've been 
  working a lot on properties for credentials from their mission to 
  leave it to them for a little while but thank you for being here 
  today either appreciate it.\
Nader Helmy:  Absolutely yeah I'm very keen to hear from the 
  others.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Thanks and thank you neither 
  this is really useful I just wanted to double what Carrie just 
  said about Thanking us for json-ld because the the linked data 
  lets you connect two additional complexity as much or as little 
  as you need you know I often say that the ctd L is usefully 
  complex with over 900 terms in that link data structure and no 
  one's going to use.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  all of it so if you have a 
  very simple.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Nation of a micro credential 
  you're not likely to have very good transparency because there 
  are so many different interpretations of what micro-credentials 
  represent an increase so to be able to have references to linked 
  data that illuminates as much of that as is useful to meet the 
  use cases is a I think a really elegant solution.\
Nader Helmy:  Thank you yeah no I definitely agree this idea of 
  like the additional complexity is there if you need it or want to 
  use it we think is absolutely the approach I guess I guess the 
  question I have would have for you is sort of like what is the.\
Nader Helmy:  What is the simplest thing that we can all agree on 
  essentially right because even in that world they're sort of 
  almost needs to be like a like some line that we can draw and say 
  below this line we all agree right like we are all using the same 
  thing because if we're building fundamentally on different kind 
  of starting points it's very hard to like like you like you like 
  caring mentioned earlier you need like a translation or like a 
  mapping layer that separate like that is actually very 
  non-trivial.\
Nader Helmy:   To build right like very very difficult so.\
Nader Helmy:  Fleet seems like a big win would be like what and 
  what if the simplest possible thing we can all agree on and maybe 
  it's like something that is for Fields right like something that 
  is exceedingly I don't know what it is but like you know yeah.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Yeah I would say it's actually 
  even simpler than that I mean what we're advocating for is that 
  the digital credential will be cro be has has a CT ID that links 
  to uses linked data to link to see TBL doesn't need to be in our 
  registry it can be cgl that's anywhere and then that link data 
  you know people can follow that link.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  link and learn more about it 
  but also.\
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Stems can follow that link to 
  pull the data that they need and if the data they need isn't 
  there then it's failed to use case but it has provided his added 
  no additional complexity to the digital credential other than 
  adding the link to the link data does it make sense.\
Nader Helmy:  Yeah yeah yeah that does make sense.\
Nader Helmy:  Yeah I think we're very keen to stay very close and 
  connected to past throughout this process and kind of any 
  insights that were end and kind of progress that were able to 
  make with this crowd to kind of bring back to pest I think as 
  well like the as mentioned you know I'm from matter and we were 
  working with digit area on this project and I believe someone to 
  correct me if I'm wrong that there are.\
Nader Helmy:   Digitarium members on that Jason.\
Nader Helmy:  It could be running that but I believe that's the 
  case so there's connection point there in like very much like we 
  want this to be one thing and not to be two separate things 
  right.\
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> badge publisher tool provides 
  a simple way of adding CTDL links to badges, and this strategy is 
  applicable to any digital credentials even though this tool 
  focuses on Open Badges 
  https://credentialengine.org/badge-publisher-tool/\
Nader Helmy:  Awesome thank you for having me and and invited me 
  in to speak and I'm will share this deck kind of after the fact 
  and very keen to I don't know we'll figure out a way to kind of 
  gauge interest in in this right people who want to work on this 
  kind of thing and are interested in it we'll figure it out maybe 
  it's the mailing list maybe it's hopefully not another wedding 
  let's maybe we'll figure out a more elegant way to do that kind 
  of gauge who's interested.\
Nader Helmy:   Added and yeah take it from there but we're very 
  young.\
Nader Helmy:  You know this work and where we've been following 
  closely what's going on in this working group as well and very 
  you know like like interested in and what you guys are doing and 
  the kinds of problems you guys are trying to tackle because we 
  think we're is a lot of certainly a lot of overlap there.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Oh yeah not a question I'll be real quick I made 
  her feel free to leverage this group I know I mentioned earlier 
  that we create a special topic group for the enrollment status 
  credential anyone in this community is welcome to create a 
  special topic group so if you'd like to do that let's talk about 
  that we can help you set that up you can use our mailing list 
  like you can leave MW3 resources to do this if you'd like so 
  let's talk some more about it.\
Nader Helmy:  Yeah that would be awesome.\
Kerri Lemoie:   If we may not be like we're not really a 
  standards group but you could do the work.\
Kerri Lemoie:  And then figure that.\
Kerri Lemoie:  After all right so okay thank you.\
Nader Helmy:  Okay perfect will do.\
