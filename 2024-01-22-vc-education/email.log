Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> Hello everyone, I'm Simone, welcome 
  to today's Verifiable Credentials for Education task force call. 
  Let's start with the usual IP Note: Anyone can participate in 
  these calls. However, all substantive contributors to any CCG 
  Work Items must be members of the CCG with full IPR agreements 
  signed, that you can find on the w3c website, and there is a link 
  to this in the agenda we send out before every meeting. Please 
  note that these meetings are recorded. We have a robot 
  transcriber and we also do an audio and a video recording. If you 
  want to speak, please raise your hand by clicking on the raise 
  hand button on the call's tool bar, or type “q+” in the chat to 
  add yourself to the queue.
Kerri Lemoie:  Sorry to interrupt you some money but I am 
  noticing that there is no transcriber doing things in the truck.
Kerri Lemoie:  There it is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh that happens sometimes.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Well as long as it captures the main.
Karen O'Donoghue:  Hi my name is Karen Passmore I'm working with 
  ASU on my skills wallet I'm a user experience designer and have 
  been working with them for almost a year now on another 
  verifiable credential wallet so Dimitri invited me today because 
  I thought I would get a lot of benefit from listening in so happy 
  to be here.
<dmitri_zagidulin> welcome Karen!! :)
<karen_passmore> Thanks Dmitri!
<kerri_lemoie> Hello All!
<jeff_o_/_humanos> Seems to be an open mic out there 
  somewhere...or is it just me?
Kerri Lemoie: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yKnoBEilvYsMz5jSQNle64EnUSIru-MznE5eNd9ARL4/edit#slide=id.g2b1152cf26f_0_10
<dmitri_zagidulin> @jeff - don't hear one, but could be!
<jeff_o_/_humanos> ykx
Kerri Lemoie:  Awesome thanks to money I'm gonna put a link to 
  our slides here they should be available to all of you if you 
  have any trouble just let me know and I'll check the sharing 
  permissions on it.
Kerri Lemoie:  Me share my screen here I'm going to keep the 
  slides in the mode where you can see the thumbnails so that I can 
  switch tabs when I do the demo.
Kerri Lemoie:  All right let's see here.
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay spending can you see my screen okay.
<phil_(t3)> sharing all good.
Kerri Lemoie:  Excellent to who everybody I'm here with James 
  Chartrand and Dimitri's argue Doolin and we're going to tell you 
  a little bit about the DCCC a little bit about what we've been 
  working on going to do a short demo we also have the folks from 
  learning economy here I believe Jackson is here because they've 
  been working with us on some of the software will do some 
  background and how it all works tell you where we think we're 
  kind of headed and then answer any questions.
Kerri Lemoie:   Is that you might have and we'll try to do this 
  in the time.
Kerri Lemoie:  Have here so let me first tell you about the DCC.
Kerri Lemoie:  You have 13 members I'm around the world and the 
  silver six different countries and with 93 code Repose which we 
  just did an inventory of and checked that count all of these 
  libraries sort of building into the work that are contributing 
  some way to the work that I'm going to show you today just like 
  many of you the D.C.'s vision is to revolutionize how academic 
  achievements are issued manage verified and valued we develop 
  open.
Kerri Lemoie:   In source.
Kerri Lemoie:  Applications that can help anyone Implement 
  trusted and verifiable digital academic credentials and they're 
  they're issuing systems and we believe also like many of you that 
  Open Standards like the w3c verifiable credentials and open 
  source software lead to the most effective solutions that can 
  most easily cost you place be opted right through Global 
  interoperability so this is what we work on together as a with 
  our members and also our team that supports our members.
Kerri Lemoie:   Is some of the.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> Credential Engine greatly 
  appreciates the DCC engagement and expertise in CTDL advisory 
  groups!
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> 
  Simone_Ravaioli_(Co-Chair) , Kerri_Lemoie -- transcriber needs a 
  kick
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> @Ted - not sure why it is not 
  working for some participants...
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> definetly something we will look 
  into it
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> we will have the audio recording 
  anyways...
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> Simone 
  Ravaioli (Co-Chair) -- it cut out mid-sentence from Kerri. I 
  think this is not the partial-deafness (which is usually 
  browser-related).
<dmitri_zagidulin> oooh, yeah, that's not good
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Kerri or @Simone - might make sense to hit 
  Record again
<kerri_lemoie> I think if we hit record again, it deletes the 
  previous recording.
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> Recording is ON. If I turn it off 
  and on, we might loose the audio until now.
<dmitri_zagidulin> good point!
<dmitri_zagidulin> as long as the audio's still on
<leah_houston_(hpec)> huh?
<leah_houston_(hpec)> I missed what he just said re contact info
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> ugh... 
  sorry. I thought restarting recording appended new to old.
<leah_houston_(hpec)> Jackson - if you could please share the 
  contact info/website you mentioned- i did not get it when you 
  spoke
<sudesh_sangelkar> Jackson - This is Sudesh from Phoenix Arizona. 
  Does entire credential cycle ready for apps to integrate starting 
  from issuance to verification? Which standards are supported at 
  this point?
<taylor_-_lef> Here you go Leah:https://www.learningeconomy.io
<leah_houston_(hpec)> Kerri - Which Student informtion systems 
  are you integrated with and what is the opt in/opt out process?
<jacksón> Thanks Taylor for sharing the links! @Sudesh - yes, we 
  support integration from issuance to verification. We support 
  DIDs (web, key, and more), VC-API, OIDC4VCI, CHAPI, Ed25516, 
  Secp256k1 - we have participated in community Plugfest 1, 2, and 
  3 as well! Happy to have a chat if you have more questions!
<jacksón> jackson@learningeconomy.io
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Leah - so, it's just a CSV, so the 
  issuer/registrar uploads a spreadsheet of students
<leah_houston_(hpec)> where is the agency for the *TRUE* owner of 
  the credentials (the student/learner?)
<dmitri_zagidulin> @leah - that begins when the student picks up 
  the credential
<dmitri_zagidulin> agency passes to them
<leah_houston_(hpec)> yes I understand that - but only if the 
  school opts in/sends it to them - it is not automatically 
  available- correct?
<dmitri_zagidulin> correct. same as with a paper credential
<sudesh_sangelkar> This Is Sudesh & Ramakant from SOLO …  
<sudesh_sangelkar> Thanks Jackson!
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> @Leah - you might want to ask to 
  Jacskon about integration with SIS... I think the LearnCloud has 
  a strong integration feature
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> Simone 
  Ravaioli (Co-Chair), Dmitri Zagidulin -- If I knew the repo, I'd 
  log an issue to make the recording file title include datetime 
  (perhaps rounded to the minute) instead of just date. This would 
  make moving them around a bit more complicated, but given the 
  frequency of the recording failing mid-meeting, this seems 
  important. Especially if the recording includes voices that the 
  transcriber doesn't hear.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @tallted - lemme see if I can find the repo, 
  it's somewhere on CCG
<nate_otto_(he/him)> Is the verifier plus link generation 
  something that can be done with any credential in this wallet, or 
  is it specific to credentials issued via this coordinator?
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Nate - any credential
<kerri_lemoie> @nate - any credential in the wallet
<kerri_lemoie> The links expire in one year and can be destroyed 
  and recreated at any time by the earner.
<jacksón> @Leah yes LearnCloud connects directly with LMS/SIS/HR 
  for seamless integration into existing systems!
<dmitri_zagidulin> @TallTed - I think the generating code is the 
  .sh files in https://github.com/w3c-ccg/meetings
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> looks like it would be fairly 
  straightforward to use the badge alignment field in the template 
  to include a link to CTDL Registry data for further context-- 
  which could then be a link in the credential display in the 
  wallet-- does that make sense?
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> @Kerrie, can you please share the share link 
  to the demo cred, so we can explore the details?
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Deb - definitely! I think the ASU Corner 
  Pocket team is looking to explore that integration, and DCC team 
  is very interested as well!
<kerri_lemoie> I forgot to go into revoking or credential status 
  checking.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> :+1:
<karen_passmore> Why do links expire??
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Karen - just for data retention policy 
  reasons
<karen_passmore> (ignore that dbl question mark ;)
<dmitri_zagidulin> the issuer could set them to not expire
<karen_passmore> ok perfect, thanks
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Deb - we'd love to do a VC Edu call, showing 
  the CTDL integration for the wallet, once that launches!
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> that would be great!
<kerri_lemoie> DCC Docker Hub: 
  https://hub.docker.com/orgs/digitalcredentials/repositories
<nate_otto_(he/him)> revoking: 95% for stuff that was issued by 
  mistake
<ramakant> This is Ram  & Sudesh from SOLO.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Nate - lol great point
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Can we also take a look at the revocation 
  list on Github, if it's public?
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Ildiko - of course, one sec
<sudesh_sangelkar> thanks!! Kerrie
<ramakant> Thanks!
<kayode_ezike> Actually, LCW does support VPR for the exchange of 
  credentials
<dmitri_zagidulin> but not the selective disclosure
<kayode_ezike> Correct
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> So it's not like a CSV with binary values 
  for revocation status.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Ildiko right, it's a bit more compressed than 
  that
https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/ in this format
<dmitri_zagidulin> here's an example status VC: 
  https://digitalcredentials.github.io/credential-status-playground/JWZM3H8WKU#3
<dmitri_zagidulin> and yeah, Otto's link is a good example of 
  what the VC looks like
Kerri Lemoie: 
  https://github.com/digitalcredentials/credential-status-manager-git
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Thank you both @Nate and @Dmitri, very much 
  appreciated.
<sudesh_sangelkar> How to get details for APP integrations ?
<sudesh_sangelkar> whats the process for APP integrations ?
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Ildiko - here's some example credentials with 
  status code, towards the bottom of 
  https://github.com/digitalcredentials/docs/issues/10
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> Dmitri, 
  Simone -- FYI, https://github.com/w3c-ccg/meetings/issues/92
<simone_ravaioli_(co-chair)> Thank you Ted !
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> This is perfect! Thanks, @Dmitri
<nate_otto_(he/him)> @Jacksón I have a question for offline about 
  LearnCard Wallet, how to troubleshoot a ~"not verified" error 
  message on a credential, could you let me know where to reach you 
  or email me: nate@skybridgeskills.com
<sudesh_sangelkar> Is it possible to get on the call for a quick 
  meet ? i am in MST zone
<kerri_lemoie> Plugfest links here: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/
<jacksón> @Nate yes! Please shoot me an email at: 
  jackson@learningeconomy.io
<jacksón> Happy to help troubleshoot 😃
<sudesh_sangelkar> Thanks dmitri
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> thank you for all this 
  valuable work!
<sharon_leu> Thanks, DCC team!
<jacksón> (my guess is it is because of static vs dynamic 
  contexts @Nate!)
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks James & Dmitri!
<jacksón> Thanks DCC team! 🙌🎉
<sudesh_sangelkar> THANK YOU ALL
<taylor_-_lef> Thanks all 🙏
