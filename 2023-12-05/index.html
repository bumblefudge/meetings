<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  I&apos;m not saying here that once the technology is unblocked and once individuals control their credentials that all of the systemic and economic barriers that people face are suddenly going to disappear but what we are saying is we recognize that this is a barrier and we would like to address it so what does that look like that looks like a person with some formal and informal learning some perhaps community service military service. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Thanks identify the fication some work experience and credentials but currently these certifications and licenses and documents live in different silent systems that are actually controlled spy entities that are not the individual not the credential holder so we envision a future where individuals hold their credentials could be in a wallet or some other way and they can create different combination use them in combinations. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Anil John has done with the Silicon Valley Innovation program which I know a number of people on this call have previously participated in and we essentially said if we are going to take a look at this image what we need to do is break it down into the different steps where verifiable credentials as a foundation can enable this kind of interoperability and portability that we want to see so we have over the since June of twenty twenty-two hosted three. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  In straight I&apos;m a progression from left hand side to right hand side of this graphic and I will quickly go through the three plugfest including the one that we just hosted at the iiw this past October and I will say a couple of things about what we learned and what we think that means for the future and I will also say that the links to all of the information the technical specifications the participants the demo day videos. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  And also follow along that way so in this first plugfest we wanted we invited wallet implementers to demonstrate the credential wallet interoperability layer so essentially this was our hello world that we are trying this out we use the open badge version 3 with which was still only in candidate final at the time we did the plugfest and each of the wallet implementers was required to receive a display one bear. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Which was the jmf credential that we completely made up it had a cute image and essentially we listed a few of the sort of data fields that we required to be displayed and the observation that I would say the takeaway from plug best one is that in the u.s. at least education credential standards are still emerging and not broadly implemented so as I mentioned before we used the open badge versions. <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-53').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-53').show()" id="53" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Candidate final a number of changes occurred during the course of the plug best and as a result of the plugfest so both as a result of like I think 20 to 30 different wallet implementers giving feedback to this path to the spec but also because of errors that we found in suggestions for improvement so that is like I will sort of pin that and then get back to it later and then I will say we sort of in. <a id="link-53" style="display:none;" href="#53">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-55').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-55').show()" id="55" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  The second plugfest and we said that in order again to imagine a scenario where a person controls more than one credential the wallet then needs to receive more than one verifiable credential from more than one issuer but at the same time we invited issuers to issue their credential into more than one wallet sort of demonstrating that their wallet has viability outside of their own existing platform ecosystem I have three General sort of observation. <a id="link-55" style="display:none;" href="#55">✪</a></div>
