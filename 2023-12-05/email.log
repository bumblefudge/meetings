Harrison_Tang: So welcome to this week's at w3c ccg meeting today 
  we're very excited to have Sharon from jobs for for the future to 
  come back here A year later to provide an update in regards to 
  jmf but before then just want to quickly go through some of the 
  administrative stop so first of all just a quick reminder in 
  regards to the code of ethics and professional contact reminder.
Harrison_Tang:  I just want to make sure that we.
Harrison_Tang: You have respectful conversations acknowledge each 
  other's perspectives a second a quick note in regards to 
  intellectual property so anybody can participate in these calls 
  however all substantive contributions to an ECG work items must 
  be member of the ccg with a full IP our agreement signed so if 
  you have issues in regards to creating the w3c account or have 
  questions in regards to the Community College.
Harrison_Tang: Yes agreement please feel free to reach out to any 
  of the cultures here.
Harrison_Tang: So these meetings are being automatically recorded 
  and minutes are automatically transcribed and we will publish the 
  meeting minutes and all the recording usually the following day 
  where we think the next few days we used to teach at at uq 
  speakers during the cause of as well as to take minutes you can 
  type in Q + to add yourself to the queue or q- to remove and you 
  can type in queue.
Harrison_Tang:  question mark to see who is the cute.
Harrison_Tang: All right quick moment for the introductions and 
  reintroduction so if you're new to the community or you haven't 
  been active and want to re-engage with the community please feel 
  free to just unmute and speak up.
Harrison_Tang: Right so we do this like every week so feel free 
  to now you feel feeling a little bit shy feel free to just do 
  that next week as well all right announcements and reminders any 
  new announcements or reminders of the events upcoming events or 
  agendas.
Harrison_Tang: Right a quick saying so we recently I think about 
  two weeks ago we opened up the the process of nominating and 
  electing like a new culture and we mentioned that not just do the 
  in the meeting but also can really send out an email about that 
  so far we have one nomination will and I think today is the.
Harrison_Tang: After the nomination so Kimberly you might 
  actually yeah.
Kimberly Linson:  It was I was just going to say thank you 
  Harrison for getting started yeah I had a little little snafu 
  right there at the top of the hour so it was late joining so 
  thank you yes the the nomination period closed last night at 
  midnight Pacific time and so with only one nominee well we are 
  pleased to have him as a another co-co-chair and then I'm really 
  excited about that.
Kimberly Linson:  And very last minute if he had just a moment to 
  introduce himself so I will go and head and put him on the spot 
  and let him sort of say a few words before we move on to our main 
  topic.
Kimberly Linson:  We're really excited about it too I had an 
  opportunity to spend some time with Will and appreciate how he 
  asks questions and is very articulate in helping and helping 
  everyone understand what it is that's being talked about so we 
  are really glad to have you and welcome.
Kimberly Linson:  Okay so Harrison where are we were doing 
  announcements does anyone else have an announcement or reminder.
Harrison_Tang: Give a quick shout-out to will again for actually 
  volunteer volunteering for this work so you know very excited 
  about them on and you know I think she she G will be even better 
  with with his help.
Harrison_Tang: All right I do have a quick announcement so there 
  has been like a threat in regards to the video recordings so a 
  quick thing let me share my screen.
Harrison_Tang: Sorry I don't have this handy with me.
Harrison_Tang: Every week we actually do send out the meeting 
  minutes so there is there's a script that sends out let me share 
  this right now so every week actually someone is helping helping 
  us in the background to run the script in sent out this email and 
  there's a script that.
Harrison_Tang:  actually old.
Harrison_Tang: Regenerate this email and then what it does is it 
  includes things like although transcriptions and by late 
  sometimes there are errors in the auto transcription so we'll get 
  these requests and we'll try to go back in and then try to add 
  that them to correct the transcription errors and then there's 
  also a link to the audio recording and actually there's also a 
  link to the video version as well.
Harrison_Tang:  and they all follow the same format so.
Harrison_Tang: You know you can see the link here and then it 
  just follows the year month and date format so just want to take 
  this opportunity to solicit a volunteer a developer volunteer to 
  help us modify the script so that we can actually automatically 
  include the video link in this email as well but before we get 
  that volunteer to help us do this.
Harrison_Tang:  we'll just send out.
Harrison_Tang: Manually in the agenda emails I send out pretty 
  much every week so I will add it in the pended at the end of the 
  email to the links in regards to the previous meetings so I'll 
  include those things the previous meeting links to transcription 
  audio recording and the videos in the emails I send out the 
  following week okay.
Harrison_Tang:  all right.
Harrison_Tang: I will reply back to the thread and then you know 
  if you know anybody or if you can actually take about an hour or 
  two to help us modify the script just emailed back to any of the 
  cultures appreciate the help thanks all right any other 
  announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Any updates on the work items.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Wait one second one second Harrison I think 
  Erica has has a hand up.
Harrison_Tang: All right so I just want to get to the man jenda 
  so I think a couple months ago or a year ago we invited Sharon to 
  actually farm jobs for the future jff to actually help sorry.
Erica Connell:  Hi yeah I didn't sorry that was I try to be the 
  Applause and it did hand up but I took myself off the queue so 
  you shouldn't thank you drinking.
Harrison_Tang: No no worries I did that before too thanks thanks 
  a lot alright so today we're very excited to have Sharon back to 
  actually provide AA place in regards to our chops for the future 
  so Sharon the for short.
Sharon Leu: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PWl8AlLOzn0O7dvSiAXNV_JfGx9qdMb4JRherUZGu0o/edit?usp=sharing
<econnell> (thx, Dmitri!)
Sharon Leu:  Okay I hope you can hear me I'm going to try to 
  share my screen but I'm also dropping a link into the chat which 
  is the deck that I'm going to be using today let's see I have too 
  many windows open so here we go are you looking at my slide deck.
Sharon Leu:  Okay I will say assume yes okay so thank you for 
  welcoming me back I'm a little nervous but hopefully this will be 
  a good conversation rather than just pure talking on my part so 
  feel free to say something either in the chat or raise your hand 
  I'm sure one of the moderators will interrupt me and let me know 
  and again I don't mind that so I think that will be really fun so 
  I will just do a quick introduction.
Sharon Leu:  Whatever the case may be my name is Sharon Lou and I 
  work at an organization called jobs for the future or jmf and 
  essentially jmf is a not-for-profit organization in the United 
  States we work on transformation of the education and Workforce 
  ecosystems and our goal for this year which is our 40th birthday 
  is that we will help 75 million people who face systemic barriers 
  to advancement work in quality jobs Jay.
Sharon Leu:  I'm physically I guess organizationally located is 
  the Innovation arm I guess without disparaging I guess my other 
  colleagues and what we focus on is whether technology or the 
  application of different Technologies can help us to advance 
  these goals our main funder is Walmart and they have provided a 
  generous amount of support for all of this work that I'm going to 
  be talking.
Sharon Leu:   Young about.
Sharon Leu:  Well as work that goes into the future and I'll talk 
  a little bit about what that looks like towards the end and what 
  is exciting about this funding is that it has enabled us to work 
  together with a wide variety of Partners I've listed some of them 
  on the slide principally the national Governors Association so 
  that some of the work that we do can have sustainability in 
  policy practice and funding.
Sharon Leu:   Across the.
Sharon Leu:  With digital credentials Consortium in the VC edu 
  task force for which there is a big overlap between the cultures 
  of the VC edgy task force as well as DC and a number of other 
  partners who may or may not have sort of Technology expertise but 
  are grounded in the use cases that we are interested in so what 
  is our use case then this next slide shows a little bit about how 
  we think.
Sharon Leu:  Typically verifiable credentials can unblock some of 
  the barriers that people face to advancement and in particular 
  it's this idea of do I control credentials aka the assertions or 
  evidence of my skills and abilities in a way that allows me to 
  pursue whatever opportunities I choose to pursue next obviously 
  this.
Sharon Leu:   Is not.
Sharon Leu:  I'm not saying here that once the technology is 
  unblocked and once individuals control their credentials that all 
  of the systemic and economic barriers that people face are 
  suddenly going to disappear but what we are saying is we 
  recognize that this is a barrier and we would like to address it 
  so what does that look like that looks like a person with some 
  formal and informal learning some perhaps community service 
  military service.
Sharon Leu:  Thanks identify the fication some work experience 
  and credentials but currently these certifications and licenses 
  and documents live in different silent systems that are actually 
  controlled spy entities that are not the individual not the 
  credential holder so we envision a future where individuals hold 
  their credentials could be in a wallet or some other way and they 
  can create different combination use them in combinations.
Sharon Leu:  Are applying to college to get prior learning 
  credits or if they're applying for a job to show the appropriate 
  certifications and eligibility to work and that's actually why we 
  are interested in the verifiable credentials ecosystem because 
  this is in our minds how this use case that we are interested in 
  becomes a reality so how did we do this we did this by copying.
Sharon Leu:   Being some of the.
Sharon Leu:  Anil John has done with the Silicon Valley 
  Innovation program which I know a number of people on this call 
  have previously participated in and we essentially said if we are 
  going to take a look at this image what we need to do is break it 
  down into the different steps where verifiable credentials as a 
  foundation can enable this kind of interoperability and 
  portability that we want to see so we have over the since June of 
  twenty twenty-two hosted three.
Sharon Leu:  In straight I'm a progression from left hand side to 
  right hand side of this graphic and I will quickly go through the 
  three plugfest including the one that we just hosted at the iiw 
  this past October and I will say a couple of things about what we 
  learned and what we think that means for the future and I will 
  also say that the links to all of the information the technical 
  specifications the participants the demo day videos.
Sharon Leu:   Are all available on the VC edgy page.
Sharon Leu:  And also follow along that way so in this first 
  plugfest we wanted we invited wallet implementers to demonstrate 
  the credential wallet interoperability layer so essentially this 
  was our hello world that we are trying this out we use the open 
  badge version 3 with which was still only in candidate final at 
  the time we did the plugfest and each of the wallet implementers 
  was required to receive a display one bear.
Sharon Leu:   Bible credential.
Sharon Leu:  Which was the jmf credential that we completely made 
  up it had a cute image and essentially we listed a few of the 
  sort of data fields that we required to be displayed and the 
  observation that I would say the takeaway from plug best one is 
  that in the u.s. at least education credential standards are 
  still emerging and not broadly implemented so as I mentioned 
  before we used the open badge versions.
Sharon Leu:  Candidate final a number of changes occurred during 
  the course of the plug best and as a result of the plugfest so 
  both as a result of like I think 20 to 30 different wallet 
  implementers giving feedback to this path to the spec but also 
  because of errors that we found in suggestions for improvement so 
  that is like I will sort of pin that and then get back to it 
  later and then I will say we sort of in.
Sharon Leu:   Kris the technical.
Sharon Leu:  The second plugfest and we said that in order again 
  to imagine a scenario where a person controls more than one 
  credential the wallet then needs to receive more than one 
  verifiable credential from more than one issuer but at the same 
  time we invited issuers to issue their credential into more than 
  one wallet sort of demonstrating that their wallet has viability 
  outside of their own existing platform ecosystem I have three 
  General sort of observation.
Sharon Leu:  And I think.
Sharon Leu:  Again I will pin and we can have a discussion around 
  but that there was a great I will call this the great protocol 
  divide to be funny but there were definitely protocol camps we 
  did not we took the position that you could select your own 
  protocol in that the plug best technical team would support any 
  of the protocols that people selected and generally the two bigs 
  teams were the VC API chappie team and then the teens using the 
  Open Eyes.
Sharon Leu:   D stack we did have in the second plugfest.
Sharon Leu:  Of people working with the did come the tooth 
  protocol we also noted that there was a correlation between the 
  protocol divided and some internationalisation so it raised a few 
  questions about International compatibility and and the third 
  sort of observation that I definitely will pin is that some of 
  the I think there is a correlation also with protocol selection 
  internationalisation and the size and scale of.
Sharon Leu:   Implementers in different places.
Sharon Leu:  So finally we the plug best that we just did we took 
  a look at the next step after a person compiles a bunch of 
  credentials which is the verifiable presentation creation and so 
  the wallets were so we went back to focusing on the wallets.
Sharon Leu:  We told the wallet that they needed to request three 
  credentials from over there sorry to receive a request for three 
  credentials from the verifier and then the wallet holder needs to 
  be able to respond to the request by selecting which credentials 
  to share and then creating a presentation to send back to the 
  requester for verification and essentially this was I think this 
  is like the ugliest lied but I'm going to use it anyway because I 
  don't.
Sharon Leu:   Have a better one.
Sharon Leu:  But like we thought that this workflow simulated are 
  real world use case which is an institution a training provider 
  when a player says to a person I would like to give you a 
  credential a person agrees to accept it and then on the other end 
  of that in a potential employer or an institution where someone 
  is applying requesting to see the credential and then a person 
  again giving permission to see it so we think that with the three 
  plugfest together.
Sharon Leu:   We were able to.
Sharon Leu:  This transaction we used again fake jmf credential 
  which is a little green one we also made a requirement that you 
  had to use the u.s. permanent resident card which I get I think a 
  number of people had experience using because of the S VIP plug 
  vest and then we had a miscellaneous number of credentials that 
  we put into the VC playground that people could receive.
Sharon Leu:  That I will okay so what so what happens in the end 
  so sorry here's the website you can take a quick look at the 
  requirements there's a link to the participant list with the 
  videos that people submitted an overview of what what happens 
  okay so here is a list of who came to demo day I just thought 
  this was a fun graphic of where people were but essentially 20.
Sharon Leu:   Two wallets.
Sharon Leu:  The successfully and I listed them Below in addition 
  people create there were six open-source verifiers that were 
  created by Daniel Cox digital desired Zoella Greek universities 
  matter and all tidy and then also one non open-source verifier 
  that was created that this was really interesting because we had 
  initially not thought to focus on the verifier but then there was 
  so much interested in that we just thought oh this is kind of a 
  fun bonus and then we had bonus points for.
Sharon Leu:   One sort of pairing between matter and Greek 
  universities Network that.
Sharon Leu:  Portability that was beyond just the request that we 
  put them okay so I'm not going to play these videos but I have 
  linked to videos that I think are interesting Randa not just 
  because Kimberly is on this call with because it gives a great 
  overview of how the technical requirements looked and what we 
  were specifically requesting that wallet providers sort of 
  demonstrate I.
Sharon Leu:   I am also.
Sharon Leu:  Swing this wallet by a company called Gobekli the 
  universal Talent pipeline the password because they implemented a 
  couple of features that were not required and that I think are 
  interesting as far as like how does a person select credentials 
  to be part of this presentation and then I will also I'm going to 
  share this screenshot of our slack Channel and this was actually 
  one of the things that I appreciate the most about the plugfest 
  which.
Sharon Leu:   Is that during the period of.
Sharon Leu:  It was truly collaborative I'm not trying to put 
  anyone on the spot I just screenshotted this randomly on off in 
  October for another demo but people were really working together 
  really well and appreciated how collaborative everyone approach 
  this with so before I get to what's next I'm just wondering 
  should I stop for questions or should I just plow through.
Harrison_Tang: Anyone have any questions.
Rachel_Donahue_(she/they)_-_Digital_Promise: Hi yeah I do have a 
  question I am you know still relatively new to the credential 
  exchange protocols and I often will hear chappie and be Capi used 
  as if they're like I guess the language around explaining like 
  the different protocols I often hear them kind of used almost 
  synonymously but then another other times I hear them.
Rachel_Donahue_(she/they)_-_Digital_Promise: Effort protocols so 
  I was just hoping to have I guess some verbose clarification on 
  that.
Sharon Leu:  Does someone want to take that question is a little 
  bit not related to the plugfest in so I'm afraid that I don't I 
  don't want to get that wrong.
Harrison_Tang: Dimitri you have it outside Demetria volunteer 
  you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sure yeah yeah no problem and then also I 
  think somebody else might be on the Queue before me but real 
  quick chappie is a wallet selector and if able to pass on any 
  sort of protocol through pipes and then DC API is one of the 
  examples of the protocols with which the wallet selector works 
  but chappie the wallet selector can also be used with open ID 
  and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Is Dead Calm so at the shore bird.
Rachel_Donahue_(she/they)_-_Digital_Promise: And sorry that this 
  wasn't totally related thanks.
Harrison_Tang: Any other questions.
Harrison_Tang: Right sure please proceed.
Sharon Leu:  Okay so what's next this is a really great question 
  something that we did take a little bit of a break after the 
  third plugfest from thinking about but as we start planning for 
  2024 we want to be thinking about this I actually just included 
  really this picture that I took of w and we had initial 
  conversations about like what are some of the technical questions 
  that we could be asking as we sort of think to how do we build on 
  this.
Sharon Leu:   There are obviously some issues like we could talk 
  about like Chris.
Sharon Leu:  The wave set like you know building out and 
  different vocabularies and schemas or building up Registries 
  there just aren't any number of miscellaneous sort of technical 
  tasks that this would be a good opportunity to to get done you 
  know through the resources that we have to support plugfest 
  another approach is again I am not going to play the video 
  because I have no idea what's going to happen but if you want to 
  watch the video later this is the demo that the Greek University.
Sharon Leu:   Network and matter.
Sharon Leu:  Did where they showed the credential moving from a 
  university in Greece to the system of record in a university in 
  Canada so you know one possible approach is can we develop an 
  actual end-to-end use case and use live credentials to then 
  demonstrate that this sort of ecosystem has like has viability 
  outside the sandbox so these are these are sort of two.
Sharon Leu:   Two different approaches that.
Sharon Leu:  Like we have in mind I'm actually really curious 
  about what you think as a group here and how that aligns with 
  some current and or upcoming ccg work items we want to align with 
  the momentum that's already in the community instead of sort of 
  creating our own thing so as we think about it though there are 
  three questions that are really just the top of my mind and then 
  I will also allow other people including like do.
Sharon Leu:   Petrie who.
Sharon Leu:  You know really critical in the success of this and 
  some of the others that did participate to weigh in but as we 
  think about like the future plugfest so I think about the three 
  things that I said that I observed right the first is like which 
  protocols and obviously you know jff we're not a technology 
  vendor we are not standards you know we're not like even really 
  reps in the field so we don't want to have a point of view on 
  whether you should be using the C API chat.
Sharon Leu:   Be or open ID but what we are noticing is.
Sharon Leu:  Good the sort of divide and who selects which 
  protocols is actually there are some interesting observations so 
  the first thing that we observe is that for a lot of vendors that 
  are in the u.s. chappie be Capi tended to be the protocol that 
  they selected whereas some of ours are European wallet providers 
  chose open to use open ID connect and I think that a lot of that 
  has to do with.
Sharon Leu:   You know the European Union and their.
<frank_cicio> Frank iQ4 happy to share the addition of pathways 
  and jobs ..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzQS_R4kwfY
Sharon Leu:  No equivalent position that the u.s. government has 
  and in fact there's not sort of an American digital credential 
  standard the same way there is a Europe past learning model 
  standard for how credentials have described so that's one 
  interesting sort of implementation Tatian question because it is 
  interesting to think about like.
Sharon Leu:   Like how that will play out.
<frank_cicio> Plugfest is a great initiative
Sharon Leu:  And I think it also has like like an observation 
  that I had was also that that may be related to how some of the 
  larger more influential tech companies like halfway to have 
  fallen on the like which protocol to select scale and I think 
  that they're typically is an argument that is made which is you 
  know if you do it the way that a very large tech company does it 
  then you will achieve scale or.
Sharon Leu:   L ability more quickly.
Sharon Leu:  I think though that in the US market that may not be 
  the case because especially in US education you know academic 
  freedom faculty academic freedom is like kind of the most sort of 
  important value and there is not a principle of a wintry school 
  or the chancellor of a college that could tell every Professor 
  every teacher how to run their individual classroom.
Sharon Leu:   Much less imposed.
Sharon Leu:  Nor is it legally allowable for the US Department of 
  Education to implement models like in the same way that the 
  European Union has so I think that you know I have a little 
  skepticism about whether a lining with large tech companies 
  allows you to achieve scale and scalability and so anyway those 
  are just the questions that I have about like how does this play 
  out in protocols while at the same time wanting to understand 
  since we have.
Sharon Leu:   You know some potential interest in like in.
Sharon Leu:  Italy whether that makes us institutions and u.s. 
  wallets sort of compatible with that kind of demonstration the 
  next question that I think about is like what is the 
  interoperability that we still need to demonstrate like like are 
  we satisfied as a group that we did actually demonstrate the kind 
  of interoperability that using verifiable credentials and dids 
  allow and if not like what is still missing from that picture 
  because I think fun.
Sharon Leu:   I mentally like use case is one thing but the other 
  like the counterpart.
Sharon Leu:  Did the technology did the infrastructure we're 
  proposing do the thing that we said it should do and so then it 
  gets us to the size matter for scale which is related to what I 
  just said about like whether big companies adopt certain 
  standards but also like how then do we like promote wide step 
  spread use of verifiable credentials whether it's in the 
  education transfer use case whether it's in the employment 
  employment use case is it by.
Sharon Leu:   Promoting like large-scale.
Sharon Leu:  Issuance of the verifiable credentials is it working 
  with verifiers to actually demonstrate that they can receive and 
  verify the credentials is working with holders so that they're 
  more wallets and more people demanding the credentials so I don't 
  I think that there's no wrong answer really but it's more an 
  issue of like where can we get impact what kind of impact and 
  what would everyone be interested in working on so I'm going to.
Sharon Leu:   Up there.
Sharon Leu:  And open it up for other people to talk and feel 
  free to ping me after I left my email address here and I'll stop 
  sharing.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Sharon Wright David you're on the queue.
Sharon Leu:  Oh thank you David I think I definitely am and I 
  know also that Anil is interested so for there's some version of 
  this going on with his plugfest so let's definitely connect I 
  would love to know more about what that group is working on and 
  let's see if there are some like areas of I think synergy.
Harrison_Tang: Any other questions Benjamin.
Benjamin Young:  Yes someone who participated at the plug test I 
  just wanted to publicly thank Sharon and the rest of the team for 
  all they've done it was a really great experience and if you 
  weren't aware of it and hope to participate in the future and 
  definitely stay in touch with him.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Benjamin.
Harrison_Tang: Any other questions or comments.
Kimberly Linson:  So I don't know if this is a question or a 
  comment or just maybe a provocative statement hoping that someone 
  will kind of.
Kimberly Linson:  In but I think you know a lot of us have been 
  involved in the progress and Benjamin I want to Echo what you 
  said Sharon for for us these have been the technical deadlines 
  that that propelled us forward and really like made us you know 
  make sure that we were doing the thing that we thought we were 
  doing and I'm so grateful and appreciative for that one of the 
  things that we've been I think those of us.
Kimberly Linson:   Us that are in this community.
Kimberly Linson:  Have been very much a part of conversations 
  around skills and skills based hiring and the importance of 
  helping those 75 million people represent their skills and I 
  think that I have been thinking about verifiable credentials and 
  open Badges and comprehensive learner records as being the thing 
  that tells the skill but I think maybe.
Kimberly Linson:  Be those aren't as as closely tied as I think 
  that they are and.
Kimberly Linson:  I'm wondering what people are thinking about in 
  terms of how wallets display skills as opposed to achievements 
  and assertions and and and I think all of a sudden I'm sort of 
  like I've had this sort of light bulb moment that skills are even 
  more of a granular step down from an open badge or from any kind 
  of a credential and how are we how are we thinking about.
Kimberly Linson:  And I was sort of just a like a rant but if 
  anyone else wants to jump in and kind of add with their thinking 
  I'd love to hear it.
Rachel_Donahue_(she/they)_-_Digital_Promise: And right yeah I was 
  looking into some of the other wallets that were out there and I 
  saw this one company is using Rich skill descriptors it's 
  something again that I'm kind of new to so I'm not exactly sure 
  how they are attached to a credential or if it's like a separate 
  type of recognition object but I think that I don't know if 
  anyone else here knows a lot of.
Rachel_Donahue_(she/they)_-_Digital_Promise:  about that but I.
Rachel_Donahue_(she/they)_-_Digital_Promise: Learn more about 
  that as well and I think that that might be a good Avenue of 
  connection between sharing those more granular skills outside of 
  a specific credential or achievement.
https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/rsd
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: I really appreciate this 
  conversation and sharing for walking through that all the plug 
  test details but I want to kind of go further I'll let somebody 
  else talk about rich scale descriptors and ours dies because 
  those I think are definitely have a place in this especially as 
  we think about like an open-source freely available staff to 
  build on but given point around skills and the way that the those 
  are coded in the way that those are presented we've been doing a 
  lot.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  ah to work with employers and HR 
  Tech providers.
https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/osmt
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Of the their view on digital 
  credentials learning and employment records clrs like all these 
  pieces and one thing that continues to come up is the view or the 
  perspective of an individual's learning record whatever that 
  looks like from the different stakeholder perspective so if I 
  have a wallet and I'm viewing my achievements my skills would 
  have you inside that wallet and prepare that or connect that to 
  an HR.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  our platform.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Export something as a resume to 
  share with you know application tracking system or a potential 
  employer what does that view like on their side how do they 
  ingest that a content and then how are they how is it appearing 
  and their dashboards so that's something that we you know as we 
  think about some of the different stakeholders in the views of 
  these skills or wondering how can we package it or help unpack 
  the packaged in a way that makes most sense.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  sense for the stakeholders that 
  are viewing.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: That makes sense.
Harrison_Tang: Questions in regards to Collins coming.
Harrison_Tang: Hi Sharon you're next in the queue.
Sharon Leu:  Great that's a great comment and a great question 
  and I think that this is also the question that we have about 
  what interoperability demonstrate the way that I have always 
  needed is that you know there are standards for the credential 
  and then within the credential which is the credential design 
  aspects of this there are they're sort of another level of 
  interoperability that needs to happen with the.
Sharon Leu:   The skills data so at JFK.
Sharon Leu:  You encourage people that we work with so we support 
  a number of projects that involves you know developing training 
  programs or developing you know you know Workforce Pathways and 
  we always ask people like we tried to ask people this you can't 
  obviously make anyone do anything they don't want to do but to do 
  the hard work of using linked open data to describe the skills 
  that are within the credentials and provide sufficient detailed 
  information about like what did a.
Sharon Leu:   Person have to do to earn the credential in 
  addition to some of.
Sharon Leu:  Engine Providence data and that and I think what 
  where that gets us is like what intelligence can you then 
  generate based on the data that's within the credential right so 
  you have almost two problems that you've identified Kimberly one 
  is the credential portability so can the credential move from 
  place to place and then the second question which is once it's 
  moved to a secondary location for verification what is the person 
  looking at and what do they hope to know.
Sharon Leu:   No from that credential and then sort of a sub.
Sharon Leu:  Be the issue of you know which is all of the rage 
  these days what does a wallet what can a wallet tell you about 
  the things that are in the wallet and this is where I think we're 
  in a little bit of a dangerous place so like I said it's all the 
  rage AI career path finding that's like the number one kind of 
  investment in Workforce Tech that's happening these days you know 
  I think the phrase Google Maps for your.
Sharon Leu:   Career comes up in almost every.
Sharon Leu:  Here and the idea is you have a bunch of skills 
  you've shared them to some system that will tell you based on the 
  skills that you have here are some possible job opportunities or 
  training opportunities or you know based on what you're 
  interested in pursuing here are some things that you can do to 
  fill your skills Gap the reason I think this is dangerous is 
  twofold number one I think that we don't know like how those AI 
  Bots were trained and whether those recommendations are good or 
  bad.
Sharon Leu:   Because it's not the same.
Sharon Leu:  Same as Netflix telling me to watch a show and I 
  thumbs-down it there's very rarely a feedback loop back to the 
  algorithm to say whether this was a good bad or okay 
  recommendation the second thing is what does a wallet see about 
  you and does the wallet give you the ability to withhold the 
  information so can the maker can Patagonia look inside my 
  backpack do I give it permission what can it see I think the same 
  applies which is why I'm like I do like.
Sharon Leu:   A lot the idea.
Sharon Leu:  Elected with closure that David mentioned earlier so 
  I just I think that this is an interesting idea of the skills I 
  think is it the most important thing I don't know I can be 
  convinced and but do I think it opens up a conversation about 
  what else is make some more robust verifiable credentials 
  ecosystem I think absolutely so I don't know that doesn't answer 
  the question but I feel like those in my my rants about it.
Harrison_Tang: Great thanks Frank.
Frank_Cicio: Yeah hi can you hear me.
Frank_Cicio: Great Sharon great presentation great effort on jmf 
  I really think it's very important to verify information it's a 
  growing need it's out there players are looking for that 
  Educators as well as the individuals in terms of the question I 
  was asked on skills so I Q4 we have spent a lot of time on the 
  digging deep into solving.
Frank_Cicio: Old problem and that skills problem it does get down 
  to that level of granularity I forget who it was who brought up 
  the the comment before in the OSN the open skills Network that's 
  referred to as Rich skill descriptors and the nice framework for 
  example in some security it's referred to as knowledge skills and 
  abilities this is what we call a tear for skill meaning it's a 
  descriptor of somebody's knowledge or ability or skill.
Frank_Cicio:  to do.
Frank_Cicio: I think it's also similar to a job requisition task 
  so as you all know organizations spend a lot of time describing 
  what they're looking for and those are descriptors they're not 
  just a single word and also similar to what we see as learning 
  outcomes for curriculum so what's the common thread through all 
  of this it is a level of granularity that's common among 
  curriculum.
Frank_Cicio:  job requirements.
Frank_Cicio: And individual's ability and bringing that together 
  is is absolutely critical and not using a i necessarily but using 
  a robust data schema data model that provides multiple texts on 
  Emmy's to interoperate together so that at the end of the day if 
  I upload a credential from Western Governors University or from 
  any.
Frank_Cicio: Parse that data into a level of granularity that 
  really can describe what I'm capable of doing there's two parts 
  to that okay if we look at the RSD S1 is a direct correlation 
  between the metadata in that credential because a lot of 
  credentials do have that level of granularity into the skills of 
  that individual the other component is it may not.
Frank_Cicio:  not have that.
Frank_Cicio: Hilarity it may need to cross-reference credential 
  engine and the registry in the metadata located there so we can 
  then extrapolate that information and compare it to some tech 
  sodomy standard or at least some taxonomy that's similar to the 
  skills and the content that's related to that credentials so to 
  wrap it up I do agree with you the next step really is.
Frank_Cicio: These credentials into a level of granularity that 
  could be understood between Educators individuals and employers I 
  hope that helps a little bit.
Sharon Leu:  You know I actually wasn't suggesting oh sorry 
  Kimberly I but but it and I just wanted to clarify wasn't 
  necessarily suggesting that like skills is where the next 
  plugfest is going because actually wants was thinking that we 
  would keep it on the technical interoperable the credential 
  itself.
Sharon Leu:  Got it yes yep.
Frank_Cicio: Height and Sharon I didn't mean that wasn't pointed 
  at the next step that was pointed there was another lady that I 
  brought up she looked at our SDS and was just wondering World War 
  would get that that that's where I was focused on that sorry 
  about that that I should have made that call.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah so I just want to make a note on kind of 
  skills data so I'm at company Spokeo for talent analytics we just 
  use LinkedIn telling insights data so actually knows people from 
  LinkedIn working on that project so they do a lot of etls and 
  data standardization so if you go to LinkedIn and then in a 
  skills section all the skills and you can be very very granular.
Harrison_Tang:  or like by granular.
Harrison_Tang: II meant you're going to a job development snow 
  and then even more granular than that all the skills actually are 
  standardized to Wikipedia definitions so that's how much time 
  resources and effort they put into cleaning and standardizing the 
  skills data so so that's what we use because when we first trying 
  to do data analysis on skills data and by the way skills are.
Harrison_Tang:  Define as.
Harrison_Tang: What people know right so it's different from 
  experience we call it experience which actually mapped to work 
  education achievements and and also different from competencies 
  which is like basically behaviors and how you do things like so 
  just leadership and so on so on so skills we defined as what 
  people know when we're doing data analysis standardizations would 
  realize that linking data is actually the best so just want to 
  share that little knowledge.
Harrison_Tang: All right any other comments.
Kimberly Linson:  So I just want to add in Sharon I'm sorry to 
  kind of do real this on the skills but I do think one of the 
  things that it has brought to my mind is that you know we already 
  have a place in in the credential to make these links to two 
  credential engine Rich skill descriptors and and that's on need 
  to maybe make better use of that but I do I do want to ask you 
  just sort of I know we're approaching the end of time so.
Kimberly Linson:   You know what can we as a community.
Kimberly Linson:  Provide for you to sort of help you make a 
  decision around you know the focus of plugfest for and then I 
  guess my like selfish question is and do you have any like ideas 
  around like when you think plugfest for will it be the spring 
  will it be fall will it be 25 just as you know it's the time of 
  year we're all thinking about our 24 road maps.
Sharon Leu:  Got it yes that's a great question I wish I had a 
  more clear answer for you but on our team's roadmap is in the 
  spring we're actually going to do a refresh of our digital 
  wallets markets can and we're going to take a slightly different 
  approach this is not going to be are there more verifiable 
  credential while it's in the ecosystem the question that we're 
  going to ask is in developing this markets being we identified 
  four areas of impact that we thought could really.
Sharon Leu:   We make a difference for our particular use case.
Sharon Leu:  And they involve you know I will drop the link and I 
  cannot do this very quickly but what we're looking at is a little 
  bit more of an exploration of how to identify that those are the 
  characteristics whether they are the correct ones and how you 
  might Implement if you are an implementer that hasn't done that 
  yet or how you might procure something that has those 
  characteristics so it'll be more a deep dive into like wallet 
  anatomy and physiology.
Sharon Leu:   She then it.
Sharon Leu:  Be a refresh Loom Escape so that's what we have 
  coming in the spring also coming in the spring what we're doing 
  is we have we have contracted with a survey firm to do a survey 
  of job Seekers to get a sense for with the population who has 
  done a job search within the last 6 months how many of them were 
  able to use a digital credential in that process when and how and 
  whether they use digital wallets we think that will be a really 
  interesting.
Sharon Leu:   Nation since there have previously been surveys 
  around.
Sharon Leu:  Consider non resume non transcript information in 
  their hiring as well as surveys of institutions of higher 
  education for what they issue so we think that will really round 
  out our picture of you know the scalability of this and so then 
  as a result of that our team is a little bit busy through the 
  spring and we might do this we might kick it off in the summer 
  for fall again.
Sharon Leu:  How to contribute this seems like far away but 
  actually preparing the resources for something like this does 
  take a minute so I would love for you know people to have a 
  conversation about this I can kick it off I think I'll what I can 
  do is I will reply all to the thread with the recording and the 
  slides and we can have a conversation on the listserv about that 
  or everyone is welcome to send me an email with your thoughts and 
  perhaps we'll have you know an open sort of webinar.
Sharon Leu:   Type discussion in early 20:24 to continue this 
  conversation.
Harrison_Tang: Great thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Yellow last questions or comments.
<sharon_leu> Thanks for hosting me! Please send a note if you 
  have thoughts: sleu@jff.org
Harrison_Tang: All right so we're at time so thank you Sharon for 
  jumping on and actually great presentations and less was like 
  leading this discussion in regards to the clock best the 
  summarizing the last three Professor so I was like previewing 
  what my cam in the future so thanks a lot alright so just before 
  we conclude this one give a quick shout-out to will again thank 
  you for being the co-chair and.
Harrison_Tang:  joining me and Camberley to help.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> Thanks all!
Harrison_Tang: D together and then as I mentioned earlier just 
  long solicit developer volunteers to help us build a script to 
  automate the process of publishing the video recordings and 
  that's it so this concludes this week's ccg meeting so thanks for 
  hopping on have a good one.
<frank_cicio> thank you
