[2023-06-20T16:27:30.816Z]	<PL/T3-ASU>	Q re: credential wallets
[2023-06-20T16:27:45.081Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q+
[2023-06-20T16:27:54.658Z]	<Transcriber>	PL/T3-ASU: Yes hi can you hear me I believe you said that you are also providing a hosted Carlyle credential wallet on your platform as well as the sdks for separate wallets is that correct.
[2023-06-20T16:28:31.423Z]	<Transcriber>	PL/T3-ASU: So the question the question then is typically when one is receiving a credential into one's wallet there is a best practice that you validate the verify the credential that's being sent to you if that is part of a platform are you paying for that verification to receive it.
[2023-06-20T16:28:59.384Z]	<Transcriber>	PL/T3-ASU: Oh yeah so you don't yet verify on receipt at this point okay that's good clarification thank you.
[2023-06-20T16:29:27.323Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Yep I have a question United States like employment screening is governed by fcra federal yeah Credit Reporting Act Right so so how and it and that this area has several requirements this is data accuracy requirements of adverse action notices and things like that so how how do you get compliant with fcra here.
[2023-06-20T16:29:28.282Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q-
[2023-06-20T16:30:14.073Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you.
[2023-06-20T16:30:47.946Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: And also I have a follow-up question in regards to employment screening use case so let's just say like I'm not back that actor I have a lot of criminal records for example right but then in a in the SSI kind of Paradigm I don't have a lot of incentives to show that to to share my criminal records or court records with with my the potential employer right so so how do we kind of get around that like how do.
[2023-06-20T16:30:48.316Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang:  we because yeah.
