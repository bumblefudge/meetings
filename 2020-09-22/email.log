Topic: Progress on Action Items

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Issue - synthesize what is in a wallet into 
  a report.  can we close? Heather pulled together a lot of 
  material. If it is going to move forward it needs owners for it.
Heather Vescent:  We had a positive response to what is a wallet 
  and we wanted to capture the information beyond the wallet.
Heather Vescent:  It was suggested that a more detailed 
  overviewed or recap could be made.  There were some people who 
  thought that was a good idea. We have satisfied the initial 
  issue.
Manu Sporny: +1 To avoid scope creep.
Anil John: Speaking of Digital Wallets, the UI/UX Competition 
  being sponsored by DHS/SVIP is now open -- Details at 
  https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/prize-competitions
Manu Sporny: And have focused issues that have resolutions.
Anil John: We will be sure to point the applicants to the CCG 
  Digital Wallet resources and report.
Heather Vescent:  If there is someone who wants to take ownership 
  and write a report that could work.
Anil John: We will announce the 3 Stage 1 winners at a community 
  engagement event. Free registration @

Phil Archer: Yes
Looks great!
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Andi Hindle
Andi: works in identity for 14 years and chairs the content 
  committee at Identiverse and participates in a range of standards 
  groups mostly lurking
Andi: moments to orient to Identiverse, overview of some of the 
  key things touched on, wrap up with a brief introduction next 
  year.
Andi: originated in 2010 as the cloud identity summit - founder 
  and CEO of PingIdentity still founding sponsor. Run as an 
  industry conference
Andi: the core focus is identity touching on security and privacy 
  too. More conference heavy then expo heavy.
Andi: 2020 we were originally planned to be in Denver - needed 
  refactoring.
Andi: everyone had to work out the best way to do this. We had a 
  good fortune to follow IIW.
Andi: we had 80 hours of programmed conference - we spread out 
  the conference over 8 weeks with presentations each day - virtual 
  networking in the sessions and outside of the sessions.
Andi: Pre-record the presentations.
Andi: Highlights it is tricky to do this. 80 hours of content is 
  a lot and kind of impossible to cover a lot.
Andi: a lot of over lap with the statistics - most viewed and 
  watched. Tried to pick a few things from each of the major topic 
  areas.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I'm back
Moses Ma: Bug: recording stopped and restarted
Andi: left happens every year
Andi: Right hand side topics we typically cover but at variousing 
  levels of amount.
Andi: UX at the top was a thematic focus for the year. We were 
  trying to make sure we covered it.
Andi: Has taken a screen shot of the topics in the 
  user-experience area.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Anil, I meant to repeat what you posted about 
  the wallet competition. We can remind everyone at the end of the 
  call
Andi: This topic infused many other topics.
Thanks for your patience Andi
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Anil -- can we add it to our 
  announcements&reminders page?
Andi: was good to get folks from outside of identity, security, 
  privacy - group of UX researchers at google - trying to 
  understand how people interact with identity systems.
Andi: not everyone uses identity the way that identity people 
  think about identity - has real implications for how people use 
  it for real use-cases. Not just enteprise setting.
Andi: As soon as you get outside Enterprise systems you have real 
  challenges.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Sorry, just saw Manu's comment. My computer 
  crashed the second Andi started speaking. And yes, we are 
  exploring whether Anil's webcam was involved
Andi: Where is the User in User Experience? By ____. also had 
  good things to share.
Andi: Privacy is something we covered with ethics and governance.
Andi: ISC and IAPP for CECs.
Andi: Hard in virtual content - want to make exciting and 
  engaging. We are fortunate to have a number of people who are 
  outstanding presentors. Making things that get issues across in 
  interesting ways.
Andi: Jeremy Grant gave a good presentations about challenges of 
  CCPA - using rock songs.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: /Me  :heart:
Andi: Katherine Harrison gave a good presentation on deep fakes.
Andi: Trust in what we see, trust in what we hear, this has a big 
  role.
Andi: security takes up a lot of the overall agenda time. it is 
  tricky.
Andi: its all about security.
Andi: Deep dive stuff - homomorphic encryption is it real through 
  to more practical things Privileged Access Management.
Andi: Neshant gave a very real mission impossible talk through 
  myths and realities.
Andi: Alex Winer at MSFT gave a real time demo of how identity 
  systems get compromised to understand the risks.
Andi: Authorization as a topic - this has a lot of active work 
  now. Activity in the standards space and solving deployment 
  issues.
Andi: not totally surprising
Andi: Standards is core to what we do each here - there are a lot 
  of standards there is an incresing number. We can't cover 
  everything every year. if you look at it across 2-3 years.
Andi: some come and then go away - then come back once they are 
  in deployments.
Andi: why didn't cover verifiable credentials stuff? was touched 
  on a few presentations.
Andi: had some coverage decentralized digital identity mostly 
  from a OpenID presentations.
Andi: So how architecture and deployments tends to be where we 
  get the standards and solidified and reified in architecthures 
  and deployment along with real experiments with axilary things. 
  Thomson Rueters did a very interesting experiment he shared about 
  multiple clouds.
Andi: Practical examples from EA.
Andi: very interesting from industry as a whole. understanding 
  the us-cases is telling.
Andi: how they are having to stich them together. Another one 
  pulled out here - panel on scaling strong authentication - mainly 
  around FIDO.
Andi: one of the challenges medium to almost large enterprise. As 
  soon as you look at it on a consume scale or global enterprise 
  scale. Token delivery, token replacement. Someone at NIST 
  suggested we hold a panel about this. To talk about this in 
  forums that the industry as a whole can start to particiapte.
Andi: Good presentation from ____ workday
Andi: Steve Wilson gave a deep thoughtful provoking talk - 
  Identity as data.
Andi: What it is the industry can and does do for them.
Heather Vescent: Awe - thanks Andi! ps. all images in the deck 
  are from GITS!
Andi: Heather gave a presentation on deep fakes with a different 
  perspective.
Andi: we had headliner presentation some but not all would be 
  keynotes. Ian Glazer
Andi: his presentation was on the future of identity next 10-15 
  years. has a large volume of slides.
Andi: a number of panels - looking at identity privacy and 
  security and how they fit together don't fit together.
Andi: series of interviews with Henry Rawlands - punk rocker - 
  broadcaster.
Andi: he did interviews with several folks.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: S/Rawlands/Rollins
Andi: Getting folks to engage hard so an interview with him was a 
  way to get them to present.
Andi: wasn't quite the same as being in person
Andi: covered topics on diversity and eithics.
Andi: Andre and Esther Dyson had a great conversation
Question: where can we see the presentations - are they on 
  youtube?
Andi: Next year - dates are set 20-23 of June and if we can - 
  some part will be in physical format - likely virtual too.
Andi: Call for presentations is open in October.
Andi:  New archive on identiverse.com
Adrian Hope-Bailie:  Any impression on human centered design.
Adrian Hope-Bailie:  Yes and no
Andi: yes and no - trite response we have a lot of work to do as 
  an industry.
Great recap Andi!
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Identiverse on youtube: 
  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUOo7SSG-a4yk8-11kPDKqg
Andi: helping people to understand how to deal with a 
  passwordless universe - consumers are not near this. We have for 
  20 years trained them to have strong passwords.
Andi: When you take them to a passwordless environment - that 
  can't be safe - a lot of training work to do - the other thing 
  emerging around decentralized identity - we need to clear we are 
  solving problems people actually care about.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: +1
Andi: that is worth baring in mind. We have run into it in some 
  of the other user-centric work.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Thank you Andi. Thank you Kaliya for 
  scribing.
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Anil there is a wallet design competition 
  going on.
