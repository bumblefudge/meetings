Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Okay I think.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh hopefully you'll you'll be joining shortly.
Kaliya Young:  Hi um I'll just share that we have the internet 
  identity Workshop coming up in April.
Kaliya Young:  From the 16th to the 18th in Mountain View 
  California.
Kaliya Young:  We have the digital identity unconference Europe.
Kaliya Young:  The 18th to the 20th of June in Zurich.
Kaliya Young:  And did unconference Africa the 25th to 27th in 
  South Africa.
Kaliya Young:  And we're still finalizing a date for the AP pack 
  digital identity unconference in Thailand and January 2025.
Kaliya Young:  And all those are unconference is run the way IBEW 
  runs with the agenda co-created live the day of the event.
Kaliya Young:  Our goal is really to support.
Kaliya Young:  Regional conversations um that feel like they're 
  needed as the Technologies expand and go out into the real world.
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> I can't see Phil on the Participant list.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh thank you so much Simone for the for the 
  recap uh couple of questions 1 is about the trusted metadata uh 
  project that you mentioned at the end is that.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.):  is that sort of.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): The required fields.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Open badges spec has right now.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): I see I see.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Got it so it's definitely something to keep an 
  eye on okay uh and then my my other question was uh you mentioned 
  employment uh Records so which which has been uh definitely on my 
  mind uh as I'm involved in a couple of projects that are data 
  modeling sort of verifiable employment credentials and so.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): My question is has there been much 
  conversation about the.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Side of things rather than the traditional 
  education side that 1 at Tech uh engages in.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Yeah absolutely I think that would be that 
  would be really helpful of us here at VC edu to.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh at least start discussing if not even uh 
  data modeling some um.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Verifiable employment examples uh taking a 
  look at some of the older diff work.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): That LinkedIn may or may not uh be also using 
  uh some of.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): The schema.org approach the uh HR open lrrs 
  approaches to employment credentials and so on yeah so that's 
  that's definitely something that I'm looking forward to in this 
  community.
<gillan_ward> As part of pre-employment checks for onboarding in 
  the UK NHS we have defined data schemas for verifying both 
  employment and references
<dmitri_z._(pres.)> @Gillian - oh! that's great. are there any 
  links to schemas we can look at?
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): A Gillian in chat or uh or Jillian um in chat 
  mentioned that uh the UK NHS.
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> That sounds interesting, @Gillan.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh data schema ecosystem may have uh.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Verify employment and reference uh.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Credentials schemas so that'll be really 
  interesting.
<gillan_ward> It's Gillan - I will see what we can share
<gillan_ward> It should be being published soon
<dmitri_z._(pres.)> @Gillan ahhh thanks! misread that extra i :)
<gillan_ward> ;-)
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Anybody else um any any other questions about.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh the 1 at that conversation.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Alternatively uh if.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): If you're working on a project uh that that is 
  interested in.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh verified employment verified resumes that 
  sort of thing uh please hop on a queue tell us about it uh.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): It's good to hear um feedback and other voices 
  on on the topic.
<gillan_ward> happy to share a breif update
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Colin go ahead.
<dmitri_z._(pres.)> @Gillan - please do! hop on the queue!
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Hello hello uh thanks for calling 
  that out explicitly Demetrius most directly the lrrs the resume 
  standard that open HR has been uh working on I think is of 
  interest to some of our.
Simone Ravaoli: 
  https://www.1edtech.org/1edtech-article/1edtech-and-hr-open-improve-learning-to-employment-with-updated-standard/410921
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Employer Partners through you know 
  there's a lot of conversation at least in the states around 
  skills first tiring and skills first practices to remove uh 
  specifically to remove the degree requirement from a lot of um 
  application processes uh I think something in this whole 
  conversation around digital credentials and uh ler's uh that 
  arises for employers is sort of a standard or or way they can 
  think about the next iteration and the irony is not lost on me 
  when they ask about a standard for something even though they use 
  a self created resume currently um but the lrs the resume 
  standard I think is growing um in interest and smart resume as a 
  partner that we work with who has a.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Basically a version of that that 
  can present verified credentials with the verification layer 
  baked in but can also export as a PDF for you know traditional 
  hiring processes but it proposes to plug into any system and 
  offer representation of those verified credentials in 1 vehicle 
  and I know they participated in you know the pokefest of the past 
  but I think that's an area where we're seeing a lot of interest 
  from Partners in in our projects and we've sort of 2 projects 1's 
  called The Last Mile the higher that we have uh I've mentioned 
  here before but we are looking at a next phase of that that would 
  engage employers more directly in that in that hiring process so 
  we've gone through an understanding phase with some some big 
  Employers in the states uh.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  to understand.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Understand what those challenges.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: In the hiring process in 
  upskilling uh because and so I think having some kind of standard 
  or some kind of signal at least for them.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Mint or the.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Of all these.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: In in that.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Out their HR.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Systems can accept credentials and 
  unpack the data that's inside of them is a separate question but 
  at least showing the layer of verification and showing this that 
  skills and and other attestations have been validated um through 
  the whether it's working you know the experience they have as an 
  employee uh or its experiences that they're gaining through 
  non-degree or not credit courses um has the interest there has 
  really has really increased at least with the partners we've been 
  talking to so.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  all that.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Is really valuable.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Um because really a lot of these 
  groups want to see something that is simple and easy that that 
  contains all of all of this stuff so.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  that's what.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Just a little.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: And happy to talk more.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Anyone who is.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Side of the world.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Reports that I'm happy to share.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: If people are interested.
David Ward:  Can can you hear me okay yeah.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): We can yes and how do we how do we pronounce 
  your name again.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Gillan got it.
David Ward:  It's it's Gillan Gillan yeah it's an unusual name a 
  place in Cornwall in the UK yeah.
David Ward:  You all uh yeah so so I I I'll try and be brief um 
  basically in the NHS which is the National Health Service in the 
  UK we're looking to create a digital staff passport which is a 
  wallet a digital wallet which will hold verifiable credentials 
  it's already um in be public beta now um and the idea is to get 
  Health Care Professionals onto the ward working the first phase 
  of the project is about pre-employment checks which includes 
  right to work checks criminal record checks identity checks um 
  employment checks um and and there's some more and then there's 
  other checks that they do which are statutory mandatory training 
  they have to do education checks which is why I I I sort of 
  joined this forum in the first place.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> For those unfamiliar, this is the 
  LER-RS I mentioned: https://www.hropenstandards.org/ler-rs
David Ward:  And then ultimately it's all about access to 
  locations and systems um so they they can work on the ward ugh 
  for the for the uh in in the UK we have about 10,000.
David Ward:   Um different.
David Ward:  Legal entities that doctors and Health Care 
  Professionals can move between each time they have a legal op 
  obligation to do a lot of these checks.
David Ward:  Um um when you have doctors in training uh or 
  post-graduate training as part of their work in hospitals they 
  have to move between you know 4 months stints where they move 
  between different hospitals to get their training and each time 
  they need a reference um and um you know historically it's taken 
  a long time for Consultants to provide references to the doctors 
  in training um and sometimes they can't remember because there 
  might be 50 or 60 per person of rotation and then the doctors 
  come back and ask 4 months down the line they can't remember so 
  the 1 of the most important ones was this reference so it's very 
  much in this context within the NHS however because um we have to 
  employ people from outside of the UK and ultimately he'd go and 
  work elsewhere it's both public and private sector.
David Ward:  Um so yeah so so lots to talk about but I I just 
  wanted to give you a quick update and I'll share we're publishing 
  the we wrote takes a long time it's public sector so we we 
  published um our trust framework with all the data specifications 
  for all of the verifiable credentials that we have currently um 
  and they should be available very soon it's taken about 3 years 
  to actually get them published but yeah that's great update thank 
  you very much.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Thank you so much Galen uh quick quick 
  question is uh is this project related to the uh.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): To some of the solid bod initiatives uh NHS.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Was experimenting with.
David Ward:  No it's separate it's separate from that so this is 
  all about digital wallets and um verify the credentials not 
  solids not not.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): And is is a targeting a mobile wallet or a web 
  based wallet.
David Ward:  A mobile it says very much focused on the mobile at 
  the moment as you're aware the the NHS is allegedly the fifth 
  largest employer in the world so there's lots of different 
  entities who have different initiatives um across it but we're 
  working with NHS England which is the 1 that um comes directly 
  from the Department of Health down so um.
David Ward:  That's what it's doing yeah.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Sounds great yeah please uh keep keep us 
  updated on how that goes I think a lot of us here would be really 
  interested uh in that project.
David Ward:  I will thanks.
<gillan_ward> Happy to
<gillan_ward> Will keep you posted
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): So can you say more uh portability in what 
  sense.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Yeah I'm I'm curious about.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): What 1 AD Tech is going to do with uh their 
  badge connect as well because I think the the overall verified 
  credential ecosystem uh has standard portability.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Protocols like the open ID and VC API uh 
  family of protocols so I I think the larger Community is just not 
  familiar with the badge connect API.
Simone Ravaoli: 
  https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/DCsummit2020/Pitcher_Otto-Badge%20Connect%20API.pdf
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Given that 1 adtech open Badges and CLR 
  version 2.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh have have moved to verify the credentials 
  on the data model.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): There's there's no real reason.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): For them not to embrace the uh verify the 
  credential protocols as well right like if you're a new 
  developer.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Or new Implement sorry.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh entering into the badge space.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): He is there any incentive to implement the 
  badge connect API.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): I think that'll be 1 of the main questions.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh for 1 a deck 2.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Sort out an answer.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Yeah sounds good.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh all right so we can we can wrap up this 
  call Early uh although there there's something else we wanted to 
  at least start the conversation about and that is the.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Subscribing aspect of our calls.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): The the chairs have been.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Talking about is it time to.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): For for those.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): For those unfamiliar uh ccg.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): I would say it's a couple years ago.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): To scribe its calls manually right so there's 
  there's always at the beginning of every call the dreaded call 
  prescribes.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Which is both.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Which is a mixed blessing.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): It's always hard to do and sometimes the 
  transcription quality is uneven but at least you've got a human 
  on the transcribing end and the notes are pretty good.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh given the Scribe selection difficulty uh 
  the ccg has moved towards this uh.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Out that this current transcriber technology 
  which is locally hosted and I believe uses like a free Google API 
  to to do the voice recognition.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh so so the current infrastructure is.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Sort of evolved this way due to uh privacy and 
  open source concerns.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): On uh on the part of the.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh group members.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): But we wanted to restart the conversation and 
  get us start getting a sense from the audience of.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Switch to some.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Would anybody have strong objections to that 
  would it be a deal-breaker for anyone.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): So if you have thoughts on this uh please hop 
  on the queue.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Lico go ahead.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Thank you so much ELO.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Oh that that's weird I maybe 
  forgot to put my take my name out of there but I yeah no we we 
  use it all the time internally for a lot of our team meetings and 
  some of the reports are super valuable especially for.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Um like quick summaries of 
  meetings right as opposed to reading through the whole transcript 
  I think some of the summaries that that provides a pretty great 
  so all in favor.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Most importantly uh does anybody have else 
  have strong objections.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): All right that's uh that's good to know it's a 
  it's a good data point.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): I also pick up this conversation on on the 
  mailing list uh and in the call in 15 minutes but this is a great 
  uh.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Which is yeah that's not good at all and I 
  think it didn't catch elico either.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Yeah it didn't it didn't transcribe when it 
  would go was speaking so there's definitely weird Network 
  partition stuff going on.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): That would be good to smooth out.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): All right so we uh so we adjourn uh for a few 
  minutes before uh.
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Maybe the transcriber only likes persons and 
  not chairs ;-). Although it likes you, Dmitri.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Before doing another call for the for the 
  Europeans okay.
<dmitri_z._(pres.)> @Ildiko see? it's confusing! :)
Simone Ravaoli: https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/join
<xavi_aracil_(1edtech)> I'd add ELM as well
Simone Ravaoli: +1 Xavi, let's unpack this in a minute.
https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/DCsummit2020/Pitcher_Otto-Badge%20Connect%20API.pdf
<phil_long_(t3)> @Simone - absolutely, the ELM represents the 
  EU/EC's domain specific credential payloads about aspects of an 
  individual re: learning and employment.
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Currently in ELM we capture employment 
  related skills and competences as learning outcomes coming from 
  in-service learning.
<phil_long_(t3)> @Simone - Edalex is adding the content 
  management layer to evidence.
<phil_long_(t3)> :+1: Xavi re: protocol distinctions from 
  platform tranfers vs. wallet to endpoint .
<phil_long_(t3)> @Xavi is pointing out an important need to 
  communicate/interpret/underatand the technical aspects of LER/VCs 
  in more generally accessible language.
<phil_long_(t3)> @Xavi and @Rob can you also talk about the 
  trusted micro-credential initiative?
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> I'd really like to be here for 
  the rest of this discussion, but with the time change I have a 
  conflict for the second half- thanks all!
<dmitri_z._(pres.)> thanks Deb!
Simone Ravaoli: https://www.1edtech.org/program/tmc
https://credentialengine.org/2024/02/26/navigating-the-micro-credential-landscape-a-global-mapping-initiative/
<simone> thanks Deb, I will make sure to cover the 
  microcredential mapping exercise
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> and a resource for meaningful 
  credentials including CTDL 
  https://credentialengine.org/resources/how-to-align-digital-credentials-with-meaningful-ctdl-data/
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> sorry I have to go
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> We do the same here in Europe when it comes 
  to Micro-credentials. See Annex 1 of 
  https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9237-2022-INIT/en/pdf
<dmitri_z._(pres.)> @Ildiko - ooh, page 15 of that PDF is 
  fascinating, in that it lists 11 required fields for each 
  micro-credential
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Page 27 (Annex 1) has that all beautifully 
  tabled.
<dmitri_z._(pres.)> nice!!
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> This is the table I had side by side with 
  https://www.1edtech.org/program/tmc when I compared the two.
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Continued conversation is crucial
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Interoperability is not just a technical 
  question, it's also semantics and definitions of terms.
https://www.1edtech.org/event/europe/2024
Simone Ravaoli: 
  https://europa.eu/europass/en/stakeholders/european-digital-credentials
<xavi_aracil_(1edtech)> ELM Browser: 
  https://europa.eu/europass/elm-browser/index.html
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Thanks for pasting in the ELMB link, @Xavi 
  :-)
<eric_shepherd> lol
<eric_shepherd> jim Goodell - led the schema standard
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> I'm not a formal representative of ESCO, but 
  I'd be happy to share some thoughts and experiences with using 
  ESCO in ELM and European Digital Credentials.
https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/case
<rob_coyle> Competency and Academic Standards Exchange (CASE)
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Same for ELM
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Indeed, I think this is very important to 
  mix the use of popular frameworks/taxonomies and 'own' lists.
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> :-) I wanted to ask the same question.
<phil_barker> There is a ESCO - ONET crosswalk, I think at 
  https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/about-esco/data-science-and-esco/crosswalk-between-esco-and-onet
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Advantage of Linked Open Data is that 
  concepts from different frameworks can be mapped with each other.
<laura_paglione> can you please update the offical calendar?
<laura_paglione> ty!
<xavi_aracil_(1edtech)> thank you!
<ildiko_mazar_(elm)> Bye
