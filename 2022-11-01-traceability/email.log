https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/405
Ben: Switching to trace interop issues, only 15
Orie Steele:  Hasn't had document in w3c that'd allow it to 
  represent w3c creds
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/448
Ben: No action to take then, leaving comment
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/449

https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/427
Ben: 427, opened by Orie
Orie Steele:  In our tests two DID methods, DID key & DID web
Ben: Do we want to have list of specific DID methods, "trace 
  interoep API expects these several DID methods"?
Orie Steele:  Require DID Web today. Question is i we want 
  anything else?
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/431
Paul: Want clarity, most important
Ben: Moving on, 431, Chris
Chris: This is placeholder, discussed several weeks ago
Ben: Noting you were out and will follow up
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/364
Chris: Self-assigning
Ben: Next, issue 364
Chris: Been around a while, purpose make sure we don't lose track 
  of need for browsable index of test results
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/371
Ben: Moving on to PR 371
Chris: This one, we should publish minutes to mailing list, link 
  to that in minutes, as other groups do
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/402
Ben: If no issue to raise by anyone, moving on
Ben: 402, Orie, who just left
Nis: No, though great idea
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/359
Ben: Continuing on to 359
Chris: Another placeholder. We need a few additional tests for 
  positive testing, assigned to me, adding comment
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/307
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/363
Ben: 307, top level README, assigning self + making internal 
  ticket
Chris: Another one on plate when left, need better links to 
  Postman collections for performance reliability
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/438
Ben: On to 438
Ted Thibodeau:  You could make this special agenda item to bubble 
  to top next time before Orie's conflict startss
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/439
Ben: Adding note & pinging in Slack
Chris: Came from recent decision for manual scribing, need to 
  update READMEs to document manual scribe procedure
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/401
Ben: 401, Nis?
Nis: I think we can close, with comment
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/447
Ben: Last issue in trace intereop, 447
Chris: Initial issue, did not allow VCs to be string in 
  conformance testss
Chris: Decided to leave, bc still would throw error
Chris: This is a negative test, designed to fail, or request is 
  designed to fail so this should pass
Ben: So we get a string, take a look, say "does this parse as 
  JWT"
Chris: That's my suggestion for [?]. This should fail regardless 
  though. Literal string not a valid value, so req should fail, 
  test should pass
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/448
Ben: Action item, follow up see if we can address
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues/449
Ben: Nis, two you were pinged for, 448 and 449
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/issues/521
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/issues/427
Ben: That concludes trace interop issues
Ben: Next, 427, Ted?
Ted Thibodeau:  We've got a bunch of fake data, trying to be fake 
  but not going in right direction to be fake
Ted Thibodeau:  With phone numbers, people run tests
Russell: Would prefer not to sync first 3 digits with cities
<chris_abernethy> Cell phones very frequently do not match the 
  actual location
Chris: Echoing Russell and Nis, don't think it's worth the hassle 
  of looking up area codes
Chris: I'll post minutes
