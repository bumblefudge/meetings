Topic: Introductions and reintroductions

<marty_reed> Good morning, Marty Reed with Randa solutions.
<kimhd> Kerri, can I call on you to reintroduce yourself.
<kerri_lemoie> My name is Kerri Lemoie, and I'm from open works 
  group and I've been working in an open badges and EdTech for a 
  little bit over a decade. And now I'm transitioning from a 
  technologist to do more research. So I need to know everything 
  that's going on all the time about the standards so I can like 
  understand it and do the best research.

Topic: working session modeling verifiable credentials for education

<kimhd> One thing I wanted to start with was
<kimhd> As we progress further we're developing several 
  artifacts. One of these is the VC EDU models spec. And I think, 
  to the discussion last week, a lot of additional topics have 
  gotten pulled into the draft spec that we can possibly move 
  outside other work items of the task force and actually let me go 
  ahead and include the direct link.
<kimhd> First, there's a high level topic of scope. Representing 
  skills, some more formal education, like a diploma and then 
  informal education like webinar attendance.
<kimhd> Within that there are several issues that would end up 
  being maybe too low level. So for that work items -- possibly out 
  of scope for that document. So some things might include the XML 
  mapping work that we have to do to make verifiable credentials 
  usable as XML and actually I can paste these in as up potentially 
  out of scope.
<kimhd> And it's possible Anthony's PR will address some of this. 
  So maybe I'll come back to this. So I would possibly propose that 
  out of scope for this document will include things like details 
  of the XML mapping, because that's going to be a PR against the 
  VC maintenance charter group.
<kimhd> General solutions for things like image integrity. So 
  this is something we talked about last week, which is people will 
  be representing images in different ways, whether it's HTML, SVG, 
  PDF, maybe links to an image that's hosted somewhere, but then 
  also there's the concept of integrity of that image so general 
  solutions for things like that might be out of scope. Oh, and 
  then also PDF as a container I would recommend is out of scope. I 
  think what I'm getting at here is that we might think of what 
  we're focusing on in this initial document is more a descriptive 
  versus some of these other things get into more prescriptive and 
  then those are the things that will require their own efforts to 
  iterate around like image integrity. How do we represent the 
  general notion of that and we're not saying prescriptive.
<kimhd> For a broad set of of people using verifiable 
  credentials, just in terms of if you want to maximize 
  interoperability for wallet users, things like that. These are 
  our recommended practices. So I'm just going to add those next. 
  Let me turn to	Anthony's PR
<kimhd> Anthony, can I call on you to talk to this.
<anthonycamilleri> So if you could just call it down a little bit 
  more. So the green part can all be in there are sorry for getting 
  this everyone so late.
<anthonycamilleri> So what I tried to do
<anthonycamilleri> To do was describe what at least from my point 
  of view, are the basic concepts we need to include
<anthonycamilleri> I very purposely didn't name the concepts, so 
  that we wouldn't,for example, have problems about what does 
  credential engine call a credential versus W3C calls a 
  credential, etc. If we agree on the concepts we can name them 
  anything under the sun.
<anthonycamilleri> To my point of view, there are four concepts 
  that we need in an educational space. The first concept describes 
  an activity, somebody has done.
<anthonycamilleri> They performed Beethoven's six symphony, they 
  attended a conference, they spent six years working as a lion 
  tamer
<anthonycamilleri> Things they have done and it's really just 
  things this person has done -- that's it.
<anthonycamilleri> Secondly, the second concept.
<anthonycamilleri> Would be a learning outcome or a skill and 
  well you know how long people in education argue about difference 
  between those two. And I really don't want to get into it.
<anthonycamilleri> But examples of this concept would be piano 
  playing, advanced woodworking, or if you imagine something in a 
  more learning outcome Format, work in accordance with established 
  sustainability. But these are all the learning outcomes skills, 
  etc.
<anthonycamilleri> Um, the third concept basically describes the 
  outcome of a formal assessment process. And it's very much 
  oriented toward formal education and examples of this bachelor's 
  in sociology a Microsoft certification.
<anthonycamilleri> A certificate that says you're a member of the 
  bar. These kinds of things,
<anthonycamilleri> And then the fourth one described a person's 
  participation or membership in an educational activity. So an 
  example might include that you are students of the University of 
  Wine country, you're an apprentice lawyer with the California Bar 
  Association, etc, etc. 
<anthonycamilleri> Things to note about these concepts. First of 
  all, all these concepts can be related to one another. So, for 
  example, a bachelor's in sociology
<anthonycamilleri> can include the acquisition of the skill of 
  sociological research, it can have been performed after
<anthonycamilleri> 500 hours of fieldwork practice while being a 
  student of the University of Orlando. Ah, so let's say all of 
  these concepts quoted as saying include relational fields to each 
  other. 
<anthonycamilleri> The second part of this is the approach to 
  defining this and let's say this is kind of a mix. It's a bit of 
  a hybrid of the examples that were provided below. So, what you 
  find is that
<anthonycamilleri> You could talk about all of these concepts 
  being able to be described in terms of a definition and instance. 
  So a definition is a standardized description of that concept.
<anthonycamilleri> It's a link to a URI describing the concepts 
  and a type field or framework URI to say where it's coming from.
<anthonycamilleri> So a badge class would be a typical example of 
  a definition for example and then because I felt some models 
  needs things you would also have an instance
<anthonycamilleri> Awesome and an instance would describe but 
  data about the person's individual performance of that concept. 
  So if you're talking about, I don't know, and Bachelor in 
  Sociology. That's where you would put the person's grade or the 
  dates the person that went to that course. And they all the stuff 
  that is unique to the individual.
<anthonycamilleri> And is associated with that concept. If you 
  scroll a little bit more down. I put a very, very basic example 
  in JSON, which you should see there. So here I put
<anthonycamilleri> In line 19 you see schema hasConcept is like I 
  just put hasConcept, so I don't get into the terminology and you 
  see that the definition has an ID.
<anthonycamilleri> And a framework and there would probably be 
  several frameworks accepted globally. And then those are the only 
  two you have
<anthonycamilleri> We could have a whole descriptive, then 
  probably want to include the name and description, but let's say
<anthonycamilleri> What goes below the concept id and framework 
  that's a discussion for another meeting. And then below that. 
  There's the instance of that definition.
<anthonycamilleri> I just invented a couple of fields here and 
  send data performed or grades, but again, let's say what goes 
  into the instance would depend on, let's say, which educational 
  standards, you're using
<anthonycamilleri> So those are, let's say the first high level 
  thoughts I had about this. Again, this is really meant to just be 
  a framework or template for discussion and to get the ball 
  rolling.
<kimhd> Fantastic. I really like this. There are a couple of 
  things I wanted to... Okay, I don't see anyone's	hand raised.
<kimhd> Wwe don't have that many people, so feel free to just 
  interrupt me if I'm missing you, but one thing that I really like 
  about this is this hasConcept definition/instance has. So one 
  thing that I've been struggling with in modeling is the idea of
Kim Hamilton Duffy: The instance of the credential award. So 
  specifically, I'm talking about: I attended a course.
<kimhd> And, you know,  I achieved some credential according to 
  that framework, right. So this let's use this agency facilities 
  management as an example. Then there are things specific to my 
  instance of achieving or acquiring that
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Which like the examples you include here: 
  date performed, grade, but then also might include, you know, 
  back to images. So something representing my attainment of that.
<kimhd> Because the way I've seen a lot of them model. It is the 
  images are being put under credential subject which doesn't seem 
  right. It's not a picture of me the subject. It's a picture of my 
  instance of award of that credentials. So images in here would be 
  like a static, you know, something that every recipient of that 
  credential of agency facilities management would get. Images here 
  could have like my name embedded in it or whatever those specific 
  to me. And so this is the first example I've seen that kind of 
  tease that apart, independent of what we call them right now. I 
  like this a lot.
<kimhd> Let me see if we have a queue right now.
<juan_caballero> I just had a quick question. If
<juan_caballero> Maybe this is just following on the same lines, 
  but I was just wondering is if there's any sense of like	PII goes 
  here or like no PII go through like what the instance. Could it 
  be some record systems for for student credentials would have, 
  like, I don't know, a student identifier in there or
<juan_caballero> Just wondering about that because Kim was saying 
  the image that might contain PII or
<juan_caballero> something specific to the student would would 
  happen in the instance section is that sort of by design.
<kimhd> That was just an example of how you could use instance in 
  the API question. Is it big and it will be going on, we need to. 
  So I'm thinking that for this job spec, a more complete survey of 
  that may be out of scope but with that.
<kimhd> We definitely need to include in the privacy, security 
  concerns what's happening there. But I do think we need you know 
  basically like the concerns like you don't want to put it on a 
  blockchain or things like that. But we do need to
<kimhd> I mean, that's a general problem with verifiable 
  credentials. But I think that it would be useful for us to push 
  forward on that specifically in the context of education. I'm 
  curious, maybe I could ask
<kimhd> Well, actually, I'll get to Phil first and then I was 
  curious to ask and Anthony if what's happening in EDCI, for 
  example, Phil your up first.
<phil-t3> Thanks, Kim. I'm trying to get my head around the, the 
  level of the conversation here because it sounds much to me at 
  least, like what Anthony suggesting has many of the elements that 
  are in, for example, the the data model for badges, an assessment 
  pointer to the method by which a particular achievement or or 
  capability was determined
<phil-t3> Or evidence of that determination in terms of an array 
  of things that a person might have done that they can be pointed 
  to, so I'm just trying to understand how what we're talking about 
  here differs from the description of other data models that have 
  been put forward for carrying a credential.
<kimhd> I can talk to that quickly and then I'll work through the 
  queue.
<kimhd> Which is that I think what we're talking about here is 
  the more generalized notions. So I think that, you know, there 
  are other say other non Open Badges type schemas. This one 
  specifically we're trying to avoid use of certain terms. We're 
  just talking about the concept of it and then those can be mapped 
  to these other frameworks, but there's a mapping work in T3
<kimhd> In you know this credential credential here means 
  credential there, this field here means that field there, I think 
  what we're talking about is slightly higher level than that we're 
  talking about, you know, what are the the concepts we want to 
  express, and what are the general categories we want for it. So 
  like this idea of, the definition versus the instance	and then I 
  don't think it will necessarily be saying like things have to 
  comply with this structure like this isn't prescriptive for Open 
  Badges to say adopt the structure is useful for understanding how 
  what they have in Open Badges map to this. That's my personal 
  take on it
<kimhd> Add yourself to the queue if you have more. If you have 
  additions carry your up
<kerri_lemoie> Actually I don't have much more than Phil because 
  I was thinking the same thing that we're talking about someone 
  like an individual's assertion.
<kerri_lemoie> And the corollary it Open Badges with like, you 
  know, a baked badge, the badge image. What could have something 
  that is personal and unique, whereas the badge image overall is 
  something that you know all the recipients references. So, um, 
  and also, I guess I should say that in the out of scope.
<kerri_lemoie> Issue that you had up earlier because I was a bit 
  late. Sorry, I am I added something about evidence and 
  documentation. So I don't know, maybe if that fits in here in 
  terms of like providing evidence of some kind.
<kerri_lemoie> Of proof, visual, or audio or some kind of media 
  reference or something like that. I was I'm probably too specific 
  at the stage so
<kimhd> Oh no, that's interesting. So for evidence are you seeing 
  that would be out of scope.
<kerri_lemoie> Well, I put it in the out of scope document ask 
  that question to see if it is out of school. I wasn't sure if it 
  come up yet, but it's a pretty critical aspect of matches that I 
  think has been under utilized that could be more utilized
<kimhd> Yeah, that's a good point. Putting it in the issue is a 
  good start. I'd like to continue iterating on that I
<kimhd> Think. Yeah. Actually, we'll come back to that. I was 
  going to offer some opinions on that but I
<kimhd> Yeah, we'll come back to that. Let me see what else I 
  might be missing data ecosystem schema mapper is that the term 
  that I was looking for earlier?
<phil-t3> Basically yes, that's the link that you were talking 
  about the T3 that use you pick a spine as a reference. And then 
  you map directly to the elements of other representations
Kim Hamilton Duffy: So, back to the PR. Where we are: so concepts 
  requiring definition. So Anthony to get back to the PR, I think.
<kimhd> So this is in sort of the intro section where we're 
  talking about what is the scope of this documen, and then we have 
  this concept example.
<kimhd> Now, Anthony, can I ask you to comment on how you see the 
  this informing the rest of the document so
<kimhd> My read again is this is talking about conceptually the 
  generalized structure. And then this specific examples we give 
  you know may not necessarily comply with this, but this is a good 
  generalized structure for things like where we're bridging the 
  frameworks, like something defined in credential engine would be 
  a really good example of that.
<kimhd> That's Not trying to describe the instance; it's 
  describing more what's in this definition part
<kimhd> So, yes. Any other comments on, you know, sort of context 
  and purpose of these additions.
<anthonycamilleri> Maybe I will answer to as well here. So we're 
  clearly not trying to build a empire edu standard here.
<anthonycamilleri> Let's say, for example, 4 concepts was an 
  attempt to say are these the concepts that can map across all the 
  various educational standards. If an open badge could fit into a 
  verifiable credential, the EUROPASS would fit and the credential 
  engine would fit and that would at least be like a small base of 
  concepts that can be carried over between them, and that was also 
  the reason I put in definition and instance, is because if you 
  look at the European ones are in particular EMREX and Europass 
  this instance is a big deal mainly because they were built for 
  formal education and by the way, the instance terminologies also 
  stolen from there, but I'm not wedded to it in any way.
<anthonycamilleri> But moving forward from here. The idea would 
  be I think that first we would find the names for these concepts 
  which we can agree on. And I'm very afraid of that process. 
  Actually, I'm
<anthonycamilleri> But then, secondly, we would need to, I think, 
  agree, what is the minimum amount of data each concept should 
  contain, which I think is the trickier one -- a name, we can all 
  agree on beyond the name, it starts getting more complex. And I 
  think we need to discuss
<anthonycamilleri> In terms of what goes into the instance, I 
  don't think we need to define anything at this stage that goes 
  into an instance
<anthonycamilleri> I think it would be lets say up to the 
  framework to define what goes in the instance. There are a couple 
  of things you might say, we would consider standardizing you 
  could consider putting the grades there, you could consider 
  putting an evidence there.
<anthonycamilleri> But let's say for both of those are. I have a 
  question mark in my own head, whether let's say something we 
  should deal with here or if that should let say belong somewhere 
  else in terms of standardizing and originating
<anthonycamilleri> So those are my thoughts are so far. And to be 
  honest, further thoughts will come. Basically what people say 
  this cool
<kimhd> Great Phil Barker, you're up.
<philbarker> I'm looking at this and I'm trying to get my head 
  around whether it fits with the current things that are already 
  in schema.org
<philbarker> And hasConcept I'm finding a bit confusing. And I'm 
  wondering if there isn't some way of using the existing 
  hasCredential. Measuring the sort of thing that's already in 
  schema.org between a course and a courseinstance to have a 
  credential and a credential instance and that perhaps skipping 
  the definition thing because it, you know, it seems to me that 
  the definition is what you already have for the range of 
  hasCedential, which would be a credential described in JSON LD.
<philbarker> Which sounds a bit rambling. I just wanted to say 
  that if this seems confusing to me, given the background of 
  what's already in schema.org
<kimhd> I'll comment Anthony, but my impression is not that it's 
  meant to replace that. I think this is just a kind of meta, meta 
  model. I think right so hasConcept...
<kimhd> He intentionally doesn't want to put word specific words 
  in there, right, because there's discussion about like 
  hasAchieved versus hasPerformed vs hasCredential. And I think 
  that we're, we're all aligned that hasCredential is it's good 
  that it's there, we can reuse that
<kimhd> But the idea of what are we trying to describe in general 
  before mapping to some specific things. So Anthony, can I	call on 
  you to talk more about that.
<anthonycamilleri> Though I think you covered it, the issue with 
  hasCredential is, I don't know if hasCredential would apply 
  equally to have four concepts I describe above
<anthonycamilleri> If so, then you might use hasCredential and 
  make those types or those could be four different high level 
  concepts. So this isn't something I am clear on myself, either at 
  this point.
<philbarker> Okay, that's fine. That's fine. I was just getting a 
  bit confused with the sort of the point where the way wording 
  goes from this vague hasCredentials to the very specific example 
  underneath that. But okay, I understand that the context. You've 
  just explained
<kimhd> So one actually. Other thing related to this is that we 
  probably need to get editors so, my	comments on editors versus 
  authors. So my understanding is for editors.
<kimhd> That's more, the people that are editors are also 
  authors, but then they're also taking responsibility for doing 
  PRS and accepting commits to the spec and then also just sort of 
  they are more owning the general direction of the spec.
<kimhd> And then authors. I think that there's some heuristics 
  that are used for that. But typically, I think.
<kimhd> You know, it's something that self identified; if this 
  spec is something you want to contribute to you see yourself 
  making
<kimhd> commits in the future, then we can add you as an author, 
  and I think that there are few people that I've identified as, 
  you know, sort of contributing to this already. And feel free to 
  can can people just reach out to me directly. If you're 
  interested in being an editor versus author, and what I'll do is 
  get an initial set of names on the spec itself, because I think 
  we do need to have some initial set of editors to approve PRs 
  just so it's not rubber stamping this, but I think that my 
  proposal would be that we accept this. And I do think possibly by 
  the way I'm showing it on my screen like it's hard to keep the 
  context like Phil was talking about, for example, like we don't 
  want people to read this and think that we're proposing.
<kimhd> That people write credentials, like with this hasConcept 
  term, we want to make clear that
<kimhd> The framing of what we're talking about here, but I think 
  that's more editorial versus this content, which I think we now 
  understand the context for, so
<kimhd> I would like to propose that we merge it with those 
  clarifications, if needed, but then also we should have editors 
  and authors (and reach out to me if you're interested in that.)
<kimhd> We have some discussion about K-12 assertions, Marty. Do 
  you want to talk to that?
<marty_reed> Yeah, so we've been we've been working on kind of 
  the CLR JSON model and I was just wondering, were capable of 
  assertions like GPA or even a know base64 encoded version of the 
  transcripts might fall in these in these concepts, because those 
  assertions seem to overlap these concepts. And so I was just kind 
  of wondering if there was a specific one that that you thought 
  about or is that separate
<kimhd> It Anthony, you mentioned concept three. Do you have 
  anything to add to that?
<anthonycamilleri> Yes. So certainly are anything that's the 
  result of some kind of assessment, generally we consider as 
  concepts free for the moment. 
<anthonycamilleri> Now, if the transcript makes references to 
  learning outcomes achieved as well. You might say concept three 
  with references to concept 2. But basically concept three is 
  meant to be any type of diploma, transcript, or any other typical 
  paper formal education institution.
<marty_reed> So for me the language there is just a little 
  confusing when you say formal assessment process because that I 
  guess it could be considered a course is andassessment of skills, 
  but just some way to clarify that language a little bit would be 
  helpful.
<marty_reed> A formal education process or I don't know how what 
  the right terminology is but, the term assessment from a k-12 
  perspective is very specific ersus you know, a course, per se.
<marty_reed> Are we getting too granular here?
<kimhd> No, no, that's good. There's two. So there's two paths to 
  what I'm thinking right now. One is that so, so I think this 
  framing of like what concepts we're trying to address is 
  critical. I think then, within that, we're going to call out 
  there's a few specific examples that we want to demonstrate. 
<kimhd> We haven't yet locked down what those examples are. And 
  so I think, you know, for example, if you want to propose this 
  k-12 example, that might be a good one, especially if that's 
  something that's happening in LER pilots.
<kimhd> So there's there's one thing that we might actually take 
  a stab at mapping that out in the context of this document, but 
  at the same time, I think for, further refinement of that 
  language. I'd like to land this PR and then keep iterating on 
  that. So, for example,	we could either open issues or PRs and 
  come back to it in and other discussions.
<kimhd> I don't know if there's an easy change to that. But I 
  think that we have some people here who could help refine that 
  language. So I'd recommend opening an issue in on the VC-Ed 
  models repo to sort of clarify how k-12 terminology fits in.
<marty_reed> Makes sense. Thank you.
<kimhd> Joshua was that I don't know if that was a comment. I'm 
  not sure struck means
<kimhd> Phil
<phil-t3> I think what I what I think he's trying to do is is I 
  described in the chat is lay out a sort of a superstructure for 
  this conversation, within which more detailed things need to fit 
  or for which, if they don't, the superstructure needs to be 
  questioned and the one thing that I didn't notice in here is that 
  Non formal or informal learning activities.
<phil-t3> I'm not sure quite fit in the superstructure at this 
  stage.
<phil-t3> Because they can be every bit as
<phil-t3> As evidence based as
<phil-t3> A structured thing they're just not presented in the 
  context of the learning outcome intended there. They're often 
  occurring in work and various other learning focus structured 
  activity.
Joshua Marks: Yeah, and that's what I was about to elaborate on 
  what Marty was saying there's a set of things that I wouldn't 
  call our achievements, but our summary outcomes such as GPA.  
  We're dealing with two or three different kinds of GPA: core GPA, 
  total GPA, and sectional GPA kind of components of a transcript 
  and those are not individually achievements, but the summaries of 
  a bunch of achievements, I might argue that the credential itself 
  is also a summary of a bunch of achievements.
<joshua_marks> And then in addition, there's a bunch of 
  information that occurs in the transcript that describes the 
  context of the achievement, but not an achievement in and of 
  itself.
<joshua_marks> You know, like, what term in which the achievement 
  was achieved or the time period that the credential was awarded, 
  etc. So there's many things that I don't think fall into these 
  concept buckets that are important to something like a 
  transcript.
<joshua_marks> And have been formalized in many transcript 
  structures. And I think what Phil was saying also goes along with 
  that, there's many things in job context that are contextual or 
  summary that don't fall into these buckets.
<kimhd> Anthony. You're on the queue.
<anthonycamilleri> Okay. Ah, so what you're referring to Joshua.
<anthonycamilleri> I fully agree, and I understand.
<anthonycamilleri> I mean, I think this is something we could get 
  in terms what Phil was saying I could, I asked you for a little 
  more explanation in the sense that for me.
<anthonycamilleri> In terms of an example because for me this is 
  what concept one was for, to describe informal learning where you 
  say, I just did something. It wasn't part of an educational 
  program or so on. Here's something I did. Here's my work 
  experience. It's just something I did.
<anthonycamilleri> Or you could use conception to say I have this 
  skill, I'm not telling you anything about this program, etc. So 
  I'm not quite understanding what's missing is something is 
  absolutely no issue, but I need a couple of examples to get where 
  you're coming from.
<kimhd> Yes, Phil.
<phil-t3> Thanks, Anthony. I think the main crux of what Joshua 
  was alluding to this is that the context. I think seems to 
  matter. One might, for example, in the context of working on an 
  accounting system in a job become facile with particular methods 
  of calculation with that involve statistical calculations of one 
  sort or another and learning it that way, as opposed to being in 
  a course in accounting that specifically intended to build a 
  structure for you to learn those sorts of things to me at least 
  implies a different a different set of experiences that, on the 
  one hand, both lead to the ability to do a particular thing.
<phil-t3> But the non-structured approach conveys that that was 
  done because the person brought to it's something that they were 
  able to leverage to achieve that outcome as opposed to having 
  that constructed in an intentional way for them to be able to 
  build on.
<phil-t3> Don't know if that helps you
<anthonycamilleri> I know that sounds completely on what I would 
  suggest is, either  you or I could do it, I would suggest that we 
  open an issue for the GPA example and for this exam I will keep 
  the other use case. So, and then, basically we can give it a shot 
  and trying to break it down
<kimhd> Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you for clarifying that.
<kimhd> Okay I think PII might be too meaty to get into now.
<kimhd> We might have that as a separate discussion with maybe 
  with a little more preparation. Anyone have anything else to add, 
  we might be able to end a little bit early. If not,
<kimhd> Phil Barker?
<philbarker> Yeah. Could you scroll down a wee bit on the screen, 
  please.  So it's part of what I covered in my last ramble
<philbarker> I think what I'd like to see in this and what, you 
  know, if you like, I can you know if this is accepted as a public 
  rest, I can build on that is that the the schema hasConcept 
  shouldn't go to something that's got a definition, it should go 
  straight to the definition of the thing.
<philbarker> And the instance should be an instance of a thing. 
  So if you have schema hasCredential.
<philbarker> Then what you have underneath that is the idea of 
  the credential and type credential, which is already a typing 
  schema and then
<philbarker> Consider adding to the credential class in 
  schema.org a hasInstance property which goes to what's listed 
  here as a separate property instance, because what I'm not seeing 
  here you know types. I'm not seeing domains that match what's in 
  schema.org at the moment.
<philbarker> I can imagine a hasCompleted that goes to a course 
  and then you can use the existing course instance to point to the 
  particular instance of the course.
<philbarker> So I don't think I want to try and explain that any 
  further in words, but if this is accepted as a pull request. I 
  can try editing it to show more clearly what I mean
<kimhd> One thing I'm wondering is, maybe having the schema 
  prefix is sending our heads in the wrong direction, because I 
  think I'm seeing this, not necessarily as something that someone 
  would express directly. So Phil B I definitely hear what you're 
  saying. Like in terms of how schema org works.
<kimhd> You would have some of this in the type; I think that 
  this is just calling out a meta structure again and and i think 
  one way we might do that is just expressing it more like in 
  pseudo code, rather than in JSON; just making it clear, like this 
  is this is not a thing that we're recommending you go off and do 
  this is the, these are the high level elements.
<kimhd> Then, in terms of how it how it's actually implemented, I 
  think, is what I'd really like to get that from you because I 
  think how that maps to schema.org --  what's in there right now. 
  That would be very useful.
<kimhd> But I could take a stab at that, if if Anthony is all 
  right. Obviously I'll submitt as a PR. But Anthony What do you 
  think about that, like if I sort of rework it into kind of more 
  pseudo code kind of
<kimhd> Less weight then JSON-LD. And then maybe the 
  interpretations people are taking with it.
<anthonycamilleri> No problem from my side, anything that makes 
  it clear, and let's have some fun debating.
<kimhd> Any other comments before we end the call.
<kimhd> So I want to thank everyone. This was extremely useful 
  for sort of start working through some of the issues we're going 
  to continue having these working sessions and, you know, focusing 
  on this and any related efforts. learner wallet discussions might 
  come up more in the coming weeks as a separate issue, but it 
  would be nice to get this thing closer to landed and finished off 
  or at least at a stable point where we can continue iterating in 
  the background.
<kimhd> So Phil reiterate next steps. Good idea.
<kimhd> We have a lot of them. First we need editors and authors 
  and they don't have to be the final set but I'd appreciate if 
  people could reach out to me directly. If you're interested in 
  being an editor or author just email me.
<kimhd> And so we need, we need some names on the spec. The 
  editors are the people who should review the PRs as they come in. 
  And so this will be a good forcing function.
<kimhd> Let's see. Okay, so then we get editors, we merge this, 
  and then we start reworking into some, something that captures 
  this discussion. So, for example,
<kimhd> It seemed like the framing of it, you know, describing as 
  JSON-LD versus something more pseudo code type of thing was maybe 
  confusing people. So I'll take a stab at that. There were a few 
  other things that came up
<kimhd> For example, Joshua Marks had a good term for it. Summary 
  outcome or something, he was using GPA as an example.
<kimhd> Were in our concepts we didn't quite have a category for 
  that yet. So I think that I would appreciate it if we could get 
  filled long in Joshua marks to hopefully add some details there. 
  So we'll probably need to do that in a in a tracking issues. So I 
  can send that out.
<kimhd> Oh, thank you, Phil, you're writing them to me. So the 
  the other one would be creating an issue around  summary 
  outcomes, perhaps
<joshua_marks> Yeah. Summary outcomes and outcomes context.
<joshua_marks> So the two buckets or the outcome context is gonna 
  be tricky because it occurs at all levels of the hierarchy.
<kimhd> Great.
<kimhd> And then there was one other thing that I just 
  remembering from way further back in the discussion is Phil Long 
  mentioned around recommendations about use of DIDs.
<kimhd> There's several layers to it. But I do think that it will 
  be useful for this document to have something around at least a 
  descriptive definition of how DIDs can be used.
<kimhd> Because I think I'll be able to provide that
<kimhd> Any more thorough examination of which did are useful for 
  which kind of context would be out of scope, but I think we could 
  bring something like that in scope. So that's the last thing that 
  we had privacy. PII will will definitely come up again. So I 
  don't, I don't know if there's an issue we need to create right 
  now. But we'll, we'll come back to that.
<kimhd> Great. Thank you so much, Phil. Saved me some time.
<phil-t3> Trying to help
<kimhd> Okay, thank you, everyone.
