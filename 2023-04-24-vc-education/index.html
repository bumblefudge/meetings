<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="information">Brooke_Lipsitz: Fostering movement and reducing friction is that you know there&apos;s this firm belief that this is a lifelong journey and the more we can do to remove barriers and in the Learner Journey the better it is for obviously the learner as well as the institution and facilitating this movement it&apos;s not just a transcript for you that can hold students back but even leans. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="information">Brooke_Lipsitz: Jin the tln right now and seeing a learner coming to use the service we expect it to be very simple so this is a place that more often than not you&apos;ll probably be guided to you by another application that needs verification of your records and the idea would be a learner would be coming to the talent to be able to access credentials from multiple institutions in one single place in this particular view I have two institutions. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
