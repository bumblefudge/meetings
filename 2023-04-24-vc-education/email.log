<kerri_lemoie> Hello all - we'll get started in a couple of 
  minutes
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Kerri Lemoie:  Hey welcome to the Monday April 24th verifiable 
  verify the credentials for Education task force today I would 
  like to welcome Brooke Brooke I'm sorry I'm and then we actually 
  said your last name I'm sorry Brooke lipsitz I saying that 
  correctly brick is a here from ASU the learning that and trusted 
  Learning Network so she's going to tell us about the work that 
  they've been doing.
Kerri Lemoie:   Doing there.

Topic: IP Note

Kerri Lemoie:  Let me first so go through our proposed agenda and 
  then we will get going let brick take it from there so our first 
  thing is about IP notes if you've been on these calls before you 
  have a you've heard this.
Kerri Lemoie:  So any any contributions to the specifications at 
  w3c require membership and full IP our agreements to be signed 
  this is open Community College so it's not required to attend 
  these calls but if you intend to do some some more work that is 
  something that you should look into secondly for call notes Here 
  in the chat.

Topic: Call Notes

Kerri Lemoie:  So all of the minutes for these calls and audio 
  recording and actually also a video recording of anybody 
  requested are all take place for this whole call and so note that 
  we do that so that those who can't attend the call even those who 
  are here and want to reference it later I'm have it available to 
  them in a public setting.
Kerri Lemoie:  So we used it see here on the left for our chat I 
  think some folks might use IRC but primarily we used to see here 
  and we use a cue system to to have conversations so if you like 
  to kill yourself you can either hit the hand signal and the 
  bottom low or hand dashboard of Duty or you could type key + to 
  raise your hand or q- treasure hand just like I did in the chap.
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay what do we start with introductions and 
  reintroductions.
Kerri Lemoie:  Since you are new today could I ask you to 
  introduce yourself.

Topic: Introductions & Reintroductions

Brooke_Lipsitz: Absolutely I'm Brooke lipsitz I'm the product 
  manager of the trusted learner network with ASU Enterprise 
  technology I work closely with Kate you have a Keeney who I'm 
  sure you've seen before in this space and also partner with 
  third-party developers and some of the people that are on the 
  call and our architecture and advisory committee so we have a lot 
  of collaboration in the space.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  and without the help of.
<stuartf> IRC and matrix.org chat are bridged into the Jitsi chat
Brooke_Lipsitz: Keep people in their insights we probably would 
  not be at the stage of development were currently at and happy to 
  be here and show you the work that we've done over the last 10 
  months or so.
Kerri Lemoie:  Awesome thank you brick anybody else that's new to 
  the call today or somebody who like to reintroduce themselves 
  before we get going.
Kerri Lemoie:  When you see a cube minus in the chat that is the 
  checking to see if anybody is it like you.
Kerri Lemoie: Topics: Announcements & Reminders
Kerri Lemoie:  Does anybody have any announcements or reminders 
  that I'd like to tell the community about if so you can give 
  yourselves up right now to do that.
<kerri_lemoie> Upcoming CCG Meetings & Events: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/announcements/
<brooke_lipsitz> 2023 TLN Unconference is 5/18! We'd love to have 
  all of you join us in Phoenix!
Kerri Lemoie:  Hey I also do not have any announcements or 
  reminders although I could post this link here in case you want 
  to know what is going on at the ccg this is where announcements 
  are typically made and also in the mailing list this week was 
  outside last week was the internet identity workshop and I 
  suspect we'll start hearing some more about what happened there 
  I'm excited to learn about that.
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay then with that why don't we start with our 
  main topic and brick thank you for being here again today I love 
  you I have the pleasure of working with brick and others on this 
  call on the architecture advisory committee and I really have a 
  soft spot in my heart for this project I think they're doing some 
  really great interesting work and thinking about verifiable 
  credentials in a very different way from a network approach and I 
  think I you'll find her what.
Kerri Lemoie:   They're doing really interesting brick once you 
  take it from here.
Kerri Lemoie:  We can when you're done we can see if there any 
  questions how about that.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Okay great let me just figure out that I want to 
  make sure I can share my screen.

Topic: Main Topic: Brooke Lipitz from ASU Trusted Learner Network (TLN)

Brooke_Lipsitz: Can everyone see my screen.
Brooke_Lipsitz: So I'm going to be running you through our lean 
  tln interface I'm trying to do less and less slides the more I 
  present just because I noticed there tends to be a difference so 
  I figure I might as well just jump straight in so we've just 
  rounded out our phase one development for the tln so less than a 
  year ago we didn't have even the architecture in place.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  and that was something that we worked with our.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Visors during our 2022 tln on conference on some 
  of the people on the call were actually a part of that meeting so 
  shout out to Stuart and Roger Davies as well so we've really come 
  a long way considering we had essentially nothing in place to 
  then having a blueprint developing an alpha Tech stack 
  establishing governance you.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Events like plugfest to to help guide some of our 
  early design decisions and considerations and now we're at this 
  place to where we're also having another development company help 
  us can take into consideration institutional few and development 
  the what I'm going to show you today is the learner view of the 
  tln or and again this is still early development so I'm sure much 
  of this might change over time.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  I'm but just.
Brooke_Lipsitz: So the Crux of what we're doing essentially but 
  all of this even though we're using certain Technologies and 
  semantic standards all this is really about simplifying access to 
  namely course credentials degree credentials that Learners have 
  learned throughout their career our angle into this with regard 
  to credit Mobility.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Fostering movement and reducing friction is that 
  you know there's this firm belief that this is a lifelong journey 
  and the more we can do to remove barriers and in the Learner 
  Journey the better it is for obviously the learner as well as the 
  institution and facilitating this movement it's not just a 
  transcript for you that can hold students back but even leans.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  she added with an account so we've.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Trying to Envision other ways to essentially give 
  Learners access to the records that they've learned ideally from 
  a single source to be able to share out and again he's that 
  movement regardless of what their status is at a university 
  financially so to speak verifiable credentials are one way of 
  working around that in the space so that's a big part of why 
  we've been talking with out with all of you throughout.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  out four different considerations.
Brooke_Lipsitz: So where we're at today is we have a lien UI and 
  a back end for this and for calls in particular to be made to the 
  tln so we've just envisioned what it would look like for a 
  learner to manage their credentials and actually based on some of 
  what we've experienced there's still some design considerations 
  that we are taking into consideration for the beginning stages of 
  this because when we initially set this up it was designed to 
  work.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  work with a wallet so you'd come and bring your 
  own wallet and that.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Be utilizing for identification purposes however 
  that's proven to have certain barriers in and of itself and so 
  what are you discussing is ways to make that easier assuming that 
  you know having to come with another Identity or another set of 
  credentials might be a barrier for a portion of the Learners that 
  would be using this platform so again there there's always 
  something in progress that we have to consider or pivot to make a 
  change for.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Jin the tln right now and seeing a learner coming 
  to use the service we expect it to be very simple so this is a 
  place that more often than not you'll probably be guided to you 
  by another application that needs verification of your records 
  and the idea would be a learner would be coming to the talent to 
  be able to access credentials from multiple institutions in one 
  single place in this particular view I have two institutions.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  I have ASU and also namely.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Beta Community College where I've earned 
  credentials in the particular use case example that I give I 
  talked about how I might want to take an internship in DC and so 
  there's relevant coursework that they need to see in order to 
  ensure that I've met their eligibility criteria namely that I've 
  earned an associate's degree and then I have some relevant 
  history classes to prove that I'm on that track for example so 
  selecting.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  credentials in the TL.
Brooke_Lipsitz: I don't have to share everything I have the 
  option to bundle my credentials for sharing or expert them 
  directly to a wallet so if I created a bundle specifically for DC 
  internship.
Brooke_Lipsitz: I can do just that and again it gives me the 
  ability to change how I share or who I share with or I can even 
  just delete the bundle that I have in place so if in this case I 
  want to add gamma Tech University to institutions that I'm 
  sharing this with I can do that as well.
Brooke_Lipsitz: The inferior the ideal would be to have multiple 
  institutions participating in the tln already available to the 
  learner to help make this process easier but that is something 
  that we're brainstorming and figuring out how best to draw in 
  various institutions for this purpose so that's a big part of 
  this as well to Learners would have the ability to change their.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  consent at any.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Again this is very learner Centric learner first 
  that we're designing and developing for and we also have a 
  companying services that we plan for constituents of the tln to 
  work with namely another credit Mobility tool that we have in 
  place which is interactive degree planner that's currently in 
  development right now but the idea is that a learner could share 
  credentials that they've earned to.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  institutions to help them plan.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Future directory with regards to earning a 
  degree.
Brooke_Lipsitz: This is all still early stages so to speak and 
  that's the bulk of what I have to show off from a demo 
  perspective we have Hi-Fi mock-ups that we're working on for our 
  institutional development but that is that development likely 
  won't be ready until middle of June to be able to show off so 
  we're really excited about that.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  that as well.
Brooke_Lipsitz: The yeah the the demo itself of the Chillin is 
  fairly simplistic Roger Stewart if there's anything that you 
  would like to add based on the work you've done on the a AC to 
  speak to some of this by all means.
<phil_l_(p1)> What does 'bundling' mean vs. export to a wallet?  
  The latter seems self-explanatory pushing credentials to a wallet 
  for sending from there, I assume.
<kerri_lemoie> Stuart speaking
Stuart Freeman:  Sure I think this is a really interesting and 
  cool project and obviously has a lot of.
Stuart Freeman:  Good cutting from it with the the ability for 
  the user to sort of be self Sovereign I think the challenge that 
  we're going to face is you know adoption getting people at the 
  institutions to understand.
Stuart Freeman:  Now this is actually still you know private 
  until the user opens things up.
Stuart Freeman:  And just yeah the the ability to.
Stuart Freeman:  Run their own infrastructure versus having a 
  contract from want to do it and how we get everyone interoperable 
  I think that's the.
Stuart Freeman:  Going forward at this point.
<roger_davies> Phil, the bundling allows for curation inside the 
  TLN without having to pull and mediate through a wallet (when all 
  participants are members).
<kerri_lemoie> Will call on you next, @nate
Brooke_Lipsitz: And Phil I saw your question about bundling 
  bundling is another way of grouping credential so having the 
  ability to pick and choose and then create a bundle oh you know 
  or if in the case you're not using a wallet to be able to export 
  that grouping of credentials in this space so essentially 
  bundling could be thought of as creating unique.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  comprehensive learner records that.
Brooke_Lipsitz: It was a collection of records that you're 
  sharing in a cluster so to speak I don't know if that helps.
<phil_l_(p1)> As a VP or ?
Brooke_Lipsitz: Explain the usage of the bundling feature not but 
  also open to any feedback on that as well too.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Is the VC is that what you're asking Phil.
<nate_otto_(he/him)> So is the bundle a ClrCredential compliant 
  with CLR 2.0?
Phil_L_(P1): No as a verifiable presentation as opposed to a VC.
Brooke_Lipsitz: That's a great question.
Kerri Lemoie:  I don't think that's been figured out yet.
Phil_L_(P1): So is the intention that this will be a bundle that 
  is sent via email from the platform or it's just not clear yet.
Brooke_Lipsitz: That yeah that's not clear yet either how do we 
  how do we send this to a third party if not through a wallet so 
  that's something we still need to consider as well too.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> the way it looked to me, the 
  bundle is just a convenience inside the platform
Brooke_Lipsitz: We know we can issue is VCS we have that capacity 
  but again it is a good question as far as how are we exporting 
  this and to into where if it's outside of the TL on.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm going to call Arnie made out of who has a 
  question about about the universities that are participating Nate 
  you have the floor.
<phil_l_(p1)> @Deb that's what I inferred by wanted more clarity
Nate_Otto_(he/him): Thanks looks exciting to see this application 
  coming here I had a question about the sharing two institutions 
  screen that you briefly showed wondering how the institutions get 
  placed into that list of options that someone could share to and 
  then what actually happens when you select to share to a 
  particular Institution.
Brooke_Lipsitz: So ideally these are institutions that want to be 
  a part of the tln they've been vetted we've determined that they 
  met some degree of issuance quality there's been some Wedding by 
  the governing body so this is still in Pilot as well too is 
  figuring out what that process looks like as far as options for 
  sharing learner would be able to just grant TL.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  then access in.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Any institution on the teal on could have access 
  to their credentials also change specifically to have select 
  institutions access their credentials like maybe if I am only 
  interested in sharing between Arizona State and beta Community 
  College and the gamma Tech is opposed to UT Austin and Georgia 
  Tech I want to want to manage those permissions differently or 
  being able to set them so we're their private.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  to me then it's not discoverable to any.
Brooke_Lipsitz: In the tln except for the issuing institution I 
  should say so the by default if an institution is issued credits 
  to then they do have access to the credentials they've issued to 
  you but they wouldn't be able to see other credentials on the 
  network associated with you without your there your explicit 
  permission.
Nate_Otto_(he/him): So it sounds like it's a different user who 
  is authenticated to the same domain who then gets to see the 
  thing is there any transfer of data from one instance of an 
  application to outside of the application to another one that was 
  part of this sharing.
Brooke_Lipsitz: There could be through my services and so and 
  just the key would be notifying the learner that when you're when 
  you start to share outside of the tln that access could be 
  persistent so just being mindful of that even with interactive 
  degree planner for example you know once you're sharing outside 
  of the network.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Bearing in mind there's less control over what 
  you share it because again each application you share with is 
  going to have their own terms of services on how they utilize 
  their data so I think the key for us is just making sure that 
  we're very clear on to the learner or the end-user how their data 
  could be used if we have a designated third-party application and 
  place that they could share out too.
Nate_Otto_(he/him): Cool thanks for the info just since I have to 
  have the mic one more follow-up do you have any like API 
  documentation or a description of what this connection to these 
  other services entails.
Brooke_Lipsitz: That's a great question I could follow up with my 
  developer I don't I don't know that they have any explicit 
  documentation but that's something that we should probably be 
  making available shortly for people to reference especially if we 
  plan to utilize other applications in the future it's something 
  that we definitely need to have in place if we don't currently 
  but I'll check with my developer to see if we have anything on 
  our GitHub for example.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you Nick my hash from pocket Krabs you have 
  the floor.
Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: Thank you very nice to see right 
  here I'm an alumnus of ASU so I'm excited someday too maybe even 
  retrieve my 30-year old records through this method so true it is 
  wonderful just had a couple of questions first one is I presume 
  this is conformant to open badges 3.0 is that a correct 
  statement.
Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com:  in terms of standards as.
Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: All verifiable credential 
  standards that you use.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Yes well for plugfest to we had to aligned the 
  open badge standard but that is something that we want to commit 
  to as well as to maintaining that data is still a big part of 
  this so we're figuring out is how data is ingested and also 
  shared because not just open badge but we also want to be able to 
  export into other formats as well too and so that's a big.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  big part of this but yes opened by open badge.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Those formats that we plan to have criteria 
  shared in that format.
Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: So far another question kind of 
  related is how do you identify the subject today you know so this 
  is kind of like you said and you know it's not like you know the 
  classic example that you see where somebody comes in with their 
  wallet and they can give you a did and so on and so forth so you 
  would have to identify the subject to the or the student here 
  right how do you identify this tool subject within the.
Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com:  the verifiable credential in this 
  in this.
Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: Doing right now.
Brooke_Lipsitz: So it's interesting that you say that because we 
  actually had it set up to do that using a wallet and a did for 
  for the demo example that I have I was using the various wallet 
  specifically however just by using and again this varus is great 
  so it's nothing on the various wallet but the barriers in demoing 
  if they're if something's going wrong with the varus wallet have 
  all indicated that we need to have some other form of.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  identity management for a learner to access.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Because we don't want barriers to accessing your 
  wallet to impact your access to the tln but at the same time 
  there's a difference of opinion on whether or not the teal and 
  should be managing you know their own created accounts for 
  example or something those along those lines so that's something 
  we still have to reconcile so as of this point you can use a did 
  from a wallet to connect and then beyond that like when I 
  validate different.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  tutions are ASU it's it's built into.
Brooke_Lipsitz: So so if I if I were to reset this and wanted to 
  connect to Arizona State University and actually prompts me to 
  enter in My ASU credentials because it's connecting and 
  validating that way to be even pull up my Arizona State 
  credentials just really hard to show once it caches that 
  information unfortunately so when connecting the various 
  institutions were hoping to still utilize SSO and oid see but 
  there is something that we still need to reconcile at the out.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  outset which is what is.
Brooke_Lipsitz: The main source for someone connecting to the tln 
  which we haven't fully reconciled but we're leaning to the place 
  of someone needs to have another way to connect Beyond a wallet 
  and if so what would that look like.
<roger_davies> Phil, yes the whole structure is available through 
  signed queries using GraphQL and a couple of other formats 
  (Sparkle, a SQL adjacent query stucture etc).  We haven't 
  formalized the standards yet.  As Brooke indicated we're hoping 
  to support a few output formats transparently (Open Badge 3, CLR 
  2 etc).
Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: Yeah and so that's to connect to 
  tln but what about what's in the verifiable credential itself so 
  if I went in and say downloaded or exported my credential what 
  would it say in the subject field would it give my ASU ID or 
  would it give my email or date of birth or name I was curious how 
  you kind of solve that problem especially in the absence of a 
  wallet right.
Brooke_Lipsitz: That's a great question and I don't think we've 
  gotten that far we did just a minimum viable criteria for 
  plugfest to and Carrie can you speak to this with we're any of 
  those criteria in the VC that we issued or what were the four 
  main criteria to issue is an open badge that we needed.
Kerri Lemoie:  Right forever plexus to we did I had to be no 
  match 3.0 and basically we were just using a decentralised 
  identifiers to for the identity to keep it pretty simple for 
  breakfast too.
Brooke_Lipsitz: So if we connected with a wallet we could have 
  used that decentralized identifier in the VC okay okay.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Yeah that's true.
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah yeah you used a chappie to your connecting 
  service yep.
Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: Super just what sorry I just last 
  thing is there any of this work visible as open source or do you 
  plan to do it at some point in the future.
Brooke_Lipsitz: It's were using all open source standards but 
  yeah I mean ideally at a certain point we would like to have it 
  available especially because we know to a degree degree 
  institutions connecting with the tln are going to need access to 
  relevant materials to do that especially if they're going to have 
  different ways in which they need to manage their data or their 
  networking configurations so as of right now I don't have.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  anything publicly.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Again that's just based on the stage that we're 
  at since we're still in a prototype stage but as we get further 
  along I'm I'm I'm confident that there will be portions of this 
  that will be publicly available to review.
Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: Thank you Brooke and Kay.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you Deb Everhart from Credential Engine has 
  the floor
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Hi thanks I'm great to see this 
  thank you I think you know your point earlier about adoption is 
  always as always a challenge but I think we can support adoption 
  together in terms of the data structure so if the data structure 
  inside the system and also have a data is moving between systems 
  is using CDL think that will bring in different institutions.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  tuitions and even state.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Have a lot of data already in 
  CTL and make it more useful and the just a comment and then a 
  question about the you know like adding up your credits and 
  sharing them with other institutions I assume that those are 
  currently based on existing articulation agreement so I'll let 
  you comment on that but also just point out that CTL also 
  provides a data structure for transfer.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  values so that it.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Not only those that are already 
  known to the system but that could be pulled in from other 
  sources in sitio.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> CTDL transfer value 
  https://credreg.net/ctdl/handbook#transfervalue
Brooke_Lipsitz: Really great feedback and I definitely appreciate 
  that Insight with regard to see TDL interestingly enough this 
  credit calculator feature this was something that our developer 
  generated but it did pose a problem for us and that.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Institutions measure or determine credits 
  differently so this is probably not going to be a feasible 
  service but what he was trying to show off was how you could 
  utilize the simple Lambda function within the tln to do some of 
  the work for you without having to take data outside of the tln 
  meaning like that might be an option at a future date granted 
  from our perspective that's probably not going to.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  see how the tln is going to function.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Primarily because we're not trying to supplant 
  what any other dedicated service could be doing for the learner 
  and especially with more sophistication or taking in 
  consideration articulation agreements being like that's this is 
  not the main purpose of the tln so I appreciate that call out 
  because this this is something that we probably should update 
  because again it's going to be confusing for people who know more 
  in depth about that.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  it what's more applicable is probably this 
  Interactive.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Enter path but again that's really just focusing 
  on sharing your credentials with the service like interactive 
  degree planner so this is really just giving the ability to share 
  with that service that.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Is sophisticated to be able to do that or has 
  those articulation agreements or has a stronger understanding of 
  how FERPA works for example so so if this if this piece threw you 
  off we are aware that this is probably not not going to stay but 
  really good observation and call out for sure.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Well certainly all three of 
  these are our valuable services but also all very complex so 
  anything we can do to help normalize the data infrastructure for 
  that were happy to be engaged to just let us know.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Thank you so much Debbie really appreciate the 
  feedback.
Kerri Lemoie:  Awesome Phil Barker you have the floor.
Brooke_Lipsitz: I think anything that eases the lift is something 
  that we're interested in I know we've talked about pesky at a 
  certain point as well too oh Roger feel free to speak up 
  specifically regarding this I see your hand raised.
Alan Davies:  Yeah so we've actually looked at pesky little bit 
  one of the reasons we've looked at it is because many of the 
  institutional student Information Systems already have some 
  mechanism to support pasch so we thought just like you identified 
  it would be an easy way and easy format for institutions to 
  generate transcript like data into for us to consume that work 
  certainly hasn't been completed that it is one of the things we 
  have.
Alan Davies:   Playing around with a.
Alan Davies:  Aspiration of the goal is to make onboarding 
  institutions and their data as streamlined as possible and we're 
  you know we're pursuing a lot of different Avenues to try to make 
  that easier including some you know AI tricks you know there's 
  more than one attempt being made but pass could certainly one of 
  the things we've looked into largely because a couple of the 
  institutions who are participating very actively.
Alan Davies:  Hurting past credentials.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you feeling Roger Mariana from ASU pocket 
  you have the floor.
Marianna_Milkis,_ASU_Pocket: Hello thank you hi Brooke I just 
  realized that we were you know kind of in parallel on AC 
  Enterprise technology side of things and I was just curious 
  Brooke to hear your thoughts on CLR format as you talk about 
  bundling and that seems to be one of the use cases and I know I 
  get asked that a lot of whether or not as you walk it will 
  support ov3 nclr and I know you already are supporting of e3 so 
  wanted to ask about CLR.
Marianna_Milkis,_ASU_Pocket:  and also about case standards.
<phil_l_(p1)> are you talking about CLRv2?
<marianna_milkis,_asu_pocket> Yes, thanks Phil
Brooke_Lipsitz: Yeah ideally we would support CL are some of the 
  logic was once we need once we can guarantee that we're 
  supporting open badge three that essentially paves the way for us 
  to be compatible with CLR but the trickiest part with the data is 
  even just figuring out the best way to map even our own data just 
  how we utilize it and Raj.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  your Davies can speak more to.
<roger_davies> Yeah, Badge 3, CLR 2
Brooke_Lipsitz: To just the goofy nature in which we package our 
  own data for transcripts has unique so it's not just a matter of 
  using PeopleSoft language or Banner it's you know what 
  anticipating how instapage how institutions are using data 
  themselves as well to like how much of a.
Brooke_Lipsitz: How much heavy lifting are we going to have to do 
  upfront with institutions to be able to.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Ingest their data for example we're hoping that 
  maybe there are some barriers we can break down at the outset but 
  we also want to make sure that institutions can bring their own 
  data and that's not going to be a problem but in and of itself we 
  have our own as I'm sure you can relate to Mariana with data with 
  pocket as well too it's just it's interesting how we.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  are concatenated.
Brooke_Lipsitz: For example and it looks like it's one particular 
  record that we're pulling from but it might be a few different 
  ones for example so I hope that answered the first part of your 
  question then the second I'm sorry that Mariana the second part 
  of your question was.
Marianna_Milkis,_ASU_Pocket: Just around K standards and yeah I 
  mean it answers it's kind of similar to how we feel but I do 
  think that there is a benefit to eventually driving towards just 
  like we're talking about normalizing all the all the data 
  structures kind of driving towards compatibility with that 
  because the registrar's office at the registrar's admin a crowd 
  has approved still ours for kind of a standard for.
Marianna_Milkis,_ASU_Pocket: Sharing College transfer transcripts 
  so it's feels like an incentive to sink in that direction but 
  yeah they had that question was about the case standards.
Brooke_Lipsitz: You know we should probably compare notes about 
  it offline because I'm sure Mariana your team is much more tapped 
  in as far as what Michael Crow is recommending or anticipating I 
  don't I don't know that we've gotten that far to be quite honest 
  so that's something that we definitely should be considering.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Happy to definitely talk with you more offline as 
  well to based on what you've learned up until this point.
Marianna_Milkis,_ASU_Pocket: Sure sounds good yeah and I'm just 
  to be clear I don't know for sure if that is being adopted at ASU 
  at the moment I just know that like Tennessee Board of regions 
  and Alabama and bunch of other places have actually started 
  implementing that so you know could that but yeah let's chat.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Yeah yeah that would be great you know and some 
  of the design some of what we've built into this design is 
  aspirational in and of itself like we're using rdf and we're 
  making some assumptions about rdf framework and its ability to 
  into it and infer that we haven't really been able to test or 
  prove out yet so that will be interesting to see.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  so as we start.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Map to different data schemas and seeing how the 
  system starts to recognize new data for example but it is a again 
  a big guess up until we can get to the point where we're actually 
  testing it but data is a big part of this and something that you 
  know we're still trying to get our head around the actual scope 
  for our next release cycle as far as what our goals with regard 
  to data what is achievable.
Brooke_Lipsitz:  Al and what.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Should we be using to help us with this process.
Marianna_Milkis,_ASU_Pocket: Yeah for sure.
Kerri Lemoie:  Great thank you so long have the floor.
Phil_L_(P1): Thanks I just in listening to the conversation it 
  seems like it's probably useful to take a step back and and think 
  through or at least discuss whether that in the data structures 
  that you're talking about are for the purposes of internal 
  processing and manipulation of the data within the network versus 
  external communication and if it's for external communication 
  whether it's to somebody or.
Phil_L_(P1):  ization that has a secure pipe that you can.
Phil_L_(P1): Can connect to versus someone that may not have that 
  like an individual alumni or or student where the only other 
  mechanism that you have for somebody like that is to provide the 
  security through the API that you're using to talk to them with 
  so a lot of the seems like you could parse this problem up a bit 
  and and then apply the appropriate methods that are optimized for 
  the eat.
Phil_L_(P1):  each of those three sort of use cases.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> for external communication of 
  the meaning of the credentials, include a link in the alignment 
  field to metadata in CTDL in the Registry
Phil_L_(P1): The form of the data for transport can be any number 
  of things even in the VC world and wrapped by a VC as and then 
  transported by a secure protocol like jappy here we see a pi or 
  PID c4d for whatever is the most appropriate for the audience 
  you're talking about whereas point-to-point Communications with 
  other institutions is just a whole other thing which is where 
  past can many of the.
Phil_L_(P1):  organizations of that sort have been focused in the 
  past.
https://credentialengine.org/resources/how-to-align-digital-credentials-with-meaningful-ctdl-data/
Phil_L_(P1): I just think it would be helpful to parse this a 
  little bit and then think about the subsets of in approaches to 
  those that might be useful to you in those contexts thanks.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Phil thank you so much that's very well put in in 
  thoughtful and definitely something that we need to take into 
  consideration so I really appreciate your feedback on that thank 
  you.
Kerri Lemoie:  I thank you that you have before.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Yeah so thanks Phil that's a 
  great tee up and just you know one practical use of the data is 
  is for the metadata that can be shared and to have that bnct DL 
  so I think a really practical use case would be that when these 
  credentials are going to be issued to people for use in a wallet 
  and go outside the system that those credentials.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  ever form they take can use in 
  a.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): I'm meant to link to data 
  that's in CTL in the registry so that there is meaning beyond 
  what is actually limited amount of data that's in the credential 
  package itself so this is a pretty straightforward use case that 
  has immediate value in terms of making the credentials that are 
  issued to people easier to understand.
<phil_l_(p1)> Leveraging linked data for lean transport!
Brooke_Lipsitz: How complex is that to set up with CT DL.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Not not at all so like when you 
  showed that list of courses and credentials those are in some 
  sort of structured data because they're structured in your system 
  so either from The Source or from tln you could take the basic 
  even it doesn't even have to be a lot of fields of data but you 
  can even just put that in a spreadsheet it doesn't require an API 
  integration to.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  push it to the registry.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Then when you issue a 
  credential for any one of those courses or credentials to include 
  in the alignment a link to that data in the registry so when you 
  first set that up the data that the data that's in the registry 
  might be slim but then you can add to it over time so you could 
  have for example very valuable thing is to add the competencies 
  to those credentials and courses and then it can grow over time.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine):  I'm do include transfer value 
  Pathways whatever.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): You don't need to get into 
  those more complex use cases to just provide a connection between 
  the credential that's being issued and additional metadata does 
  that make sense.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Yeah that makes sense.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): We're happy we're happy to help 
  with that and I put a link in the chat to a very short overview 
  document on that topic that's applicable for any digital 
  credentials.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Yeah thank you Deb really appreciate it.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): There's there's a ton of 
  potential here so I'm just really happy to to see what are some 
  of the some of the practical ways to enrich it from very 
  beginning so.
Brooke_Lipsitz: Definitely appreciate and we're open to input 
  across the board to especially because we're still so early in 
  our development so any any ideas or any thoughts anyone wants to 
  share even after the call I'm happy to learn more about so thank 
  you.
Kerri Lemoie:  It's great thank you everybody does anybody have 
  any other questions or feedback or comments they like to give 
  birth before we close today.

  it's great to see it and for that for everybody else to see it to 
  you so thank you for being here today and walking us through it 
  all and being open to all the feedback and suggestions that's
