<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Sure so I raise this PR in response to sort of looking at our initial design that we had for the VC API going back a couple of years now and it seems like we might have had some of the sort of authority model flipped in the configuration model flipped for how I think the API should work effectively we have a situation where we&apos;ve created an API where the client. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Additionally the issuer may not even be able to combine those those those selected parameters in to produce something valid in response so that the the issue itself details some of those gets into some of the details and give some examples of that the other problem with this is the authority model is kind of flipped where instead of having a party that setting up the issuer create a set of valid configurations and then saying client applications you can use these. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  There&apos;s that party to just to just say I&apos;ve made all my keys and all of my everything available to anyone who has access to this API you combine things however you want to use it and I don&apos;t think that that&apos;s the right way to approach the problem and I think some of that has come out of trying to optimize the API for building a test Suite that allows us to mix and match a bunch of different features to prove interoperability but that doesn&apos;t optimize for real you real world use case and for parties that. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Clients are able to have access to different keys to issue so that it can limit blast damage and for a variety of other security and privacy reasons and so on so that proposal that PR kind of my original approach was I&apos;m going to start chipping away at the parameters that are available to this API to explain that the client can&apos;t really just pick and choose these parameters its problematic and or a responded to that. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:   That asking me. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Create a larger issue that sort of says instead of chipping away at these one at a time why don&apos;t you make a proposal that in a more unified way talks about how we might readjust the API to address the concerns that I put in that PR and that&apos;s in I think number 267 is where that proposal is so that&apos;s kind of the whole issue that&apos;s on the table its kind of re looking at the be Capi trying to understand what we optimized it for with our design originally and whether or not. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  Okay thanks folks can hear me awesome just wanted to also mention that security has already implemented a similar approach on our implementation of the VC API was more geared towards multi-tenancy but when you register an endpoint you do provide some of the parameters that you would want to support as. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  When the API is called those parameters are applied so I think this is approach an approach that secure key would be interested in in fleshing out as described in the issue 267 and we think I think we&apos;re aligned but you know we need to explore further but it&apos;s something we&apos;re already looking at in that entrust blog platform. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yeah this this new approach was also designed with multi-tenancy in mind and it also shows some of these concerns also came out of noticing that the existing approach does not work very well for multi-tenancy you&apos;ve got to try and mount what the the existing API on to the end of some kind of other configuration that allows for multi-tenancy and then you immediately start running into these problems where clients are. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:   Are trying to ask. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Four things that they can&apos;t actually have or that the issuer can actually do or that if the issuer did do could create privacy problems just as one example that is listed in that PR. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;orie&gt; pretty sure clients can always ask for things that are not supported... thats what http 400 is for.</div>
<div class="information">&lt;dave_longley&gt; not a great client experience though :)</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  All right thanks Dave um I&apos;m gonna go ahead and share my screen because the pr itself that we&apos;re looking at is actually quite tiny but again I mean it opened up a huge kind of discussion I think Dave with this PR you&apos;re just like remove the verification method you shouldn&apos;t be able to set that it should be kind of configured on the endpoint. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;orie&gt; well its pretty good when the API documentation makes it clear.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  And I think what Mike and Dave are saying is that this is kind of the URL structure that they&apos;re expecting in this did come up very early in the BC API discussions I think we said hey look let&apos;s not say that this is hard coded that it has to be at the root of your the root of viewer kind of URL path so the root of your domain you should be able to tack the VC API onto the end of stuff. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="comment"><span class="name">Orie Steele</span>:  So I think the a couple things and then first we support versions of this API with multi-tenancy already and I agree with Dave that the current API definitions make that little awkward and encourage clients to request things that might not be supported so you&apos;ll have no I have no objection to the idea that the API should be. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
