<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Created as an oid C version of the chappie issuer playground which uses VC API in chappie so it&apos;s got two protocols that it uses today to move credentials from an issuing platform to a wallet it uses just straight chappie and then chappie to provide a VC API endpoint which then you do a VC API exchange and Kyle. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): You said that a coyote or what&apos;s the duct. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah so it&apos;s as far as I think Patrick I understand it these two sites effectively do the same thing the matter launch pad does it for open ID for VCI in the chappie playground does it for VC API in chappie to protocols go ahead Dave. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yeah just have a quick question because Patrick you said that the QR code has a did web URL in it I would have expected it to be an open ID initiate issuance URL so that when I QR code comes up if you use a wallet that supports open ID connect verifiable credential issuance it could scan that QR code and get that oid C4 VCI URL. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Dmitri Zagidulin</span>:  It is it is a initiate issue it&apos;s got ya. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Okay yeah so this playground is just doing delivery of the credential or you know this launch pad is doing delivery of the crown jewel through oid C4 B CI instead of through the VC API you can build a similar site that used to be Capi in the background the do all the exchange all of the issuance and verification stuff but the VC API does delivery either directly through choppy or. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:   Through exchanges URLs and. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Oid C4 B CI QR code is an alternative to that mechanism you could you know put a exchanges URL in a QR code to do it through BC API but effectively what&apos;s going on is a different protocols being spoken to do the delivery. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): Interesting I will definitely spend more time experimenting with it it&apos;s very interesting and it&apos;s just a side note I totally forgot to the committee of data we had a consultation with company called volte and they want to develop test Suites for oid see. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-195').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-195').show()" id="195" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I&apos;d say we shouldn&apos;t do it until we find that we need to do it and I don&apos;t think that anyone here is saying that we know that we need to do it anywhere yet trying to think if they&apos;re there probably are. <a id="link-195" style="display:none;" href="#195">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-196').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-196').show()" id="196" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  There are cases I know where we should if we&apos;re not already be returning error codes for like duplicate issued VCS but again that&apos;s like a 409 status code can indicate that so I think we need to find cases where the HTTP status code is insufficient and if it&apos;s insufficient then we then we would mandate something but until then we should just say that you can return it if you are going to return an error you can return it. <a id="link-196" style="display:none;" href="#196">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-197').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-197').show()" id="197" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We expect you to return Json of some kind but we don&apos;t have to say what it is and it could be implementation-specific as Ted said both for what you return and whether or not it&apos;s configurable to return the biggest terrorists as 10 put so I think until we know that we need something more than this we shouldn&apos;t mandate that people do something. <a id="link-197" style="display:none;" href="#197">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-198').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-198').show()" id="198" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  What about if I can implementation decide to return an error code where the spec doesn&apos;t say to return one. <a id="link-198" style="display:none;" href="#198">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-199').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-199').show()" id="199" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  By Eric oh do you mean yeah I certainly think implementation should be allowed to return errors but at this time they should be understood to be implementation-specific so no one using it should rely on that to be the same across different implementations. <a id="link-199" style="display:none;" href="#199">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-201').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-201').show()" id="201" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): Yeah I agree with this I think covering all state to code possible is a must for case that might need more information I&apos;m thinking maybe some kind of specification that two different errors could return the same error code they would be good to know the the reason for it in the case that some implemented would want to return more detail about the ever I. <a id="link-201" style="display:none;" href="#201">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-202').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-202').show()" id="202" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): Good idea to have a sort of predefined Shimmer for how ever bodies should be but leave the content at the ends of the implementer that would be the than what comes to mind for me. <a id="link-202" style="display:none;" href="#202">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-209').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-209').show()" id="209" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Yeah I worry that using the camelcase error response here is a little perhaps too prescriptive it does making it sound like if you&apos;re going to send an error response that has to match this schema and I think what we want to do instead is say this is a suggested schema but you can do whatever you want and then we should additionally probably bike shed with that schema is since people won&apos;t since it&apos;s their people will use it or we should remove it because if we&apos;re not. <a id="link-209" style="display:none;" href="#209">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-216').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-216').show()" id="216" class="information">Patrick_(IDLab): I&apos;m just thinking also like if we go back to the test Suite like in the case we want to have like a negative test you know like the test like is invalid credential idea or whichever and we want to analyze the response to match the test might be better to do if there&apos;s this like predefined ever Shima and that could be another reason. <a id="link-216" style="display:none;" href="#216">✪</a></div>
