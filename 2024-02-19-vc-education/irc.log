[2024-02-19T16:12:00.082Z]	<Simone_Ravaioli>	https://europa.eu/europass/en/stakeholders/european-digital-credentials
[2024-02-19T16:12:17.553Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah so uh.
[2024-02-19T16:12:21.029Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I want to I want to talk about uh.
[2024-02-19T16:12:33.255Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: European learning Model A little bit so 1 of the things that I'd really love for us to do in this group in 2024 is to really highlight.
[2024-02-19T16:12:42.731Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Trajectories uh the North American versus European versus Pacifica.
[2024-02-19T16:12:48.737Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh verify credentials communities are taking with regards to.
[2024-02-19T16:12:54.727Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Credential schemas right so so my question is is twofold uh.
[2024-02-19T16:13:02.255Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 could you say a couple words about the trajectories of the different communities that you seeing.
[2024-02-19T16:13:12.234Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In this mapping project which again is very exciting I'm really glad that it's going on do you think will will arrive at a place where.
[2024-02-19T16:13:15.727Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The credentials are largely.
[2024-02-19T16:13:24.257Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Equivalent in the sense that you can map between them yeah I'll start with that and I'm glad to see um Deb on the queue as well.
[2024-02-19T16:15:23.762Z]	<Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine)>	detailed documentation of the micro-credential mapping project https://docs.google.com/document/d/172umnUUU7Dix230FjfSUNUD1GYCkFIqD93WeWzr4_yQ/edit#heading=h.iaoab75j1kxc
[2024-02-19T16:15:51.568Z]	<Transcriber>	Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Yeah sure mostly I wanted to say thank you um I think I you Dove right into the schema mapping and um I'm really happy that we did scope it to the um micro credentials specifically and thanks to Simone for helping us come up with that strategy um because.
[2024-02-19T16:15:59.503Z]	<Transcriber>	Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Um we are ambitious about doing um a more comprehensive mapping of.
[2024-02-19T16:16:05.499Z]	<Transcriber>	Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Sitting there to Elm and other schemas around the world.
[2024-02-19T16:16:26.173Z]	<Transcriber>	Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): This is it's it's not even that small but it's um scoped and yet it's really powerful because when we look at the credential landscape and a lot of the chaos that's out there and how people have trouble figuring out which credentials mean what um.
[2024-02-19T16:16:44.650Z]	<Transcriber>	Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): It's so much confusion around microcredentials so if we can shed even a little bit of light in terms of how micro credentials from 1 jurisdiction mapped to those in another jurisdiction were super proud to be supporting that effort.
[2024-02-19T16:16:46.851Z]	<Transcriber>	Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Thank you again.

[2024-02-19T16:18:14.025Z]	<Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine)>	overview of the project https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLgq5gqc-JpRxSvarVU_DRjNzZrWzsYRtxuduwz7erc/edit
[2024-02-19T16:18:57.378Z]	<Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine)>	access to the mapping itself https://desm.credentialengine.org/mappings-list
[2024-02-19T16:20:17.492Z]	<Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine)>	the micro-credential mapping is completely open and Credential Engine welcomes collaborators
[2024-02-19T16:21:27.947Z]	<Transcriber>	Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Yes I do and um so I I'll I'll share something with you which is that um as some of us were you know geeking out on this mapping and how it would be done um RC our CEO very smartly said.
[2024-02-19T16:22:16.237Z]	<Transcriber>	Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Why is this important and so to provide a non-technical explanation of why this is important and why it benefits people who have Micro credentials um to be able to get better used and opportunities out of those um and so really we see the mapping um as as interesting as it is it's just the beginning in terms of taking this as a way to understand the similarities the differences the transferability whether or not these micro credentials are truly portable in terms of being useful all of those important discussions um Can emerge from better clarity about what's inside those micro credentials.
[2024-02-19T16:22:52.529Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah it's President's Day in the holiday in the US so I suspect a lot of people are in Holiday mode and not taking any meetings Etc.
