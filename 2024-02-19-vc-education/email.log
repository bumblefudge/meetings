<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> yay, thank you!
Simone Ravaoli: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ildikomazar/
<kaliya_identity_woman> I cant here anything
<dmitri_zagidulin> @kaliya - try switching browser or machine. 
  sorry bout that.
Simone Ravaoli: 
  https://europa.eu/europass/en/stakeholders/european-digital-credentials
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah so uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I want to I want to talk about uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  European learning Model A little bit so 1 of 
  the things that I'd really love for us to do in this group in 
  2024 is to really highlight.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Trajectories uh the North American versus 
  European versus Pacifica.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh verify credentials communities are taking 
  with regards to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Credential schemas right so so my question is 
  is twofold uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 Could you say a couple words about the 
  trajectories of the different communities that you seeing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In this mapping project which again is very 
  exciting I'm really glad that it's going on do you think will 
  will arrive at a place where.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The credentials are largely.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Equivalent in the sense that you can map 
  between them yeah I'll start with that and I'm glad to see um Deb 
  on the queue as well.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> detailed documentation of the 
  micro-credential mapping project 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/172umnUUU7Dix230FjfSUNUD1GYCkFIqD93WeWzr4_yQ/edit#heading=h.iaoab75j1kxc
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Yeah sure mostly I wanted to 
  say thank you um I think I you Dove right into the schema mapping 
  and um I'm really happy that we did scope it to the um micro 
  credentials specifically and thanks to Simone for helping us come 
  up with that strategy um because.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Um we are ambitious about doing 
  um a more comprehensive mapping of.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Sitting there to Elm and other 
  schemas around the world.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): This is it's it's not even that 
  small but it's um scoped and yet it's really powerful because 
  when we look at the credential landscape and a lot of the chaos 
  that's out there and how people have trouble figuring out which 
  credentials mean what um.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): It's so much confusion around 
  microcredentials so if we can shed even a little bit of light in 
  terms of how micro credentials from 1 jurisdiction mapped to 
  those in another jurisdiction were super proud to be supporting 
  that effort.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Thank you again.
<simone_ravaioli> Draft Micro-credential Schema Mapping Project
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> overview of the project 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLgq5gqc-JpRxSvarVU_DRjNzZrWzsYRtxuduwz7erc/edit
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> access to the mapping itself 
  https://desm.credentialengine.org/mappings-list
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> the micro-credential mapping 
  is completely open and Credential Engine welcomes collaborators
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Yes I do and um so I I'll I'll 
  share something with you which is that um as some of us were you 
  know geeking out on this mapping and how it would be done um RC 
  our CEO very smartly said.
Deb_Everhart_(Credential_Engine): Why is this important and so to 
  provide a non-technical explanation of why this is important and 
  why it benefits people who have Micro credentials um to be able 
  to get better used and opportunities out of those um and so 
  really we see the mapping um as as interesting as it is it's just 
  the beginning in terms of taking this as a way to understand the 
  similarities the differences the transferability whether or not 
  these micro credentials are truly portable in terms of being 
  useful all of those important discussions um Can emerge from 
  better clarity about what's inside those micro credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah it's President's Day in the holiday in 
  the US so I suspect a lot of people are in Holiday mode and not 
  taking any meetings Etc.
