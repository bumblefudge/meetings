Topic: Introductions & Reintroductions

Hello, all. I
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Philbarker

Hello. I'm having problmes with Linphone. I'm a member of Trust 
  Over IP Internet of Education Task Force. I'll join chat for now
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Moving on to universal wallet

Topic: Universal Wallet

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Universal wallet proposes a data model 
  interface (api) -- experimental implementation
  ...advantages: covered by w3c license agreement;
Orie Steele:  +1 To experimental implementation -- title should 
  include interop and experimental as it is transitioned to the w3c
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Wallet is like an SDK or api -- doesn't have 
  to be used; can be applied to multiple use cases and 
  interoperability
  ...can use spec without opensource implementation
  ...ip protected as well
Orie Steele: Yes, we probably should have named the spec, 
  "Universal-Wallet-Interop-Spec" and the sample implementation 
  "Experimental Universal Wallet Implementation", even if the 
  software package does not contain the word "experimental".
  ...common for proposals to be discussed in DIF and IEEE
  ...credential exchange spec is in draft
  ...secure data store relevant to wallet storage
  ...Learning economy major contributor and open wallet 
  architecture
Jacksohne:  Speaking
  ...Learning economy building universal wallet out of necessity 
  for interacting with partners
Orie Steele: Some more "experimental ui for the experimental 
  wallet" here: 
  https://material-did.com/?path=/story/universal-wallet-wallet-cards--unlocked 
  :)
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Need code owner -- will be Nathan and T?...
Juan Caballero: I am here
Juan Caballero: Agenda is here
Juan Caballero: 
  https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/blob/master/agenda.md
  ...get involved via ccg, github, etc.  Also get involved in 
  DIF; send questions to Kim
Juan Caballero: If anyone wants to propose an agenda item for a 
  future DIF interop meeting or email me directly at communication 
  at identity.foundation about it
Adrian Gropper: What makes this a "learner" wallet?
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Add yourself to the queue if you have strong 
  objections to adding experimental implementation
Orie Steele:  Asking about implementing a software implementation 
  along side the spec?  Should we move Transmute code to CCG?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Speak up if you have concerns
  ...kim is supportive of experimental implementation -- very 
  helpful to demonstrate POC;
  ...experimental implementation doesn't have to be used...
  ...we want open source and open implementation available to all 
  learners
  ...not tied to a specific wallet vendor; interacts with many 
  identity proof mechanisms
Adrian Gropper:  I imagine a learner wallet is a customized 
  version of a wallet that supports the 
  "universal-wallet-interop-spec", which MAY use the 
  "experimental-universal-wallet" [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Adrian Gropper:  Question -- what makes this a learner wallet vs. 
  just a wallet
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Learning wallet a certain kind of universal 
  wallet -- themed in different ways specific to learners
Orrie:types of industry specific wallets are conformant with 
  standard but support open interop standards?
Adrian Gropper:  Will there be anything different than the data 
  model between patient walled and universal wallet?
Orrie: speculating about differences...
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Interesting that this has a data model and 
  interoperable library / interface
  ...in addition differing credentials ...
Orie Steele: I consider defining abstract interfaces data model 
  work :) but thats just my personal opinion. there have been 
  concerns raised about the "interfaces" and if they can be generic 
  enough to be supportive of all formats
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Modeling verifiable credentials next
Thank you. dropping for remainder.

Topic: Modeling Educational VCs

Sry my line is keep dropping
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Document has several working examples; 
  action items moved to a specific section
  ...action item-- support xml serialization focus
Orie Steele: Interested to see the XML serialization of VCs added 
  to the W3C VC Data Model.
  ...jason too
  ..."has achieved" is being adopted
  ...better for broader types of achievements
  ...use of pdf's for the wrapper?  follow up work item...
Orie Steele: I have done experiments embedding stuff in PDFs... 
  CBOR-LD can help.
  ...issues in document -- working example 1
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pt-VNnjoYgl23Mlu0Tjyax5RgANPBfDijERz0SNYfSo/edit?ts=5f387d19#heading=h.wszlu0mk5nza
  ...ILR wrapper is referring to criteria in alignment framework 
  --
  ...ctid supports versioning -- is advantage
Orie Steele: We should consider cannonical URLs for credential 
  Ids, that support CTID, but also other formats
Nate Otto:  Ctid = identifier for a registry provider;  basically 
  a UID; doesn't think this serves all of the needs; alternate 
  identifier...
Simone Ravaoli: +1 To Orie and Nate
Phil Long: +1 For Ori's suggestion
Orrie: suggests ctid as an argument vs URL
Nate Otto: +1 To Orie's proposal: It is nice to have a canonical 
  URL identifier that when fetched can reveal more information 
  about the credential definition that is the canonical 
  representation of the credential.
Tzviya Siegman:  Agrees with orrie about keeping it separate
Nate Otto: (I could describe OB's approach to version 
  identification if somebody wants to q me for it 
  https://openbadgespec.org/#version )
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Avantage is assigned to resource
Anthony Camilleri: We have quite a bit we would like to 
  contribute to this discussion. the appropriate thing is to just 
  comment the doc extensively?
Nate Otto: Open badges use description -- does not need to know 
  about versioning but needs badge class
Phil_Barker: On "resource" in ctid: Credential Engine uses ctids 
  on Learning Opportunities and Assessments as well as Credentials
  ...url badge class can be the latest version or defined
  ...version can define the type of credential
Orie Steele: Yep, big +1 to being careful about forcing folks to 
  worry about versioning if they don't need to.
Nate Otto:  Where are we at with vocabulary "has achieved"?
Orie Steele: Schema.org will take PRs :)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Ccg can be temporary landing place
  ...could also be schema.org
Phil_Barker: Is this relevant https://schema.org/hasCredential
Orie Steele: Schema.org has the benefit of helping align with 
  SEO, which might be favorable, for reputation driving credentials
Orie Steele: Yep, +1 to bucketing  in CCG and preparing to 
  register a batch to schema.org
Tzviya Siegman:  If more than one term in shema.org we should 
  batch terms...
Anthony Camilleri: Not sure the super-personal data in 
  credentials necessarily aligns with schema.org public data 
  prinicples....
Juan Caballero: Thx all!
