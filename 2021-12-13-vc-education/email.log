  browsers for my audio to work as well
<colin_reynolds,_learning_economy> ðŸ˜ž
<phil_l_(p1)> Update to Chrome broke Jitzi audio and switching to 
  Firefox gets around the problem.

Topic: Simone Ravaioli - Canada & Europe Standardization Updates

<phil_l_(p1)> Simone -  sharing with possible actionable items 
  for next year. Two significant workstreams in the Stds. world re: 
  VCs happening outside the US
<phil_l_(p1)> CIO strategy council in Canada working on VCs
<timothy_summers> Keep getting kicked out, wondering if I'll need 
  to switch browsers as well.
<phil_l_(p1)> Draft specification will be shared in the minutes.  
  It is a sister initiative - may be people in the call 
  participating on the discussions about the Canadian standard.
<phil_l_(p1)> We should stay aligned with the Canadian 
  workstream.
<phil_l_(p1)> The other initiative is restarting in the EU, 
  Another group CEN, is also working in this space.
<phil_l_(p1)> The group is getting restarted after initial works 
  several years ago. Now working on a business plan and new scope 
  of work. We should have a liaison with these two efforts.
<phil_l_(p1)> Later see links in the chat

Topic: End of Year Recap & Planning for 2022

<phil_l_(p1)> Kerri - proud of the work this group has done built 
  on the foundational work by Kim Hamilton Duffy, and of the LER 
  work that opened options toward VC directions.
<phil_l_(p1)> Now started work on both single assertion 
  credentials with OBv3 and more complex credentials with CLRv2. 
  Should have some candidacy for a new standard in late first 
  quarter or second quarter of 2022.
<phil_l_(p1)> Have gone through a lot of use cases and now should 
  be a focus of coming work in the new year.
<phil_l_(p1)> We have two new co-chairs in Simone and Dmitri
Kerri Lemoie: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-ed
<phil_l_(p1)> If you have thoughts for what you think VC-EDU 
  should work on in the new year, or create issues in the Repo 
  directly.  The Repo is in the chat.
Kerri Lemoie: Phil_L_(P1): gates funding for focus on single 
  assertion endorsement credentials to be worked on: establish a 
  collective to work on this amongst all groups.
https://www.cencenelec.eu/european-standardization/european-standards/
<timothy_summers> The Pocket team is interested in being in the 
  loop, we've made lots of progress in the area of endorsement 
  credentials.
<phil_l_(p1)> Thank you Dmitri!
<phil_l_(p1)> Open Recognition Alliance and the Open Recognition 
  group at the Open Skills Network has contributions to make in 
  this endorsement skills VC design process

<phil_l_(p1)> Highland has released Blockcerts_v3  - anyone in 
  the community has some understanding on how the blockcerts 
  community is doing, keeping track of their work etc.
<phil_l_(p1)> If so please share info. Kerri has reached out to 
  them to join us Jan. 3rd (that is the Blockcerts group).
<phil_l_(p1)> Dmitri is interested in making sure that there is 
  sharing and cross-pollination of this space in 2022.
<phil_l_(p1)> Kerri's prediction is some draft model docs for new 
  VCs will be out in mid-to-late VCs.
