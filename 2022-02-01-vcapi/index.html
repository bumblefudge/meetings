<div onmouseout="$('#link-2').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-2').show()" id="2" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We have a discussion on workflow so the the kind of one of the goals of this call is to try and align two calls in the VC API with what the traceability folks are doing and so we&apos;re going to attempt the whole call today is going to be focused on getting that kind of alignment so that has to do with the start workflow and then the presentation availability. <a id="link-2" style="display:none;" href="#2">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-3').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-3').show()" id="3" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  With either workflow interaction or the submit presentation call so they&apos;re just two calls therefore calls now we&apos;re going to try and boil them down into two calls if possible or just get a plan together and how to do that there&apos;s also some issue processing that we need to do Mike I think you raised the concern about controller style and point the pattern that we&apos;re using for the API and so maybe we want to change that and then there&apos;s this. <a id="link-3" style="display:none;" href="#3">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-4').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-4').show()" id="4" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Flo IDs and names should they be in the URL or should they be in the post body so those are the items that we have for discussion today and then we&apos;ll do issue processing if we have any time left over which I doubt we&apos;re going to have any updates or changes to the agenda anything else folks want to discuss today. <a id="link-4" style="display:none;" href="#4">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-5').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-5').show()" id="5" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Okay is there anyone new to the call or anyone that would like to reintroduce themselves. <a id="link-5" style="display:none;" href="#5">✪</a></div>
<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Introductions and Community Updates</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-6').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-6').show()" id="6" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  All right is there are there any Community updates specifically relevant to be Capi. <a id="link-6" style="display:none;" href="#6">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-7').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-7').show()" id="7" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I do think it&apos;s probably relevant mentioning the chartering. <a id="link-7" style="display:none;" href="#7">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-8').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-8').show()" id="8" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Disagreements that are happening right now for those of you that are not aware BC apis there&apos;s a suggestion by Microsoft that any kind of protocol work any kind of API work in the VC 2. <a id="link-8" style="display:none;" href="#8">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-9').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-9').show()" id="9" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Co-working. <a id="link-9" style="display:none;" href="#9">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()" id="10" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Escape completely don&apos;t want to talk about protocols none of that stuff there are a couple of us that are engaging in that thread we would appreciate others chiming in one of the concerns here is that we want to. <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  One of the concerns there is that we want to publish a note around the work that we&apos;re doing in this group just to set it up so that we can take it standards track during the next recharter which would be in 2 years or whenever the work you know when of the working group finishes its work there. <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yourself seems to be pushing back pretty hard on that Phil you asked why currently Microsoft is trying to get open IDC the protocol in as the protocol to move mobile driver&apos;s licenses around there has been a decent bit of pushback on mdl as it&apos;s currently formed because it doesn&apos;t take into account verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  And this is just my opinion my expectation is Microsoft would like to see that happen over open I DC connect and having another protocol out there that moves verifiable credentials around places that approach into question. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I will pause and other people that you know other people may want to speak to that as well anyone want to put themselves on the Queue to speak to that. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Yeah and II think that there&apos;s definitely some folks working pretty hard on going down like you know open ID can act as a path for exchanging credentials right and I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going to change right when we look at the way you know who&apos;s involved Etc I do think that there is a potential path forward to do so and in fact I opened a PR for it man oh I don&apos;t know if you saw that all. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  I think 66 all lengths. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  But basically this a look let&apos;s go ahead and very explicitly in the non-normative side of things from a developer you know be able to give developer documentation guidance etcetera put up possibly as an extension or set of extensions on top of the existing implementation guide for a rest API definition such as we&apos;re talking about here but also not to rule out guidance on how to handle you know if you&apos;re going to exchange credentials via open it. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:   Eid connect we should be able as working group to discuss that. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  His well basically right because I don&apos;t it&apos;s gonna take a little while to get to some consensus on that and I think the danger that I see is that if we try to push back hard on open ID connect or push back hard on something else that they you know we may see what more resistance to saying look any protocols you know for exchanger discussion of that even in a non normative ways out the. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:   Window and that&apos;s that&apos;s. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  More dangerous I think from an adoption standpoint. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Sure and in the suggestion isn&apos;t to say you can&apos;t do open ID connect it&apos;s it&apos;s yeah absolutely if you want to do open ID connect and move these around on it that&apos;s great we should be able to talk about that in the group and if the folks in this group want to see the VC API as a part of that discussion we need to put it in scope so the concern here is that if we don&apos;t put the document we&apos;re working on right now squarely in. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  From a non-normative standpoint there will be. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  About it right so that is that is the concern that I have is that if we do not make it very clear that we can talk about VC API and publish it as node and all that kind of stuff there will be objections to doing that once the working group starts up go ahead Joe your. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Joe Andrieu</span>:  I think you mean stop talking about it in that working group which is not the context we&apos;re talking about that now so it still wouldn&apos;t prevent us from continuing the ccg work on it or charger in another working group to actually standardize it all right. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;mprorock&gt; we will move on from it and not dedicate resources if it is not in the WG</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That is partially correct remember this is now somewhat of a race in open ID has its own foundation and you know these participants are active there in all they have to do is stamp something as a standard of they&apos;re done it&apos;s a it&apos;s a global standard and then all of a sudden the VC API is a why do we need that when we already have this other standard out there right so. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  They think it&apos;s a bit concerning if we just continue to work on this as a community group and it continues to be referred to as a yeah but that&apos;s just some random group of people on the Internet working on it rather than it being actually discussed the spec itself in published as a note in the verifiable credential working group so that we can take it standards track. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Yeah I think I was going to say some of what you were saying there but I will clarify like for instance just because of limited resources and having to pick our battles like if honestly like if some kind of a rest API and I think putting a reference in directly to the VC API as it stands today is not the worst idea but it you know if that&apos;s not as part of that working group honestly we&apos;re going to probably. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Try we just have limited resources to go dedicate to it especially if there&apos;s a clear path to like an open ID connect path right so that&apos;s the that&apos;s the difficulty I see I vastly prefer arrest for all of these interactions right so that&apos;s part of the reason I&apos;m making the effort here and you know opening PRS I and you know discussing on the issues over on the work group you know Charter discussion because I think it&apos;s important to have a clear restful. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Yeah let&apos;s think I was going to say Manu if if you want to suggest on that PR you know like a such as and then a link to the VC API or something I&apos;m happy to I think that&apos;d be a good way to at least get the conversation going in one place on that yeah cool thanks. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  All right so let&apos;s go ahead and move into our first topic then which is the start workflow presentation availability convergence discussion so let me go ahead and share my screen here one second. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There are currently two calls in the VC API that effectively do the same thing one of them has been in there for a while and that is the presentation availability availability and point in the purpose of this endpoint please correct me if I&apos;m wrong here Mike is to basically kind of. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Have some presentations available to the server so you&apos;re the client and you&apos;re contacting the server and you&apos;re like I&apos;ve got some stuff that I&apos;d like to send you the server then responds with potentially be PRI VPR a verifiable presentation request and it&apos;s like okay well if you want to send those things to me here&apos;s some here&apos;s some instructions on how you do it the start workflow. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;mprorock&gt; yep, Query By example, Challenge, etc</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  As opposed to end point in when you post data to it the workflows kind of encoded as a in the URL and it says okay if you want to start that workflow with me here&apos;s a verifiable presentation request so the only thing that differs between these two endpoints is the data that you post to it the start workflow call just takes any object it&apos;s just like just send me it&apos;s. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   It&apos;s not very specific. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In the expectation here is that the server once it receives the object will understand oh you want to do that kind of workflow with me and you gave me the data to kind of kick it off and here&apos;s your presentation request and then you go back and forth on that the presentation availability and point is a little more specific in that you actually I think Mike you send it a VPR but it&apos;s effectively an. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Checked you send it an object and it responds back with a. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Want to send me that information here the things that you need to hear the things you really need to send me and the thing that&apos;s usually returned in both cases is like a domain and a nonce and a challenge and they like that kind of stuff like the credentials it wants to see that sort of thing so there was a lot of effort put into this to try and make this call to start workflow call a superset of the presentation availability. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So the I think the proposal here is can we merge these both down into one thing the suggestion is can we do the start workflow one and then the trace folks specify in the traceability spec that they want this object to be a VPR. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
