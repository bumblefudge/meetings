Topic: Charter edits review

Review charter
Kerri Lemoie: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAdC1mBSP-p6zxXGRQNfSQNPe5MY6UZ6Tf676oY7BOk/edit#
Was more focused on LER wrapper and HE
Now adjusting to broader focus and including training and 
  employment contexts
Need feedback this week to be able to confirm charter
This doc should provide intro and history for anyone who has 
  questions about what this group is doing
Scope is broad-- see Scope section of charter doc
Marty-- "may include" is important because these points are broad
Patrick- this fits well with what we are doing in Germany
Working on conversion of EMREX standard to VC standard
<kerri_lemoie> public-vc-edu@w3.org
Reminder of mailing list for outreach and sending more info to 
  the group
Approaches to interoperability-- see this section of the charter 
  doc
Marty Reed:  In scope, should we include the application of 
  verifiable presentations- Marty will add this
Many important questions and use cases related to verifiable 
  identity and verifiable presentations
Work items process-- see this section of the charter doc
Important to focus on use cases, including current, future, and 
  theoretical-- we need more use cases
Anyone in the group can take on and lead a work item
Kerri Lemoie: ADL: standards for military & government
ADl is widely adopted beyond government and military
ADL is often an initiator or incubator of standards that are 
  taken on by others
Jim Goodell:  ADL is like a de factor standards organization
Deb Everhart:  Not a priority for this group to be too specific 
  about what technically is a "data standards organization"
It would be useful for someone from HR Open to come to this call 
  to talk about the relevant standards
Deb Everhart:  Focus on achievements of all types, wherever they 
  occur, as distinct from other types of credentials such as 
  employment date/job records
<phil_l_(p1)> Andrew Cunsolo has been invited to speak about some 
  of the HR Open work at the next OSN Technical Workgroup.  I'll 
  check  with Nate but I believe it's set for Oct. 22nd. at the TWG 
  Friday 2:00 pm meeting.
<phil_l_(p1)> :-)
Marty Reed:  Including endorsements in the scope of this group
Focus on use cases this month and next month
Charter available for 7 days for review, until Oct. 25
<kayode_ezike> Can we add comments to the doc?
Kerri Lemoie: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAdC1mBSP-p6zxXGRQNfSQNPe5MY6UZ6Tf676oY7BOk/edit#
<kayode_ezike> Great, thanks!
Yes, you can add comments to the charter doc
Seeking concensus on the charter by Oct. 25, so please provide 
  comments asap

Topic: Work Item: Use Cases

Use case document-- specific template

  https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Sj4FcbxkbUIC2yVv_XKF-6U6zDzwdIE1l83CAiP2JQ/edit
Kerri walks through a HS Open Badges use case example, see doc
<david_ward> The use case template (first link) does not seem to 
  be publically readable.
<jim_goodell> I need to drop. Have a good day all.
<kerri_lemoie> template doc permissions updated: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QcPTXUuhcJdQFPcj0F31MVg8QTGtOsSx93E7D6L4ZSI/edit?usp=sharing
Phil Barker:  Important to have use cases that cover both the 
  badge holder and the badge consumer
Deb Everhart:  +1 @Phil and also how does CTDL provide the 
  consumer with more info and context for recognizing the value of 
  the credential for inclusion in the college app
Marty Reed:  Multi-lens, ecosystem view of each credential
Phil Barker:  Use case views for different perspectives that 
  together form an ecosystem perspective
Sharon Leu:  Value of keeping use cases simple, and challenges 
  etc are distinct-- eg 1 interaction scenario w/ 3 use cases
Deb Everhart:  Yes, scenario + use cases is a useful structure-- 
  and the scenario and additonal use cases can be built out later
Marty Reed:  Walking through use case for ETS praxis results
Everyone take a shot at writing a use case by next week
<phil_l_(p1)> Does the general statement that the recipients of 
  the Praxis VC can't import data from a VC mean a business 
  opportunity?
