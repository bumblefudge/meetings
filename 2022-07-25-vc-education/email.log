Kerri Lemoie:  Can you folks hear me okay.
Kerri Lemoie:  Great hey welcome to the Monday July 25th call for 
  verifiable credentials for Education. Our main topic today is 
  essential as identifiers 101 we're going to do some basic 
  introductions to what did tsar and based on the decentralized 
  identifier specification that was just approved.
Kerri Lemoie:  And we'll take a slight BC I do angle to this but 
  it's going to be a pretty basic calls that we can start setting 
  up some 101 documentation and get your questions and hopefully 
  answer some of them.

Topic: IP Note

Kerri Lemoie:  We have a few things to go over before we get 
  started the first is the IP note anyone can participate in these 
  causes are open calls however all substitutive contributions to 
  any of the ccg work items specification items should be done by 
  members of the credential community group with full IP our 
  agreement signed to do that first you would sign up for a W3 
  account and then you would join the ccg the credential.

Topic: Call Notes

Kerri Lemoie:  Secondly these meetings and audio recording for 
  these meetings we do a transcription so you will see a robot 
  transcriber you probably see it right now in the chat and we also 
  do an audio recording and I believe we are doing video recordings 
  of these calls if you see the transcriber is going awry and I'm 
  saying things that haven't been said or misinterpreting language 
  you can go ahead and help.
Kerri Lemoie:  As with this so we can the most.
Kerri Lemoie:  Get minutes passed.
<kerri_lemoie> how to correct the transcriber: s/wrong/correct
Kerri Lemoie:  By doing substitutions right in the chat and it's 
  easy and you can do this by Titan s /o wrong term and then 
  correct one and I just put this in the chat right now let's see 
  how to wreck the transcriber.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you I missed calls we also use a cue system 
  so DQ yourself up please put a q+ in the chat and Duty or remove 
  yourself from the queue predict you - I'm if you know what your 
  comment is about is helpful for us to know so maybe we can leave 
  it into the conversation you can cure yourself up with with the 
  words following like the topic description.
Kerri Lemoie:   Like this.
Kerri Lemoie:  And then I'm going to remove myself from thank 
  you.

Topic: Introductions & Reintroductions

Kerri Lemoie:  Okay why don't we start with some introductions 
  and reintroductions is there anyone who's new to the call today 
  or has come back to the fall today and would like to tell us 
  about themselves and maybe we can reduction or tell us about work 
  that you're doing anything that's changed for you just 
  queueyourself up right now and we'd love to hear from you.
Kerri Lemoie:  My folks are debating that I'm going to do a 
  substitution right now.

Topic: Announcements & Reminders

<kerri_lemoie> Upcoming CCG Meetings & Events: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/announcements/
<kerri_lemoie> VC-EDU Task Force mailing list, you can join here: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-edu/
Kerri Lemoie:  Have announcements and reminders first is that any 
  sort of upcoming ccg events are usually announced on this page 
  also there is a public mailing list for the CG where agenda 
  announcements are sent out before the the primary group we also 
  have a mailing list specific for VC edgy that you can join here 
  I'll put this in the chat for you.
Kerri Lemoie:  And this is actually an archive page so you can 
  click on this link and see all archived emails that happen on 
  this thread there is a subscribe link that's a mail to link that 
  you can use to join the list and all you do is send the email 
  with subscribe in the subject you don't need a message for that.
Kerri Lemoie:  Does anybody else here today have any 
  announcements.
Phil_L_(P1): If you can hear me I'll be happy to make one Carrie.
Phil_L_(P1): One two one two no.
Kerri Lemoie:  Phil long once you try again I don't see you in a 
  few and I don't hear you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I could hear it though.
<simone_ravaioli> Yes
Phil_L_(P1): I guess I better hear me now.
<kate_giovacchini> Hearing Phil
Stuart Freeman:  Yes I hear you.
Phil_L_(P1): You heard me.
<john_kuo> I can hear Phil
Phil_L_(P1): Okay doesn't look like Carrie can.
Colin,_Learning_Economy: Here you go it's kind of strange I think 
  others said they could hear as well.
Phil_L_(P1): Can you hear me.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Wait Harry can you hear us.
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay Phil and I touch base with you towards the 
  end of the call and then see if you have some damn you okay.
<kate_giovacchini> Can Kerri hear anyone else? Yeah.
Phil_L_(P1): Try again John.
<sharon_leu> I can hear you, Phil
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Do you care.
<simone_ravaioli> Yes
<colin,_learning_economy> We can hear you Kerri!
Kerri Lemoie:  Carrie here I am the one with sound issues 
  apparently you can hear me though which is good give me one 
  moment.
<colin,_learning_economy> But not sure you can hear us
<phil_l_(p1)> Kerri there are others who can hear me but each 
  other
<kate_giovacchini> Check speaker--I had mine off. LOL
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay Phil can you try that again I think I may 
  have fixed my idea.
Phil_L_(P1): Alright is this better.
Kerri Lemoie:  There you are yeah sorry about that please take 
  the floor.
Phil_L_(P1): That's all right I'm off and have trouble connecting 
  attended yesterday just a quick note that we have submitted a 
  paper to the rebooting the web of Trust on the endorsement 
  credential which we use some time ago you and I will put the link 
  for that in chat is going to be here.
https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/endorsements.md
Phil_L_(P1): And and we will be holding a session hopefully 
  sometime in the near future at another we see edu meeting.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thanks Phil you know you Phil's been working on 
  this for a long time and really been pushing pushing this topic I 
  had it's just take a look at this and read our thoughts on this 
  and how how this can be done we'd like to work with all of you in 
  this open community.
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay the queue is empty Dimitri and Simone do you 
  have anything before I get started on our dids 101.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Nothing for me.
<phil_l_(p1)> Thanks to Dmitri for his expert guidance on the 
  endorsement credential work, and Kerri for critical input and 
  comments
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay thank you thanks feel free to I jump in at 
  any time and also let me know if there's anything in the Keel so 
  I can kind of keep an eye on it I'm going to share my screen.

Topic: Main Topic: DIDs 101 at VC-EDU

Kerri Lemoie:  Hey can you see my screen.
Phil_L_(P1): Yes we can.
Kerri Lemoie:  Website before we get started Jonathan I see you 
  just added yourself to the queue I took yourself off from the 
  queue are you all set.
Jonathan_Bethune: I didn't do a thumbs up.
Kerri Lemoie:  Oh good thank you okay.
Kerri Lemoie:  Hey Sue the aims of this discussion.
<kate_giovacchini> P1, please put yourself on mute.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm having a little bit of feedback.
Kerri Lemoie:  If you have your mic on would you mind.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> it's Phil L
Kerri Lemoie:  Harold I'm having audio issues today.
<kate_giovacchini> GTG
Kerri Lemoie:  Still there we go okay that's much better thank 
  you all right.
Kerri Lemoie:  Themes of today's call is to basically have an 
  introduction to decentralize identifiers and why this matters for 
  us for educational training and achievement verifiable 
  credentials we're going to be doing this sort of deconstructing 
  the did core specification really at a very I was at a very high 
  level but also at a we're going to take in a little bit but we're 
  not going to get into.
Kerri Lemoie:  How do you actually implement this.
Kerri Lemoie:  It's so it is sort of a broader understanding of 
  how it did Czar how they work why we need them and and some 
  examples of what they look like.
Kerri Lemoie:  Then we're going to do is we're going to see if 
  some questions come up and later on we're going to turn these 
  slides into the archive of this call into my resource so please 
  feel free to ask your questions and I guarantee that if you have 
  them that others have them to also we have quite a few people on 
  the call today and I know that many of you are very much more 
  deeply experienced and knowledgeable about it so I hope that you 
  can jump on the Queue and share what you know as well.
Kerri Lemoie:  Hey so why did he need this.
Kerri Lemoie:  So we have right now we use a lot of globally you 
  need at Affairs telephone numbers email addresses usernames on 
  websites government ID diverse domain names and none of these are 
  under our control very we rent them we someone gives them to us.
Kerri Lemoie:  We have they were taken away from us right so for 
  instance or also they could be replicated like how many times 
  have you gotten a phishing email spam email or even you know a 
  text that looks like it's coming from somebody and these are 
  things that exist out in the world that we use to like represent 
  ourselves and to communicate but they don't actually represent us 
  they are created by us at all and then you know that's how the 
  area has been all along that's how you know it's probably going 
  to be for some time.
Kerri Lemoie:  But in the meantime.
Kerri Lemoie:  So we can that you can shift this a little bit.
Kerri Lemoie:  We should also note that in educational 
  credentials like badges we've historically use email addresses to 
  represent the Learners and this has been a problem because 
  Learners May or individuals idlers may use lose those email 
  addresses from your institutions or employers may take away those 
  email addresses I know like I've encountered this where I've had 
  accounts with email address and then if I can't access that email 
  address anymore then I can't prove that I have control over it if 
  you.
Kerri Lemoie:   Can't prove that you've contributed.
Kerri Lemoie: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19ghZWblVjB7ozW_VkgjXgy10kUvnqiC-ws8V7cO9xKg/edit#slide=id.g13ebe55d3de_0_67
Kerri Lemoie:  All over the identifier that you are using for a 
  credential that you can't really prove that credential is yours 
  and maybe sometimes it doesn't matter in the short term but in a 
  matter longer in life and that's sort of what we want to think 
  about when you I'm going to put the link to the slides here in 
  the chat for you so you can follow along and have access to all 
  the links.
Kerri Lemoie:  I am minor 7th slide I've made links to that pet 
  that section of the dock and also any sort of ancillary 
  references so for instance at the bottom of this document we have 
  a link to the did use cases where you can read more about why 
  we're going to be like how we could use did some of those use 
  cases are.
Kerri Lemoie:  So what is it right attend size identify or a did 
  is a globally unique identifier.
Kerri Lemoie:  It can that the specification says that it refers 
  to any subject us to be a person organization a thing a data 
  model abstract entity anything and I was as however the 
  controller of the did decides and.
Kerri Lemoie:  We talked about it in this context more for 
  education or training or to cheat if you my credentials but dudes 
  can also represent books or you know supplies you mostly they're 
  used for Supply management now than anything else but it because 
  in this context we want to use people be able to use them in 
  organizations be able to use them we're investigating them more 
  right here at VC-EDU.
Kerri Lemoie:   So did Zara.
Kerri Lemoie:  Unique identifier they can be created by 
  individuals organizations to represent themselves they create 
  them they create them using some kind of a tool provided to 
  create them whenever they want however they work that is it the 
  plan anyway that is the idea they can also be deleted right the 
  control is should be right there by the individuals or the 
  organization's you can have as many as you want you can use them 
  as many different contexts as we want and that is very.
Kerri Lemoie:   Different than how we use identifiers online.
Kerri Lemoie:  Did Sarah Fenton hated by proof of control using 
  cryptographic groups and so what does that mean right this means 
  cryptographic ography Works in a way that the way we haven't 
  talked about it here anyway is public and private key pairs so 
  you have a private key and that means that it is associated with 
  a public key that public can see I often use a house analogy for 
  this where you.
Kerri Lemoie:   You might have the address of where I live but.
Kerri Lemoie:  Key to get into that house and is the private key 
  that actually proves control of ditz and we're not going to get 
  too much into the different proof methods and encryption types 
  that are out there we could probably have another call about that 
  as we get closer to cluckfest to but today I think it is enough 
  probably to know that if you create a did.
Kerri Lemoie:   You typically have.
Kerri Lemoie:  I have a key that you control to prove control of 
  that did we are going to show one other example though called did 
  with that that breaks that move just a little bit.
Kerri Lemoie:  And I'm just going to check the queue and see if I 
  should pause there there's any questions.
Kerri Lemoie:  This is what it looks like.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm giving us even the cutest give them get 
  through this part and then we had colony.
Kerri Lemoie:  So did see are your eyes they associate a did 
  subject with a did document the did document describes how a did 
  can be how the proof of control can be verified.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um the actual statement from the specification 
  says dids are you are eyes that Associated did subject with a did 
  document allowing trustable interactions associated with that 
  subject and they look like.
Kerri Lemoie:  And you are eyes actually looks like the sweet 
  example of another kind of a URI is a URL instead of did here 
  which describes describes the scheme of this URI you are much 
  more familiar with seeing HTTP which describes how to access your 
  l in a web browser.
Kerri Lemoie:   With the did.
Kerri Lemoie:  You have the.
Kerri Lemoie:  Mm did this is the says this this URI is did and 
  this is the did method and the did method describes there's so 
  many of them it describes how this did can be verified it points 
  to the did documents now get that a little bit more but each each 
  method provides different ways of proving control of the did and 
  then lastly is the unique identifier for that did method.
Kerri Lemoie:  But David you have the floor.
<phil_l_(p1)> Actually you can control the identifier in the 
  sense that you can create it or remove it.  The question of how 
  credible the DID doc references that give someone multiple 
  attributes about you is a different question.
<phil_l_(p1)> Similarly the question of key backup is a different 
  question as well.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm going to call on TV tree but first I just want 
  to say thank you for sharing your opinion David I'm today we're 
  just reviewing what is in the document certainly there are 
  challenges to consider with any technology and appreciate you 
  bringing that up Dimitri.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I just wanted to follow on you David.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The famous line in this is not even who is 
  controlling like yeah there's an enable digital a lot more 
  control about they're both identity but even for institutional 
  control.
<kate_giovacchini> A little hard to hear--maybe that mic can be 
  closer.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Did provide a number of technical features 
  that made even if none of the power structures control structures 
  or anything like that changes did Stone able to use previous 
  systems just much easier much better with probation revocation 
  capabilities Discovery capabilities and and in addition to giving 
  us say.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A bigger URL space than just the web for 
  example in which to explore theirs.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thanks to entry I think it's great to have this 
  time this rounded discussion about it and I'm just going to get 
  back to our unpacking of the the did Doc did course back now and 
  and then we hopefully will have some room at the end of the call 
  to have further discussion about this topic.
Kerri Lemoie:  In the next section I that I have here in the 
  slides come right from the the document from the specification 
  this is the design goals of the centralized identifiers and I'm 
  going to go through them pretty quickly here so that you sort of 
  understand what the aims are for centralized identifiers and and 
  understand sort of that angle of it a little bit better so here's 
  here's what the specification spills out.
Kerri Lemoie:   The first thing on the list is.
Kerri Lemoie:  Actions and seeds to eliminate the requirement for 
  centralized authorities or single point of failure and identifier 
  management including the registration of globally unique 
  identifiers and public verification keeps.
Kerri Lemoie:  Second is control.
Kerri Lemoie:  This gives and his employers identifiers aim to 
  give entities with human and non-human the power to directly 
  control their digital identifiers without the need to rely on 
  external authorities.
Kerri Lemoie:  Next is privacy dids enable entities to control 
  the privacy of their information including minimal selective and 
  Progressive disclosure of attributes or other data.
Kerri Lemoie:  It may have security dids enables efficient 
  security for requesting parties to depend on did documents for 
  their required level of assurance we're going to talk about did 
  documents a little bit next and how they work.
Kerri Lemoie:  Did the naval did controllers to provide 
  cryptographic proof when they're interacting with other entities.
Kerri Lemoie:  Discoverability makes it possible for instance he 
  discovered bids for other entities to learn more about or 
  interact with those entities.
Kerri Lemoie:  Interoperability which we talked about a lot here 
  in this space especially verifiable credentials use interoperable 
  standards so that the did infrastructure can make use of existing 
  tools and software libraries designed for interoperability we're 
  going to have two tools that we're going to talk about in a 
  little while.
Kerri Lemoie:  Did she system our aim to be system and network 
  independent and enable entities to use a digital identifiers with 
  any system that supports dudes and did methods and simplicity 
  dudes favor A reduced set of simple features to make the 
  technology easier to understand and Implement and deploy.
<davidc> I wonder why none of the comments I made have made it 
  into the minutes, yet Dmitri's response did?
Kerri Lemoie:  Extensibility when possible we are possible Disney 
  able extensibility provides it does not greatly hinder 
  interoperability portability or Simplicity that's how they worded 
  it in the documents reading it right from there let me see who is 
  in the queue I think I heard someone come up okay.
Kerri Lemoie:  Is how do you dudes work.
Kerri Lemoie:  Like we said above I'm dids are you arise that 
  associate the did subject with a did document that allows 
  trustable interactions associated with that subject.
Kerri Lemoie:  This screenshot right here in the slide is it a 
  base example very simple example of a did document that is in the 
  specification.
Kerri Lemoie:  This document contains information that's to 
  associate with the do such as ways to cryptographically 
  authenticate the controller.
Kerri Lemoie:  It's method of the did that explains how to 
  retrieve this document the document and how the proof of control 
  of the did can be performed for that method.
Kerri Lemoie:  Is that does anybody have anything they want to 
  ask right now I don't see anyone in the queue but I just want to 
  make sure that everybody is all with me.
Kerri Lemoie:  So we're going to go through three examples.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um these were chosen these three examples were 
  chosen because they were the top three methods that are being 
  used by the plugfest one participants.
Kerri Lemoie:  Is a no favoritism in my apart this is just what 
  the data shows the first one though is that did key.
Kerri Lemoie:  So this is what it did he look like.
Kerri Lemoie:  And you can see it is a did the name of the method 
  is key and then here's a you guys identifiers in this example.
Kerri Lemoie:  The document for a dick he explains the 
  cryptographic method that's associated with the did and it looks 
  like this.
Kerri Lemoie:  This also provides the information that you need 
  to prove control over did key note that I did he doesn't use a 
  blockchain at all it relies on the holder of the did to prove 
  that they have control of the private key that is associated with 
  the public key in the did document and that is that there is no 
  blockchain involved there's no writing to a blockchain is simply 
  stored on a computer that is being used or the the app the mobile 
  device that's being used is generated there and stored there.
Kerri Lemoie:  Did kids use being used a lot right.
Kerri Lemoie:  Now because it's really.
Kerri Lemoie:  Did Implement there's a lot of libraries for it 
  and most of the implications right now least in our VC Edge you 
  space are the pilots that are using this.
Kerri Lemoie:  Next example that we have here.
Kerri Lemoie:  Did web is based on the URL this note that I put 
  here comes from the did word explanation here in the registry is 
  the fully qualified domain name that secured by TLS or SSL 
  certificate eyes with an optional path to a did document and how 
  this works is that someone applies for a domain name at a 
  register and then they associate a domain name with an IP address 
  where it can be located and then it did.
Kerri Lemoie:  And with the json-ld that looks something like.
Kerri Lemoie:  This is actually stored on that server where that 
  domain is and and that is how that one works there are no keys 
  involved it is all done through the SSL register and improving 
  control of the domain.
Kerri Lemoie:  The third one that's the most popular being used 
  because especially it's a very early one is did sov.
Kerri Lemoie:  Only in red here because that's how it is in the 
  specification this is a screenshot it doesn't it's not read 
  because you know read to me is a very strong color anyway this is 
  an example of a did self and it's created on a public blockchain 
  called Sovereign it reads directly from Sovereign and then I'm 
  did document is generated from that what is the results of the 
  poll from The Sovereign blockchain and then proof of control is 
  still based on the cryptographic key pairs.
Kerri Lemoie:  Those are three examples that we have but as the 
  publication of the did spec there are over 130 this said 103 103 
  sorry it's it's a lot prettier.
Kerri Lemoie:  Will it typically means user need to look up all 
  of these dad's probably not most applications will decide which 
  ones to implement an overtime America will probably decide which 
  ones that use the most and but until then probably there's going 
  to be more before there will be less and what we have to look up 
  dudes is it did specification registry and it contains an 
  alphabetical list of the did methods put it right here.
Kerri Lemoie:  Quite a few of these are using blockchain in fact 
  I think maybe all of them are using black chain or some describe 
  how to move from one black change to another I believe that is 
  how how Carrie Works although I need to learn a little bit more 
  about that some are Ledger agnostic to you.
Kerri Lemoie:  This tree actually serves as the official registry 
  and it stores all known Global parameters the property is the 
  values so all of these documents here actually our reference from 
  the from here so all of the information you want to learn how to 
  read the document retrieve the document and verify that did all 
  could be stored in the registry and so you can learn how to do 
  that and decide which dids your applications are going to use.
Kerri Lemoie:  But now we have a couple of tools.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm just going to highlight today one is did actor 
  we used it after quite a bit during the plugfest I'm did actor 
  you can create and resolved it you can also create and verify 
  credentials and presentations.
Kerri Lemoie:  Really super easy to use and it's a good way to go 
  in and just play with play with things I don't know how many 
  different types of did you can eat it looks like maybe you can 
  only create did key on here but still it's a way to try that out 
  and see how that works.
Kerri Lemoie:  Secondly we have a universal resolver so with the 
  resolver does as is it says this is how this it retrieves the 
  actual document and I think that Marcus Marcus from Danny Tech is 
  here Marcus are you here today so you'd mentioned you would be 
  hearing kids her talk about Universal resolver if you are.
Markus Sabadello:  I'm I'm here yes sir okay.
Kerri Lemoie:  Hi do you mind explaining the resolver.
Markus Sabadello:  Yes no problem.
Kerri Lemoie:  Would you like me to hand the screen over to you 
  or should I just leave it on the screen here.
Markus Sabadello:  Are you can can also leave it here with you 
  for now I think you've I think you've already explained all the 
  important Concepts very well so as you as you said that it's have 
  Associated the documents and you also explain the concept of 58 
  method I and as you as you said there are a lot of them and for 
  each did method the process how you get from the deed to the 
  document is very different right you.
Markus Sabadello:  That some did method.
Markus Sabadello:  Use block chains and added methods to not use 
  block chains and that's one of the features of the it's if you 
  think about it is kind of abstraction layer and and the fact that 
  it's can work very differently underneath so that this process 
  how you get from the D to the document initially a few years ago 
  when we started to work on this we thought they would all be 
  blockchain based on we thought we would need different did 
  methods because you know there was.
Markus Sabadello:   There was.
Markus Sabadello:  There was a theory mm and there was Sovereign 
  then there was various one and then those were all Ledger's and 
  we thought that's why we need did methods but over time the 
  concept of a did method has become much more flexible and people 
  have come up with very Innovative types of these including things 
  like the web and did these key that that you mentioned but what 
  they all have in common is that there's always these resolutions 
  step 4 you can get to the document and the universal resolved 
  arisen.
Markus Sabadello:   Implementation of I think about 45 different.
Markus Sabadello:  You can pass in a dedicated web Deeds of the 
  in the end and so on and it will be able to resolve it and it 
  does that by using a set of what we call drivers right so it has 
  a list of drivers and each driver implements added method and 
  that's how it becomes a Universal resort branded can be useful in 
  scenarios when when you're building applications.
Markus Sabadello:  Services that you want to be.
Markus Sabadello:  Headed with this.
<kerri_lemoie> Article by Markus about the DID Resolver: 
  https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540
Markus Sabadello:  It methods to and this can be a useful tool of 
  course it also has some some drawbacks probably on the technical 
  level it's a pretty heavyweight service it's operated as a 
  service with remote endpoint right so you you run it as a as a 
  remote service it may introduce some dependencies that you may 
  not always always one so for example if.
Markus Sabadello:   If you're if you're just building.
Markus Sabadello:  Occasions and services that that should work.
Markus Sabadello:  State weapon did key then probably you don't 
  need this tool because it's very easy to resolve it weaponed Tiki 
  and you don't need to use such a heavy weight remote service like 
  the universal resolver but if you want to be compatible with many 
  did methods and then this could be useful and a final thing I 
  will say is this is a community maintained or right so this is an 
  open source project at the decentralized identity Foundation.
Markus Sabadello:   Ian and those drivers those.
Markus Sabadello:  So stay calm from different.
Markus Sabadello:  They typically come from the same Community 
  that's also that also invented the did method right at that's the 
  intention if you decide if you design a new did method and it 
  would be nice to also contribute a driver for the universal 
  resolver so that people can can resolve your you did method.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you Marcus is great one question I have for 
  you is I'm you mentioned that it's a service is there some open 
  source code or libraries that could people can install on their 
  own their own applications instead of using the service.
Markus Sabadello:  The whole thing is open source so what you're 
  looking at here the user interface the API and the set of these 
  these drivers you can take all of that and you can deploy it on 
  your own server right so people are not really supposed to rely 
  on on this one instance that you're looking at where it says 
  they've taught you need to resolve a totally oh that's one 
  instance of the universal resolver which diff is operating for 
  the community and maybe it's it's good enough for some.
Markus Sabadello:   Mentation but you should not rely on this 
  one.
Kerri Lemoie:  I guess that.
Kerri Lemoie: Github: 
  https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver
Markus Sabadello:  And point there's also a warning little 
  warning sign on the top right corner of the of the page so if you 
  yeah it is one sexy it explains the downsides of this but it's 
  open source and you can run your own instance of that instead of 
  relying on the the instance that you're looking at.
Kerri Lemoie:  I just had a link to get Hub in the chat is that 
  the correct Repository.
Markus Sabadello:  Yes that is the that is the source repository 
  and that has some some information also on how it works and how 
  to contribute drivers and how to install it it maybe I can.
Kerri Lemoie:  I think you owe us okay.
Markus Sabadello: 
  https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar
Markus Sabadello:  Maybe I'll just quickly also post the second 
  repository so there's a lesser-known second open source project 
  which is called Universal registrar so that's a similar idea 
  similar design but that is not for resolving these that's for 
  creating and updating and deactivating deeds and it's a bit more 
  experimental it's not so much here and it doesn't support that 
  many did methods but it's.
Markus Sabadello:   Also modeled after the universal resources.
Markus Sabadello:  Yeah but but for creating and managing these 
  rather than resolving DIDs.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thank you Marcos it's great really appreciate this 
  work that you all do.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm also looking here I was looking at the GitHub 
  repo for a good actor I'm going to put that in the chat as well.
<kerri_lemoie> github repo for did actor: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did.actor
Kerri Lemoie:  His folks who are interested in doing this might 
  be able to look at that source and sort of back into how they 
  would create it's on their system.
Kerri Lemoie:  The queue is still empty the last thing I had for 
  for today for now is all of these are all of the references that 
  were mentioned throughout these slides the only one that I did 
  not reference here didn't get into it too much at all actually is 
  it did rubric and this may be interested interesting to some of 
  you who are trying to evaluate.
Kerri Lemoie:  Kids to you.
Kerri Lemoie:  The did rubric is a scoring guide that's used to 
  evaluate evaluated and you can take a look at that and and see 
  the examples that they have provided some really well if I did 
  like you know what is the what are the processes what are the 
  requirements and then what are some examples and how they were 
  scored just to give you a comparison for how you would evaluate 
  dids for your own systems.
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah that is the end of the slides for now and 
  what I have to present for now as part of this did one on one 
  does anybody have any questions they would like to ask their you 
  think others on your teams may have and we can do our best to 
  answer them or you know have any other sort of discussions about 
  its while we're here especially in relation to a verifiable 
  credentials for education.
<john_kuo> Thank you Kerri this is a great overview
Kerri Lemoie:  Hey David you have the floor.
Kerri Lemoie:  I don't know it didn't.
Kerri Lemoie:  I mean I can restart the transcriber thank you for 
  noticing that it doesn't say that it's not running and I see it 
  transcribing here so I'm not sure it's capturing everything.
Kerri Lemoie:  I don't I don't think so I don't have any controls 
  and it should not be specific to any individuals it is just based 
  on whatever is all based on the Google transcriber and so it does 
  picks up whatever here's and does its best to translate you know 
  vocals the words.
Kerri Lemoie:  That's a good question I don't know what browser 
  are you using because I can help.
<simone_ravaioli> Thanks for flagging this, David. Let us look 
  into it.
Kerri Lemoie:  It should work with Firefox I'm going to look into 
  that I'm not using Firefox right now that I'm planning on 
  switching to that so that's good to know I think some people are 
  because we were having trouble with with other browsers yeah 
  thank you for mentioning that so we can look into it.
Kerri Lemoie:  Absolutely we'd like to capture as much as we can.
<simone_ravaioli> the audio recording will be ok
<phil_l_(p1)> I'm using firefox as well. 102.0.1 (64-bit). So if 
  my comment is in there it's not Firefox dependent
Kerri Lemoie:  Fortunately we do have the audio and that will be 
  sent out with the minutes but I'll take a look at that.
<stuart_freeman> I'm using firefox and it transcribed something I 
  said earlier
Phil_L_(P1): Yes thank you.
Kerri Lemoie:  You have the floor yep you have the floor.
Kerri Lemoie:  David can you hear me.
<david_ward> I guess you can't hear me.
Kerri Lemoie:  I can't hear you.
<simone_ravaioli> no.
<phil_l_(p1)> No I can't
Kerri Lemoie:  It's not me again can anybody else here David not 
  me okay good.
<geun-hyung> No I can't
Kerri Lemoie:  Sorry did you want to type something into the 
  chat.
<david_ward> I wanted to ask about the design goal of 
  discoverability.
Kerri Lemoie:  The design goal of discoverability.
<david_ward> I haven't seen anything showing how to discover DIDs 
  of other entities.
Kerri Lemoie:  Make it back to that slide here.
<david_ward> Are there examples of such yet?
Kerri Lemoie:  That's a good question so I David says he hasn't 
  seen anything showing how to discover dudes or other entities.
Kerri Lemoie:  And that is good that's a good question to be 
  treated you I do you know anything about discovering did it but 
  any sort of work out there that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sure and Marcus so absolutely right the 
  question of Discovery is associating did with anti-government 
  companies or people.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thomas Malthus depend on.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I'm the ways of animals.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For example there's facts that'll allow you if 
  you know Innovations or so the person.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Allows you to discover what the did that 
  empties using from what essentially a file that you post on your 
  website that's one option another option is to bootstrap.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So you again you know somebody's URL you can 
  load their schedule.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That's an onboarding sort of way to relate 
  Legacy information like do rails to companies but obviously not 
  everybody is going to be hosting every dollar on the way home 
  what other another approach taken by the community is the notion 
  of prospects.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For example here in the case.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Not carry things like name of these do stand 
  for it.
Kerri Lemoie: Sidebar: is anyone else using firefox who has 
  participated in the audio?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Propelled with that they could be put into 
  service so would provide is a directory much like phone days we 
  have the White Pages Yellow.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  How do you discover I didn't phone number.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Other methods of bootstrapping process.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They did that have to do with physical places 
  by.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To our codes and offices for Michael Kamen.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A part of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Contact you know spending of your business 
  card is a discovery may know the entity and I see are a bunch of 
  identify you know phone number and now did so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All of the techniques from phone and email 
  days of Discovery apply plus we have.
<david_ward> Thank you.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thanks to meet Ray Marcus.
Markus Sabadello:  I agree with everything that Dimitri said I 
  can think of one more potential approach to discover teeth 
  remember that a lot of the did methods are based on lectures or 
  blockchains which means that in for some of the did methods all 
  the DIDs are globally visible right if you create a sovereignty 
  it or you create an FC T it or anion.
Markus Sabadello:   Eat it then.
Markus Sabadello:  Anyone can see all the Deeds that exists 
  globally and often you will not know anything about these things 
  right so in many cases the data is just the deed and there's no 
  other data associated with it which is often a good thing and 
  therefore you don't really know anything about it but in theory 
  it would be possible to have also public data associated with 
  those publicly visible Deeds right for example.
Markus Sabadello:   I've heard some.
<kerri_lemoie> Folks may find Phil Windley's explanation of DIDs 
  helpful: 
  https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml
Markus Sabadello:  Use cases are or ideas we're at the heat in 
  that the document could have a service endpoint which points to 
  some place for example the centralized web node or something else 
  but it points to something where you can actually discover public 
  information about the date like the name of the organization for 
  example and if you do that then then you couldn't see a read 
  index all those public Deeds plus all the data that's available 
  about it and you.
Markus Sabadello:   Could have something like Google of Deeds.
Markus Sabadello:  Sickly but your index the dates with the 
  associated public data and that's something that hopefully would 
  be done for Deeds of organizations and companies are not so much 
  for personalities but that could be another approach where were 
  you then run searches or Discovery processes against this Public 
  public set of tits.
Kerri Lemoie:  Anybody else have any questions.
Kerri Lemoie:  Kate you have floor.
Kate_Giovacchini: And I just want you to repost that link to the 
  Google slide deck could you do that.
Kerri Lemoie:  I sure can.
Kerri Lemoie:  Here you go.
<kerri_lemoie> slide deck: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19ghZWblVjB7ozW_VkgjXgy10kUvnqiC-ws8V7cO9xKg/edit#slide=id.p
Kerri Lemoie:  Ideally what we do is take this slide deck 
  Gathering your questions and put this out there as a resource on 
  the VC edgy website and start compiling more and more resources 
  because we're getting to the stage where more and more pilots are 
  happening and more and more questions are coming in and it's just 
  time to start building up documentation to help folks really get 
  started and digging into this and in my experience.
Kerri Lemoie:   Experience a multi-modal.
Kerri Lemoie:  Coach to this works works best when you have very 
  many different documents to look at and documentation to 
  reference and at some point different parts of each one help 
  gather understanding and this is how I work as a developer 
  sometimes it takes me 20 different references before it really 
  clicked with me and I know I've got it right.
Kerri Lemoie:   And we'd like to do the.
Kerri Lemoie:  You help folks get it right.
Kerri Lemoie:  Anybody else have any questions.
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay about four minutes left so I'm going to let 
  folks have that time back I appreciate all of you being here 
  today I will do the minutes soon and send those out and of course 
  feel free to reach out with any questions and I will see you next 
  week.
