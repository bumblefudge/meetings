<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The things we&apos;re going to cover today is just kind of some of the security privacy and format challenges that exist when you&apos;re doing verifiable credentials or digital credentials of any kind uh we&apos;re going to talk about how the parallel signature solution tries to address some of those uh challenges we&apos;re going to go through some examples of like how it works like high-level examples of how it works and then uh discussion either during or or at the end um. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Let&apos;s kind of talk about some of the challenges that motivated uh the work um. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  When when we have when you know when we&apos;re doing verifiable credentials or digital credentials of any kind um there are a number of challenges that we have to kind of meet we have to meet all of these challenges write 1 of them is the security challenge which is like how do we digitally sign. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Verifiable credential in a way that follows government cryptography standards uh and there are many organizations that kind of publish cryptography standards that are used by government uh nist uh Etsy Triple E ISO all publish cryptography standards and then governments decide whether or not they&apos;re going to they&apos;re going to use it um in that decision tends to be somewhat separated from Private Industry like Private Industry tends to adopt cryptography more readily um um or earlier than than most governments do and when governments basically. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  They&apos;re going to. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Pop some level of cryptography. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  They really mean it like that is they and they expect their vendors to comply and systems built to comply and all that kind of stuff um the reason is is because it has National Security implications if you choose a week digital signature format it could be a national security risk okay so 1 of the 1 of the challenges is getting the security right in a way that like governments and big organizations are going to adopt it. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The other thing when we secure our verifiable credentials uh has to do with like privacy challenges um so. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  You know how do we digitally sign something so that an individual&apos;s privacy is protected um specifically how do we enable selective disclosure and how do we enable unlink disclosure uh so the difference between those 2 terms is selective disclosure allows you to like show certain fields in let&apos;s say like a driver&apos;s license so you can share only your address or only your date of birth right that&apos;s selective disclosure uh but the thing usually what&apos;s selective disclosure is it&apos;s not on linkable meaning like if you show that you&apos;re over 21 using like an mdl at 1 website and then you do it at another website well the digital signature on that um that credential that you send over the selectively disclosed credential is correlated with it&apos;s trackable so the sites could get together and collude and start tracking you as you go from site to site proving your age. <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Linkable disclosure on the other hand um makes it so you can&apos;t be tracked the digital signature changes every time you do that presentation and as a result it&apos;s unlink 1 website can&apos;t link your usage to another website so we have these privacy challenges uh and a lot of government cryptography today does not support unlikable disclosure for example so that&apos;s why it&apos;s a challenge to meet both of those at the same time. <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-53').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-53').show()" id="53" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   The Third. <a id="link-53" style="display:none;" href="#53">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-57').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-57').show()" id="57" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I&apos;ll go here is um um basically an embedded format so you can you have enveloping signature formats and embedded signature formats so we&apos;ll go on Option 1 talk about that which is the enveloping signature format um so the the idea with the enveloping format is like you have 1 verify credential um but you end up copying that um into different envelopes and the envelope is a security mechanism it&apos;s you can think of it like you know writing a message down putting it in an envelope and then sealing it with a wax seal like that&apos;s your digital signature um the nice thing about enveloping formats is like they&apos;re much simpler for security software implementers so the people that are writing the cryptography libraries have a easier time uh uh uh uh creating these kinds of signatures because the the the code that you write to do it is just kind of straightforward right um. <a id="link-57" style="display:none;" href="#57">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-58').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-58').show()" id="58" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That every time you want a new feature set you have to invent a new enveloping format right and so uh if you want selective disclosure well you have 1 approach but if you want on linkability well you&apos;ve got to create a new enveloping format um and so on and so forth um so it&apos;s it&apos;s more complex for people writing digital wallets and verifiers to deal with all these different you know enveloping formats um there&apos;s a lot of protocol complexity that comes in uh because you know if you&apos;re going to issue for example a driver&apos;s license that is both selectively disclosable and on linkable and follows you know government cryptography standards um you would have to digitally sign this credential you&apos;d have to you know copy it multiple times and put each 1 in a different envelope. <a id="link-58" style="display:none;" href="#58">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-60').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-60').show()" id="60" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Time you want to add like a specific type of signature to it with different capabilities you just kind of attach it to the end of the verifiable credential so you have 1 payload that has multiple different proofs on it uh now the benefits here is that like it&apos;s a Json data structure so you can continue to process it as Json uh you don&apos;t have to like encoded in this envelope that&apos;s opaque that you can&apos;t you know see through um it&apos;s simpler to manage for most developers because most developers know how to just deal with Json um and the security format the the mechanism is the same between selective disclosure between full disclosure selective disclosure and unlabel disclosure the the payload stays the same it&apos;s just like the verifiable credential and all you&apos;re doing is kind of like attaching these proofs uh to it um it&apos;s also simpler for uh devs that have to manage and process VCS like they can take these things and just directly put them in the database instead of having to like. <a id="link-60" style="display:none;" href="#60">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-85').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-85').show()" id="85" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So uh proof sets and proof chains are different um I would say that proof chains are not really parallel signatures um uh they they have different uses so a proof set is like you have a piece of paper in multiple people sign put their signature on that piece of paper like literally they sign the piece of paper um but none of their signatures are dependent on the other right it&apos;s just like you&apos;ve got a piece of paper and you&apos;ve got 8 people signatures on it and maybe you only need 1 of those signatures to prove you know what you what you want to prove so they&apos;re made in parallel they&apos;re not dependent on 1 another. <a id="link-85" style="display:none;" href="#85">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-86').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-86').show()" id="86" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Our signatures that are dependent on 1 another so you can think of like a notary use case where you go into a notary with a piece of paper and the notaries like show me your ID and you show me your ID and then they&apos;re like okay sign this piece of paper. <a id="link-86" style="display:none;" href="#86">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-87').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-87').show()" id="87" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  They always have you put your signature on the paper before they put their signature on the paper because what their signature is supposed to do is proved that you signed that thing you know in front of them so that&apos;s an example like a notary is an example of a chained signature where you put your signature on it first and then the notary puts their signature on it and so there you can combine these things and like arbitrary ways um but fundamentally that&apos;s that&apos;s the difference between these things and and just today I&apos;m only talking about proof sets I&apos;m not talking about proof chains um would that help. <a id="link-87" style="display:none;" href="#87">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-179').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-179').show()" id="179" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I so so I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen in the future right so there there are exceptions to what the question that you asked but I&apos;m going to try and ignore those for now so I think in general. <a id="link-179" style="display:none;" href="#179">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-180').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-180').show()" id="180" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  You should only be sending 1 of these signatures right you should only send an ecds you you should decide if the if the verifiers allowing you to decide between unlined you should pick unlink like by default um and you should only and and in that case you should only send the unlink disclosure because if you send the other proofs you will end up being correlated right um however the the caveats to what that your question is like well what happens if they&apos;re like multiple signatures that are required well the verifier can ask for the specific signatures that they want so let&apos;s say you have a set a set of signatures where you require like 2 or 5 signatures um the verifier can say I want signatures from person a and or issuer a an issue or B an issue or a c like they can they can request that and then if you have those proofs then you know that the verifiers is not going to be happy unless you send all 3 different types of signatures. <a id="link-180" style="display:none;" href="#180">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-181').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-181').show()" id="181" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   But then. <a id="link-181" style="display:none;" href="#181">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-182').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-182').show()" id="182" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That&apos;s mildly different. <a id="link-182" style="display:none;" href="#182">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-183').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-183').show()" id="183" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  From like picking between the type of disclosure you you want to combine. <a id="link-183" style="display:none;" href="#183">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-184').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-184').show()" id="184" class="comment"><span class="name">Patrick St-Louis</span>:  So the you mean like the verifier you could request based on a specific verification method like if he knows you wants verification method that&apos;s suppose support selective disclosure. <a id="link-184" style="display:none;" href="#184">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-185').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-185').show()" id="185" class="comment"><span class="name">Patrick St-Louis</span>:   You could. <a id="link-185" style="display:none;" href="#185">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-187').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-187').show()" id="187" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah definitely well I mean not only that it it&apos;s it&apos;s there&apos;s selection between the type of cryptography that&apos;s used right so the verifier can say I want this specific type of cryptography like for example I am the US federal government I only uh support ecdsa or ecdsa SD and I want you to tell me what your birth date is. <a id="link-187" style="display:none;" href="#187">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-188').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-188').show()" id="188" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That is the type of request that can come in from a verifier and then the holder can then go like okay I&apos;ve got 3 of these signatures on here ecdsa SD and BBs they&apos;re asking me for either the the thing in purple or the thing in green so that either the the the ecdsa proof or the ecdsa SD proof and the holder software the digital wallet is like I&apos;m gonna optimize for the holder&apos;s Privacy so I&apos;m going to use ecdsa SD um and they&apos;re only asking for the birthday so I&apos;m only going to disclose the birthday uh to them so that&apos;s an example of like what you know the verifier can ask for and how the holder can respond. <a id="link-188" style="display:none;" href="#188">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-189').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-189').show()" id="189" class="comment"><span class="name">Patrick St-Louis</span>:  And do do you sort of verify your negotiation we&apos;re talking about is there currently a somewhat specific way to do this because pedal signature are fairly new is there currently like a presentation request format specifically addressing like which type of proofs to include. <a id="link-189" style="display:none;" href="#189">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-191').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-191').show()" id="191" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah it&apos;s in the VP request spec um so in in here there&apos;s uh uh their examples of how you like requests um I think maybe and did authentication like um here it has accepted methods but it also can have accepted uh cryptography Suites see like. <a id="link-191" style="display:none;" href="#191">✪</a></div>
