<harrison_tang> hey Gail, thanks for taking the time to join our 
  meeting
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Mike Prorock:

Mike Prorock:  Hello all and welcome to the April 25th 2023 
  Community credentials group meeting so today we are pleased to 
  have Gail Hodges and some others join us from the open ID 
  foundation and get a nice overview of the foundation there as 
  well as kind of crossover since there's a lot of fun stuff going 
  back and forth with work either incubated in this group or that 
  has moved on from this group from incubation and.
Mike Prorock:   We personally use it along on our side.
Mike Prorock: https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/
Mike Prorock:  As well as some others so I thought it would be a 
  very good time to get that overview and especially as the BC to 
  100 working group kind of marches forward and we're starting to 
  look at more exchange verifiable credentials and different 
  mechanisms and what not just a quick reminder that this meeting 
  along with all meetings at the w3c are covered under the code of 
  ethics and professional conduct which I have the link in the chat 
  basically be kind to one another.
Mike Prorock:   Another and make sure everyone has time and all 
  that kind of fun stuff.
Mike Prorock: https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/join
Mike Prorock:  Is totally open to the public and anyone can 
  participate in these calls but if you are contributing to a work 
  item in the ccg you must be a member of the ccg and that is 
  primarily for intellectual property rights reason so if you need 
  to join with the link in the chat there these meetings as per 
  always are posted up on our GitHub and are readily available we 
  do use the chat.
Mike Prorock:   As well as the raised hand okay.
<mprorock> “q+” to add yourself to the queue, with an optional
Mike Prorock:  Molitor back you and I as the moderator will be 
  monitoring that Q so I'm putting a quick text note from the 
  meeting invite but basically you can type Q Plus Q the letter Q 
  followed by the plus symbol into the chat and that will lock put 
  you on the Queue and there's some other notes there quick pause 
  for two items first as intros and Ranchos the second is 
  announcements and reminders but.
Mike Prorock:   First off is there anyone new to this group.
Mike Prorock:  Has not been here before that like to introduce 
  themselves or who has changed roles and would like to introduce 
  themselves as a part of their illegal.
Mike Prorock:  Seeing and hearing none I will move onto any 
  announcements and reminders any relevant announcements for the 
  community and kalea take it away.
Kaliya Young:  Hi I'll just say we had a fabulous internet 
  identity workshop last week and we're working really hard on 
  getting notes in but the announcement the announcement I have is 
  the digital identity unconference Europe is coming up in Zurich a 
  prime not April to June 7 to 9 I'll put a link in and we're 
  having two full days of open space technology.
Kaliya Young:   The method that we use it.
Kaliya Young:  You and it should be really good opportunity for 
  folks in Europe to get together and talk about all things digital 
  identity and hopefully be a forum for all the eei to us and you 
  digital wallet folks to talk amongst themselves.
Kaliya Young: http://www.diceurope.org
Mike Prorock:  Excellent thanks so much and yeah that's really 
  good timing with all the active work going on all day Otis and 
  you know related standards around you know credentialing and 
  exchange of credentialing ranging from the personal sign on out 
  so thanks so much for arranging that.
Mike Prorock:   Any other announcements.
Mike Prorock:  All right cool well with that Gail I'm going to 
  hand it over to you as OnPoint to intro the community or re intro 
  the community to the open ID foundation and get us a nice little 
  fun little overview here and we'll go from there so.
Gail_Hodges: Sounds good sounds great and time check how much 
  time did you want to.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah you've got some flexibility there I would say 
  let's shoot for 30 minutes and then kind of pause for Q&A at that 
  point and then we can go from there so.
Gail_Hodges: Sounds great and I have a couple of members of the 
  foundation to I don't think our regular w3c participants on with 
  me so Mark Haines Torsen modest at I think Christina you sudha is 
  often in these conversations that I don't see comment so I think 
  some of you levels of familiarity with our work what I wanted to 
  do was kick us off the just like two pages of overview on the 
  foundation little bit on what.
Gail_Hodges:  in the area of identity or digital identity.
Gail_Hodges: I have a little bit of a lens on the US market 
  although you know they're extrapolations for the rest of the 
  world and then hopefully between Torsten Christina and Mark will 
  talk about a couple of the pages on oid C4 verifiable credentials 
  which I think has particular relevance torso and Christina this 
  is building on your Workshop presentation from last week that we 
  share publicly last Monday and I popped in a diagram that you 
  usually use and so we've got 45 pages there.
Gail_Hodges:  but I think that's probably one of the Richer parts 
  of the conversation when I do the intro upfront I will.
Gail_Hodges: Our standards and white paper work that's happening 
  within the foundation definitely want to draw that to your 
  attention before we close one of the papers that comment period 
  just concluded but another paper is about to open up for public 
  comment on May 2nd and other paper shortly after that so we 
  definitely want to encourage this stakeholder group to provide 
  your expertise as part of those those Journeys so with that I 
  also had background papers so if we want to jump deeper.
Gail_Hodges:  to gain or some of these other.
Gail_Hodges: Got the material for that as well Maria I'm going to 
  try and push through the document.
Gail_Hodges: Let's see if I've Got The Power sharing my screen 
  wow.
Mike Prorock:  You are up so so yep looking good so far at least 
  oh my God.
Gail_Hodges: Okay I'm going to keep the tracker on the side let 
  me know if this is coming across is too small for all of you the 
  big picture thanks Mike so what is the open ID Foundation we are 
  nonprofit identity Open Standards body we revised our vision and 
  our mission last year our vision is to help people start their 
  identity wherever they choose and our mission is to lead the 
  global community and creating identities centers at secure 
  interoperable and privacy-preserving.
Gail_Hodges:  so I think we're although these are ambitious 
  vision and missions they are also.
Gail_Hodges: To be us playing our natural role amongst a very 
  Complex Community of nonprofit and third party actors so we just 
  want to make sure we're playing our role and we're helping to 
  engage with other thought leaders like like your community our 
  board is comprised of some obviously bring name recognition 
  Britain well-known organizations you might not be familiar with 
  Chicago advisory Partners but they're basically representing the 
  Central Bank of Brazil.
Gail_Hodges:  because of our work in open Banking and open data.
Gail_Hodges: First we have across our full membership of hundreds 
  of entities that includes government stakeholders nonprofit 
  partners and individuals as well so we are it's only to cost $50 
  to be a member of the foundation and how full voting rights and 
  you can contribute to the foundation standards at no cost just by 
  signing a participation agreement so that's important to the DNA 
  of our organization not only for our standards to the openly 
  available but also for their to be the lowest possible 
  conceivable barrier to participation.
Gail_Hodges:  ation and still ensure that there's a safe space 
  for any contributions the legal protection and.
Gail_Hodges: We do have billions of users using our respective 
  standards most of you would be most familiar with with open ID 
  connect and you know the use cases for login or Enterprise access 
  there were also one of the leading standards for open Banking and 
  open data which drives a lot of our government relationships and 
  talk very briefly about that open Health as well many of our 
  students have been selected by the Health Community in the UK 
  Norway and here in the US for digital identity where I'll spend.
Gail_Hodges:  little bit more time.
Gail_Hodges: People spend more time on that and shared signals so 
  if you're creating any sort of network how do you you know share 
  signals between the entities within that community in terms of 
  government Partnerships we work very closely with numerous 
  different countries around the world here are a handful of them 
  you can see in the u.s. context bunch of acronyms but nist for 
  standard CHS Department Homeland Security Consumer Finance 
  protection board is the open Banking and open data space fincen 
  and Treasury.
Gail_Hodges:  the White House and others the open key European 
  Commission.
Gail_Hodges: You kill you.
Gail_Hodges: The EU digital identity wallet where they selected 
  some of our open ID for verifiable credential standards in their 
  recent architectural reference framework will talk to that later 
  today I could have mentioned the California DMV they've also 
  selected some of our standards and for use in a similar 
  architecture to the EU the UK the open banking implementation 
  entity that's open banking up and data and the other three are 
  also open Banking and open data Focus so Australia consumer data 
  rights and a triple C's their consumer protection group Brazil.
Gail_Hodges:  the central bank and open banking Brazil and the 
  same Canada so we've got a lot of a lot of direct engagement and 
  for many of those open Banking and open.
Gail_Hodges: Like the standards but they're also choosing to use 
  our certification capabilities which are basically 
  self-certification at a super low price point so trying to make 
  it as accessible as possible for participants in the ecosystem to 
  confirm that their implementations are aligned in conformance to 
  the standards and it usually runs between about a thousand to 
  five thousand dollars per implementation which is I think 
  substantially lower than one would see for commercial 
  certification programs.
Gail_Hodges:  in terms of the this is what the the Strategic task 
  force has been.
Gail_Hodges: Chanting our Focus for this year there's a few 
  administrative items in here but I'll start on the actually the 
  right side of the Stitch the page so those standards and those 
  initiatives which already have internet scale so open ID connect 
  our open banking open data work which is the factory standard or 
  security profile I should say and our certification program so 
  those are quite mature quite robust and are really in continuing 
  to grow then in terms of crossing the chasm you know those 
  standards that are emerging but really moving rapidly up the 
  adoption curve we have open eyes.
Gail_Hodges:  reconnect for verifiable credentials open ID 
  connect for identity assurance and shared signals framework we're 
  kind of.
Gail_Hodges: In the foundations.
Gail_Hodges: And this is where we kind of mix things up a little 
  bit next generation is making sure we're really bringing in 
  thought leadership from the Next Generation whether in Academia 
  or young professionals kind of coming into this domain space the 
  gain work of the global assured identity Network were the home of 
  the proof of concept so although that community group is 
  self-organizing we offer our IP are in our legal entity to help 
  that group deliver on its objectives of interoperability of 
  identity data across.
Gail_Hodges:  some jurisdictions and in.
Gail_Hodges: And we're also an active participant what on what's 
  nicknamed the G6 for the gain initiative stakeholders which is 
  six nonprofits who are helping to steer The Wider gain project 
  and I got of is a profile of open ID connect particularly 
  relevant for government implementations moderna is a version of 
  the open ID profile specific for mobile mobile networks and then 
  during the plan so we have as the open ID Foundation.
Gail_Hodges:  the open wallet.
Gail_Hodges: Founding nonprofits we have a couple of key white 
  papers one on government and identity what an another on 
  government-issued identity credentials and the Privacy 
  implications those are both racing towards their final versions 
  now the Privacy white paper just closed its comment period 
  yesterday on the 24th and the government white paper that Mark 
  Haines on this call and Elizabeth Garber or co-leading that paper 
  will will open for public comment on the night on the made 
  second.
Gail_Hodges:  and through May 12 so that will come shortly and in 
  both of those.
Gail_Hodges: Have been more than six nonprofits Who provided 
  their expertise as well as interviews over six months as well as 
  public listening sessions that iiw authenticate open ID 
  Foundation workshops and various other forms to really try and 
  have a global perspective on the movement that's underway right 
  now we also have a paper on iot and identity which is currently 
  going to be a report to the board and potentially made public 
  shortly at a Denver's and that's looking at clearly the 
  interfaces between those domains between the things as well as.
Gail_Hodges:  the carbon people we have a new technical 
  Ambassador we brought on board that is a mark Haines so that's a 
  great for the foundation to have his.
Gail_Hodges: The core team will be varying on a market direct 
  marketing director if some of you have ideas please let me know 
  and we're improving you know we're looking to make sure that our 
  well form specification process is clearly articulated and we're 
  updating our website at the same time so we're kind of making 
  sure that are prophecies for specification is made public we also 
  have some work on health that we've done last year and then 
  there's some emerging areas around AI web 30 there's a lot of 
  discussion as well I'm going to make sure we're keeping keeping 
  on the pulse.
Gail_Hodges:  of of that domain space as well we also recognize 
  the importance of diversity so what are you know efforts we can 
  do to support.
Gail_Hodges: Community as a whole and supporting end developers 
  write the ones who are really putting this to work so this is how 
  we kind of think about you know different have a bunch of 
  different initiatives to try and deliver both the specifications 
  as well as make sure that that work is accessible and supporting 
  the community as a whole I'm going to jump onto the next page 
  I've lost my cursor there it is which is just a little bit of 
  gales take really on the u.s. model and one way of looking at it 
  as different flavors.
Gail_Hodges:  and this is a page I've shared with you know some 
  US government officials in the past which they found a little bit 
  you.
Gail_Hodges: To orient themselves on some of the different 
  options that are out there and how we fit in and how some of the 
  other US Government efforts fit in so the three kind of different 
  categories I think about things is you might have a government 
  issue credential that is government issue right it's may be 
  derived from the created based on digital version of the physical 
  driving license or ID there are a couple of leading standards at 
  least in the u.s. context in person you know moving to online 
  that the started as the impersonal.
Gail_Hodges:  varmint it's moving online you have that kind of 
  government root of trust or confidence the.
Gail_Hodges: It supports that.
Gail_Hodges: Provisioning and you have the option to link to 
  other types of government claims and credential types pretty cool 
  and then you have two flavors of privately issued credentials so 
  you might have privately issue credentials that are derived using 
  a government Source like a DL DB from Amba or another direct 
  access to a state or a federal system of record and then you 
  might have privately issued credentials and Services I say some 
  of this with trepidation because I know some of you would 
  probably react it strongly the different words on the page but.
Gail_Hodges:  trying to trying to simplify it then for DHS and 
  TSA there's been some guidance.
Gail_Hodges: Is a checkpoint so the first two categories a 
  government-issued or privately issued with a government Source 
  could be adapted to be conformant so a user can present that 
  credential at a TSA checkpoint to travel then for Miss the 863 
  Ash for digital identity guidance is looking I think to cover all 
  three of those spectrums to help ensure that government entities 
  would be able to consume digital identity information and apply 
  appropriate levels of a assurance and interpret.
Gail_Hodges:  at their risk profile their risk profile 
  appropriately and then.
Gail_Hodges: Perspective we have a little bit of a foot in the 
  game and all of those domains right so we see some of it 
  depending on our standards depending on the application some of 
  our specs can can help support those implementations help 
  underpin them so we sit across quite a few different spaces at 
  this point Christina and Torsten thought I'd point to you as you 
  can see I've got a couple of pages on what we shared last week as 
  well as the diagram are you comfortable picking up and taking a 
  few of these pages to share.
Kristina: I'm not go ahead.
Gail_Hodges: Yep this is the formatting is still not quite right 
  is it Torsten think it's might be hiding a little coffee.
<kristina> so presenting any credential format over BLE
<kristina> (not just mdocs :P)
https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-4-vc-security-and-trust-1_0.html
<kristina> this document is essentialy a trust/security analysis 
  for the entire issuer-holder-verifier model
Mike Prorock:  Not yet at this time and I'll jump in if we 
  something pops up I'm watching the key from so.
Gail_Hodges: Want to talk about before.
Gail_Hodges: Would you like to go next.
Gail_Hodges: Houston apologies thank you.
Gail_Hodges: That's what I was going to do.
Gail_Hodges: Great happy to see if anyone in the ccg has has 
  additional questions feel free to pop them in the chat and Mike 
  you can help us pull them out since I can't see the chat while 
  presenting hopefully everyone will take the moment to snap the 
  picture and if you remember to please vote so we can keep that 
  work moving along particularly in support of the EU California 
  and New South Wales all of which you have selected this standard 
  as Government partners and of course many private players have 
  also been working.
Gail_Hodges:  and selected the standard so exciting times thank 
  you for sitting.
Gail_Hodges: Let's move on maybe Mark you can just share a few 
  headlines I think you briefed this group recently on EK R IC and 
  idea working group which is the open ID connect for identity 
  Assurance standard you also have a spec open for voting so we can 
  oops sorry jumping around a little bit.
Gail_Hodges:  there you go maybe you can give up.
Gail_Hodges: You the headlines mark this is also the content you 
  shared with the workshop last.
<kristina> openid.net/oid4vc is a go-to place for anything OID4VC
<kristina> there are quite some OSS libraries emerging
<kristina> and information on adoption like 18 compliant wallets 
  in EBSI :_
<kristina> :)
<kristina> and here is BLE draft (if anyone has expertise) 
  https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-over-ble-1_0.html
Gail_Hodges: We have the working group progress challenges and 
  then really the roadmap but I think you also are trying to lean 
  into protocol agnostic approach here right so despite the maybe 
  you can talk about that.
<harrison_tang> the http://openid.net/oid4vc link goes to "404 
  Not Found"
Gail_Hodges: We could do a Segway knocks I know time is tight and 
  Mark all I'll tap you too kind of Riff a little bit on the open 
  ID government sorry the young the white paper which although this 
  is branded open ID has actually had more than five different 
  nonprofit entities and a swath of experts from around the world 
  contributing to it I'll do the intro Mark and then I'll ask you 
  to talk about the country mapping and the in the key principles 
  and recommendations.
Gail_Hodges:  since Elizabeth's not here I'll pretend I'm her.
<mprorock> this should work: https://openid.net/openid4vc/
Gail_Hodges: One of the objectives of the white paper you know 
  was to make sure that it was grounded in the Universal 
  Declaration of Human Rights and and that that was a starting 
  point regardless of the jurisdiction around the world that you 
  were thinking about digital identity that was a crucial you know 
  starting point and then the co-authors have been doing rigorous 
  review of all of the literature that's available most recently 
  the oecd published draft recommendations on the governments of 
  governance of digital identity infrastructure and so to really 
  try and build.
Gail_Hodges:  build upon.
Gail_Hodges: Do you know due diligence that's been established 
  and to try and consolidate that into view of the landscape and 
  what are sensible recommendations for government officials that 
  are looking to kind of go through this journey Mark maybe you can 
  talk a little bit about the plotting here and then I'll go to 
  page 41 which is the recommendations.
Gail_Hodges: Sharing quite a bunch of them and that's where the 
  rest of the pages went right Mark.
Gail_Hodges:  it was kind of like trying to.
Gail_Hodges: IW some feedback from the community you know it was 
  great to have 20 30 people in the room you know to provide their 
  perspective and help enrich you know how far down should we go in 
  terms of guidance knowing that its Global guidance and you can't 
  take the value system of just one jurisdiction and apply it to 
  others you know it needs to really work and build upon you know 
  how you deliver on the oecd principles right Mark and so if you'd 
  be great to get this community's feedback coming in you know when 
  it goes goes public.
Mike Prorock:  I think so yeah I'm not seeing anyone on the cube 
  but right now is a great time or there any kind of questions from 
  the community I know there's been a lot of back and forth we'll 
  do a DC and I know a lot of times.
Mike Prorock:   There's almost.
Gail_Hodges: And I think Mike Pro rock that probably brings us to 
  a pause you know to see if there's any other questions we area 
  this.
Mike Prorock:  This dichotomy that will get built up that will 
  say oh yeah well we just deal with human side or looking at one 
  particular method or were working just as through the system and 
  there are api-related but not clearly low a TCP flows across a 
  lot of these different items so any any questions in from the 
  community here and if not I definitely have a question maybe I'll 
  start there which it is I obviously.
Mike Prorock:   Not saying anyone hopping on the queue.
Mike Prorock:  For my own edification obviously open data comes 
  up a lot in the context of open ID as probation but it seems to 
  be still mostly focused around banking all right and that kind of 
  information there any you know given the amount of emphasis going 
  on on open data in other areas and things like that I mean is 
  there a plan to expand out but you know put broader engagement in 
  place or are there things going on that just.
Mike Prorock:   Not really visible or accessible from the website 
  that folks should be thinking of.
Mike Prorock:  I'm thinking especially because of things that the 
  traceability vocab and then other efforts like we take day job 
  wise around things like agricultural data and Health Data and 
  things like that.
Gail_Hodges: Yeah I'm happy to Riff on that a little bit Mike so 
  you're quite right that a lot of the orientation around open and 
  open data has really started in.
Gail_Hodges:  banking but it.
Gail_Hodges: It really is moving across vertical at least that's 
  you know what we see clearly for Open Health that's one of the 
  the key drivers of the that tends to be different different 
  stakeholders who are driving the thinking and Open Health we do 
  see whether it's Australia or Brazil like Brazil has gone from 
  open banking into open insurance so that's a half step we're 
  seeing in Australia the movement going into utilities and Telecom 
  and and so forth so it's really consumer data rights is the way 
  that a market like Australia is approaching it so it kind of is.
Gail_Hodges:  depends on where it's originating if you're here in 
  the US clearly it's really a focus on banking at the moment with.
Gail_Hodges: Cfpb that's underway this calendar year with clear 
  commitments to make that happen the same thing in Canada right so 
  focus on open banking but I think that we're likely to see you 
  know more and more movement into the consider data right 
  perspective and from our perspective it's it's protocol agnostic 
  right so the factory security profile would work across different 
  verticals it really doesn't matter what you're putting through 
  that secure plate it could be different types of.
Gail_Hodges:  data data structures different verticals so if you 
  like I could.
Gail_Hodges: Couple of couple of.
Gail_Hodges: Does update on where that work is globally because 
  you got a little bit in here in terms of the different countries 
  but I think I'll actually pause presenting and bring up a 
  different page to talk about the multiple different countries 
  that are like what we're actually doing with that let me pause 
  this presentation and see if there's any questions along the way.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah I guess we related to that you know thinking 
  about the Open Health stuff like that I mean one of the areas we 
  deal with is monitoring disease reporting globally right in that 
  and that's from a one Health expect it's not just human but also 
  animal livestock Etc and that's an area where despite a lot of 
  efforts especially only Agriculture and invasive species stuff 
  there is still no defined you know like scheming format so caps 
  Etc that are actually.
Mike Prorock:   Liam use all that and so on.
Mike Prorock:  Area you see your members actually participating 
  actively almond actually getting buy-in on or is that just an 
  area that as it moves off for this reasons a certain care 
  improved over time things like that.
Gail_Hodges: So I haven't heard about the agricultural use case 
  in movement yet I'd be intrigued Mike to chat with you offline 
  see what you're hearing so you've been close to that supply chain 
  you know conversation with you know John on and DHS but if it's 
  kind of starting to kind of cascade into agriculture I think 
  that's it.
Gail_Hodges: Aware that's perking up because it can be a 
  crossover between the government issued credentials as well as 
  the open open data domain as well as potentially also iot as 
  you're thinking about how is our gating some of the movement of 
  goods I think there's a interesting Confluence there.
Mike Prorock:  Okay yeah it's helpful that I might do a little 
  digging around on that so you know thank you Margaret okay 
  perfect awesome.
Gail_Hodges: So I'll try and do this in the two-minute version so 
  we can obviously share this deck out or ask any of you know 
  respond to any specific questions but fappy you know is looking 
  on developing the security profile to move the you know the data 
  on the consent-based way between the users and the other 
  ecosystem participants sometimes it's called Data free floods 
  with trust sometimes it's called a bin Banking and open data it's 
  got a lot of names but it's really the same underlying objective.
Gail_Hodges:  of and the The Faculty framework security.
<mprorock> /me sees Sandy
Gail_Hodges: The cover like all the key aspects and as we 
  mentioned for the iadc for VC work it's so important to have the 
  security analysis across the you know the protocol end to end and 
  that's important work which both fact you want and now fact he to 
  have been through the security analysis also with the University 
  of Stuttgart so very exciting work and Fabby to is moving to 
  final in the days and months ahead in terms of countries it's 
  very you know wide partnership and engagement which is what I 
  had.
Gail_Hodges:  alluded to at the beginning so whether that's the 
  UK with the OB I obiee and that's mostly open banking but I think 
  they're looking to extend.
<sandy_aggarwal> How does Microsoft Entra link up with the OIDF? 
  I'm specifically interested in their XBox  and Mesh ecosystems.
Gail_Hodges: And Finance in Brazil for open Insurance they've 
  selected the standard they've also mandated the conformance on 
  both sides of the transaction for the 00 PCR open ID providers as 
  well as the relying parties which is really exciting they often 
  you know Brazil also decide to become a board member which is 
  which is great to make sure that they're taking part of the 
  global conversation we also know that this work is cascading 
  around Latin America with Chile Colombia and Mexico expected to 
  be next and other countries are very much you know passing 
  legislation and moving at the same.
Gail_Hodges: Both moving on open Banking and open data the 
  consumer data rights work they've also selected the the standards 
  of the foundation and are also contemplating using the 
  certification capabilities to build on what they already have 
  Saudi Arabia has selected the standards and I was also 
  collaborating with us and certification can and Canada is going 
  through their kind of rulemaking and their refinement process as 
  we speak and there I think she feels likely that they'll continue 
  to.
Gail_Hodges:  I want to work with the fat be security profile and 
  figure out you know what that means for the.
Gail_Hodges: Leanne implementations same thing here in the US 
  we've been formally briefing the cfpb and commenting on their 
  their rulemaking and I think they're trying to work out what good 
  looks like here and then Norway has selected this standard for 
  health so it's kind of sitting across the piece and about those 
  from UK to Saudi Arabia they've all chosen to use the foundation 
  certification support the others either don't think they pretty 
  much don't have certification of the moments about.
Mike Prorock:  Right yeah now makes total sense and I run it 
  running a bit of change track I see a question in from Sandy here 
  so Sandy far away.
Sandy_Aggarwal: Am I I know if my mind okay basically my 
  understand that Microsoft has been working in close collaboration 
  here on sure maybe Christina could answer session but his working 
  in operation with the or IDF principles that certifications.
Sandy_Aggarwal: Well I'm sorry good Mike.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah you just said because I know you were having 
  some Mike break up there at least on my side but looking back to 
  the question I think also the overlap between Entre and oid see 
  and like how closely are these things related from both an 
  implementation I'm not sure necessarily on the certification so 
  I'd say India that been in there as well.
Gail_Hodges: So is the question whether Microsoft implementations 
  are certified well.
Kristina: I mean bought online Microsoft is only one company 
  implementing a standard standardized in open idea Foundation 
  nothing last nothing more.
Kristina: When they certification comes out Microsoft to be tried 
  to be surprised just like any other entity feed government or 
  private entity will try to be certify it that's it nothing 
  special.
Gail_Hodges: Any other questions that I'll drop this off the page 
  here stop presenting.
Gail_Hodges: You know great.
Mike Prorock:  Sounds good and if you have if you have shareable 
  versions of these two presentations it'd be great if you could 
  drop them on the mailing list after this just the folks can 
  reference if they need to and if not we can always roll back over 
  recording but it's nice if we could you know point to 
  presentation should begin to reference it any other questions on 
  the queue for Gail Mark and team on and Torsten Etc on the 
  Odyssey.
Mike Prorock:   See open up the foundation side effects.
<gail_hodges> gail.hodges@oidf.org
Gail_Hodges: Great well maybe I can just put in the chat my 
  contact information in case anyone has follow-up the questions 
  and delighted to have the opportunity to share some of our work 
  with you and looking forward to further collaboration.
Mike Prorock:  Excellent yeah thanks so much again and really 
  appreciate the time we did want to serve okey 0q here.
Mike Prorock:  Our was that a clap and hit the hands up cool yep 
  the cheers did want to reserve a few minutes at the end here 
  since we just rolled out iiw just obit for kind of for open q of 
  any thoughts Impressions feedback items to take note of for the 
  community that may be evolving on iwi last week so I'm going to 
  oh just open the queue and monitor at this point.
Mike Prorock:  Clio far away.
Kaliya Young:  I mean I think something that was interesting but 
  that we saw six different sections that had a i in them I'm in 
  one of them I haven't I didn't go to any of the other ones but 
  I'm hoping to sort of actually think it would be interesting to 
  have a community call where and I was subject and people talked 
  about it maybe I don't know so thought.
Mike Prorock:  That is an excellent thought from at least selfish 
  perspective as someone who's been working in machine learning for 
  very you know or what ended up getting called machine learning to 
  most of my career so I am happy to work with the chairs to 
  schedule that if there are others interested in that topic feel 
  free to definitely fire a thread onto the list and or email 
  myself but you know on the other chairs directly if that's a 
  topic of Interest I think there are a lot of intersection points.
Mike Prorock:   With what we're calling a i at the minimum.
Mike Prorock:  Things like taking plain text and converting it 
  into credentials there's a lot of credential applications around 
  sources of training data and things like that as well Joe as he 
  will.
Phil Long: +1 To Kaliya's suggestion re: AI. There were more than 
  a dozen at the last ASU/GSV re: AI/conversational bots etc.
Joe Andrieu:  Yeah I actually jumped I liked you before Clea 
  started talking but I totally agree with her I think part of what 
  was interesting for me about a i w-was it does seem to be the 
  seed.
Joe Andrieu:   Out of a hole.
Joe Andrieu:  New sort of application of identity and what the 
  overlap is there or how they help or hinder each other is a huge 
  open issue from fraudulent identities right deep fakes to how can 
  you use decentralized identifiers to participate in a public 
  Commons where the data that builds these foundational models are 
  a shared asset and we have attribution based on using deads.
Mike Prorock: +1 Misinformation is a big topic - as is Verified 
  Information Environments
Joe Andrieu:   So all sorts of innovative thoughts and ideas.
Joe Andrieu:  Young but I think it's going to be a hotbed of 
  innovation I would love to have a meeting here.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah no thanks for that Joe and I that's something 
  we touch on for sure on our side with like a National Science 
  Foundation I know matter as is what passed Marcus e1q.
<mprorock> @gail muted you for feedback reasons - sorry
Mike Prorock:  Yes exactly there's a lot there it's for sure I 
  think we'll definitely has chairs you know take that as a note 
  and try to slot something in obviously we have some of us who 
  worked very directly in that field as members of this community 
  and at least myself I'm connected to a number outside Community 
  also work on this and I think there's overlap with other w3c I 
  select the web machine learning.
Mike Prorock:   Group and things like that for the supplies as 
  well.
<gail_hodges> As I mentioned at the AI + Identity session that 
  Dmitri co-hosted at IIW, the OIDF Board requested a report on the 
  intersection of AI+Identity- so I have asked community for who is 
  interested and who has AI development expertise that might want 
  to contribute. Personally I'd like to make it public over time, 
  and I know gov stakeholders are interested in the issues and 
  opportunities.
Mike Prorock:  So it's definitely topic we're seeing more of.
Mike Prorock:  Anyone else on the cube to close out here and 
  otherwise will end.
Mike Prorock:  Second gear just got a nice little bit here Gail 
  you're up.
Mike Prorock:  I did meet you see may have to unmute because you 
  were feedback yeah.
Gail_Hodges: Yeah I just yeah yeah so I just put it into the chat 
  and and shared last week in one of those sessions that Kalia 
  mentioned the one that Dimitri co-hosted from MIT that the open 
  ID Foundation board had asked for a report and have worked out 
  exactly how to create such a report on that the intersection of 
  AI and identity but to get you know a read of the landscape and 
  potentially start nudging.
Gail_Hodges:  into the areas of.
Gail_Hodges: Unity and I'm sure some of you are hearing you know 
  a lot of questions from government stakeholders as well as coolie 
  private individuals who are quite quite concerned about this 
  space so I'm certainly trying to work out optimal ways to 
  synthesize it so if you have expertise in this space please do 
  let me know.
<harrison_tang> Here is the latest calendar:  
  https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/credentials/calendar.  We will work 
  on putting AI & Identity topics into our meetings in the second 
  half of the year.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah yeah Gail if you want to just connect me and 
  I mean obviously I can get up with Dimitri but if you want to get 
  a little email thread going with myself for sure we have definite 
  overlap with a number of our customer to open the 
  commercialization the government space and there's a lot of 
  overlap between skirts almost done so.
Mike Prorock:  Excellent well cool with that I'm just going to 
  say Happy Tuesday to everyone please enjoy the rest of your day 
  really shape the time from Gabe Mark and forcing everyone hopping 
  on and Christina obviously as always and with that I'm going to 
  stop recording at you will talk again next week so I won't.
Mike Prorock:  All right man we'll see you I'm just booting 
  people so I can close it out.
Harrison_Tang: Hashirama and I think yeah we can talk offline 
  about how do we schedule those Ai and identity topics like.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah and I'm almost wondering let me stop 
  transcription here.
