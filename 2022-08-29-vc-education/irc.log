[2022-08-29T15:14:55.417Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: We could make identity less binary or like one-dimensional centralized thing but rather make it you know a function of of like a network of Records or function of like multiple records so say if you are I don't know like if you have a credential that you have a degree in in Psychiatry and you are based in this or that country and you know you've participated and this or that Community only then.\
[2022-08-29T15:14:56.193Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Do you get voting rights in our.\

[2022-08-29T15:15:04.389Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Could I take funding program around psychiatric research or whatsoever so.\
[2022-08-29T15:15:37.414Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: The architecture with which you build passport and I'll talk about it is it's basically agnostic to like how you want to score identities but the the you know use case that we are actively exploring our like personal proofs like just verifying the unique Humanity of participants and then plurality through like recognizing the the social cultural backgrounds of participants and then increasing like rewards for cooperation across these differences.\
[2022-08-29T15:15:37.735Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  and here's kind of like a.\
[2022-08-29T15:15:41.349Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: The view of the hmm.\
[2022-08-29T15:16:12.825Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Yeah architecture of the passport so basically the passport itself is like it data structure on the ceramic Network which is basically like a publicly readable data storage and then in our case people manage their part of that big database through the did pkh method so basically like you use your etherium wallet and in our case.\
[2022-08-29T15:16:13.148Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  case like we take these here.\
[2022-08-29T15:16:45.668Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Cancer people use a theorem accounts to to manage their passports on the ceramic Network and at the same time we map the theorem accounts to the IDS through the did pkh method and basically you know we take personal data whether that's like coming from public blockchains or coming from web to platforms organization so you know blockchains cases it might be you know data around you know what decentralized autonomous organizations you have.\
[2022-08-29T15:16:45.975Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  participated in or.\
[2022-08-29T15:17:03.945Z]	<Matthias_Gottlieb_(TUM)>	present+\
[2022-08-29T15:17:17.651Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: What's all bonds tokens you hold in web Platforms in might be you know you're followings on Twitter or like the amount of followers that you have and you know organizations like universities obviously could you know issue verify credentials to their students so basically we basically take data and wrap it and verify be credentialed and map them to the passport or to the passport of a passport holder right.\
[2022-08-29T15:17:18.045Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  and then as a passport holder.\
[2022-08-29T15:17:40.063Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Go to digital applications like it can grants to get voting weights or you know you could I don't know go to a university to get access to the digital library I suppose you know or whatever you know you might need a verify about people so.\
[2022-08-29T15:17:56.028Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Cool thing is the whole passport project is open source and with that like free of charge we have an interface that we run so basically an interface for like this.\
[2022-08-29T15:18:26.101Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Passport management from like a passport holder perspective where they can claim a set of five credentials that we have curated that will then score on good corn Grant side but you know similarily like you could build an independent front end and you know issue of 05 credentialed say in the educational realm and then scored in whatever way you want to scored using the same infrastructure.\
[2022-08-29T15:18:26.515Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  we could also and this is.\
[2022-08-29T15:18:59.450Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Lovely exploring now like just arrived another piece of background is like we launched the passport this summer so it's like pretty much an alpha Mode still but we are also working on making our front end for these dids very much compatible with very various use cases so that as a passport holder or person that's in the past what you can like manage a world where you have you know thousands of fiber credentials flowing floating around that were like different credentials would.\
[2022-08-29T15:18:59.872Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  be relevant to different applications so.\
[2022-08-29T15:19:12.862Z]	<Janko>	present+\
[2022-08-29T15:19:26.862Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: In something like hitting a photo okay what credentials do I need for the Harvard University library and then you see the like set of credentials that you need to claim or that you already have and and this way like by use case you can kind of filter the credentials that you need or that you already have but here we also have it like in progress software development kit I'll send the link to this presentation actually.\
[2022-08-29T15:19:31.589Z]	<Leon>	https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JSgWilxV9UftNzI9WIq7Z5MN5v3LtRdXQEHykMVvwGM/edit?usp=sharing\
[2022-08-29T15:19:58.333Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: I said right now so I don't forget yes the Bots will appeared but yeah you can check out the software development kit you can also check out this beginner's guide for developers so someone in our community made basically as you know other projects will come in you know more decentralized applications or just.\
[2022-08-29T15:20:09.967Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Apologies for the crypto slang here you know we'll probably add more users who you know get utility through passports and then.\
[2022-08-29T15:20:42.200Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: As more users of their like we'll probably they'll also add more stamps like more data to their passports and that will give even more utility to other applications right because you kind of develop this network effect around around the passport and this way you know basically more apps means more user means one stands guess you get the idea so currently in the last grandson like we run these Grant programs on a quarterly basis because.\
[2022-08-29T15:20:42.667Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  you know we have like capital.\
[2022-08-29T15:21:15.978Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: They like three million dollars and then add one point in time you basically need to take a snapshot of the votes all the donations that came in and distribute these matching funds so we do this on a quarterly basis and then run like two-week-long grants programs the first one where we launched a passport was in July or June where we had about I think it was in June like 12,000 signups to the passport as part of that Alpha implementation and then.\
[2022-08-29T15:21:16.316Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  then in the next grants round will.\
[2022-08-29T15:21:26.496Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: With the Twisted we added a bunch of stamps or like stamps here by the way I mean verify with credentials it's our.\
[2022-08-29T15:21:57.070Z]	<Nate_Otto_(he/him)>	present+\
[2022-08-29T15:21:58.694Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Ecology for like user Minds to communicate the per fiber credentials and and this way I hopefully making the scoring of the passwords more effective in good congrats but also just giving it more utility and at the same time like we've started like partner application program I'll share some links around that later so if you'd be interested in you know experimenting with passport and your community or application.\
[2022-08-29T15:21:59.071Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  you can basically chat.\
[2022-08-29T15:22:06.754Z]	<Andy_Griebel>	present+\
[2022-08-29T15:22:20.759Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: You know you can do it anytime because it's all open source and we have an SDK but if you wanted to do it through our front end on collaboration with us we would benefit because we you know learn from like Partners how we can improve the SDK and how they are thinking about their application and on the other hand.\
[2022-08-29T15:22:54.252Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: As an application developer you would get more Hands-On support from us then just by consuming the SDK so in September will run grandson 15 and then hopefully by the end of September we ship like 226 partner applications from the various conversation so we are in right now and and then yeah moving forward I guess we'll just explore new use cases within geeking grants you know maybe going Beyond Simple quadratic funding we can do more pluralistic quadratic funding.\
[2022-08-29T15:22:54.552Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  I like we use to credentials to.\
[2022-08-29T15:23:22.424Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: It was between the contributors and then re increase a matching funding for projects that receive like support from a diverse Community as opposed to just like a very homogeneous Community you know like in very simple terms imagine that currently you know we really ignore these relationships right so I have a grant like a project gets many donations from say only people from the theorem ecosystem.\
[2022-08-29T15:23:22.782Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  you know that.\
[2022-08-29T15:23:55.978Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Kinda and you could chamber of just a theorem ecosystem supporters right but imagine that that we had credentials that kinda would allow us to map these contributors onto a social graph so basically we could see that and maybe mute you know support from homogeneous groups like that obviously it's not that's like simple that it's you know if you remember or Bitcoin or whatever crypto Rick system is the only groups who would consider but you know ideally we could.\
[2022-08-29T15:23:56.421Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  actually then increase matching for projects that have support.\
[2022-08-29T15:24:20.490Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Like explicitly the Bitcoin Community is a theorem community members also the verifiable credential Community if we could add another like dimension of diversity to it and maybe check like at which universities these students have studied because obviously like as a I don't know Brown University graduate much more likely.\
[2022-08-29T15:24:20.741Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  I guess.\
[2022-08-29T15:24:53.381Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: To project from a brown student right or like someone in that works in that Brown University spirit so I basically looking at the social context of these credentials we can use that to like promote diversity I think that's one of the like use case we could explore also like just membership right like to participate in this voting program or whatever you need to be a member of this or that community and the credentials could be.\
[2022-08-29T15:24:53.805Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  approved for that you can check out the.\
[2022-08-29T15:25:27.248Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Face of passport here just as an out we are like the grandson 15 starts on September 7th and we like currently we have like eight data points in there or like 10 that you can verify so and they're not very meaningful to be honest right it's like just do you have a Facebook account yes an hour Syria we send you through the Facebook or Google account yes or no Twitter account yes or no get up account we don't install the account handles like we create basically in encrypted hashes of.\
[2022-08-29T15:25:27.656Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  of the account handled so if someone shows up with two.\
[2022-08-29T15:26:00.250Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: That contain you know to like it whatever I'm going to respectively say that has the same hash we would know okay it was generated from the account handle but wouldn't know what that account handle is but basically we just have these eight data points and by basically the end of this week it will you'll be able to verify up to 61 data points I think some of which will be sub points of existing identity provider.\
[2022-08-29T15:26:00.674Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  us so in Twitter's case for instance will not only.\

[2022-08-29T15:27:22.239Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Verify credentials with the data structures on ceramic and build your own front end but like we use this backlog to populate the verify credentials said we could use and get congrats but will also show the the list here basically to to these partners that we're working with now to to verify identity and their applications if you two want to like utilize passport to I know verify identity in your dish.\

[2022-08-29T15:31:29.413Z]	<Transcriber>	Kerri_Lemoie: Reading this part of this.\

[2022-08-29T15:33:04.800Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Thing one of one of the keys is that we store this hash ear that allows us to identify whether you know if I would again verify Google stamp with the same Google account that would be the same for example.\
[2022-08-29T15:33:11.027Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Yeah I think they only.\

[2022-08-29T15:33:33.090Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Um of it Renshaw so when when someone comes to the application on our end we could you know identify it as a Google stamp.\
[2022-08-29T15:33:37.003Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: As a Google credential does that make sense.\
[2022-08-29T15:33:51.528Z]	<Transcriber>	Kerri_Lemoie: It does make sense thank you for sharing that so this is what it looks like yeah I'd be happy to email you separately and send you some of the examples they made interest your team to see what those look like too.\

[2022-08-29T15:35:22.141Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: We visited just had to have an account or not but in the next iteration you will basically open to click this and then you open the sidebar and then the other data points that you can opt into is like the amount of followers and like treats that you made but with background like we do this because you know if you have more than 5,000 followers it's like at least bit better evidence that you are a human right and then just having a Twitter account.\
[2022-08-29T15:35:22.539Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon:  but currently we basically.\

[2022-08-29T15:35:47.500Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: It up ons like five or six safe or Twitter we would issue six distinct credentialed to that passport obviously we could also like wrap it all in one and and we are we are basically also trying to figure out like how we split up data into different credentials or like how we you know.\
[2022-08-29T15:35:57.316Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Whether we should issue the credentials like as distinctly as possible if you know what I mean.\

[2022-08-29T15:37:56.165Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya: We have to be really careful about the words we choose to describe the things we're doing to help so that the public perception is more aligned with our reality so anyway that's just a comment I felt I should voice.\
[2022-08-29T15:38:19.093Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Yeah that's helpful thank you yeah I think the the passport branding is not like really set in stone yet it was like so so we could very likely I'm actively explore this with our marketing team that that I kind of leaning leading like all the branding efforts around passport.\
[2022-08-29T15:38:27.113Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: All like around blank.\

I prefer not to live in fear of conspiracy theorists, but it is good to be aware of what detractors are out there, even if they're sometimes woefully mistaken.)\
[2022-08-29T15:39:51.540Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Yeah Kelly I just out of curiosity would you be able to like to share a bit more about this conspiracy theorists and I like that the kind of Miss misconception that like brand like this might likely cause.\
[2022-08-29T15:40:08.947Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya: Sir yeah well I mean there's a woman named Allison McDowell who is she describes herself as a parent in a parent and she has taken upon herself to.\
[2022-08-29T15:40:40.027Z]	<Transcriber>	Kaliya: You know I think there are real legitimate concerns that many of us in the working on verifiable credentials share about potentially very creepy combinations of technology in the future that impact human Freedom so I think we have more in common with the concern side of why this conspiracy theories are being woven and that they're also putting she's stringing dots together that.\

[2022-08-29T15:44:03.644Z]	<Transcriber>	TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Those governments will not be happy for the branding is passport for instance that's it.\

[2022-08-29T15:44:29.231Z]	<Brent>	For "Passport" branding, I think there's a balance between using language that is technically accurate and using language that is approachable for people who are new to identity.\

[2022-08-29T15:47:19.900Z]	<Transcriber>	Leon: Approach Integrations with like this educational certificate generally like is because I'm like not super familiar like at what state you know the educational VC sector is at right now so would you rather approach like University by University or are they are already like kind of meta networks it kind of work with like multiple universities that you could reach out to or.\

[2022-08-29T15:53:23.574Z]	<Transcriber>	Kerri_Lemoie: Building out software to help with signing and verifying and issuing of the credentials but also an open Wallet like a reference software that says here's what a verifiable credential qualit looks like here's how it can work with some of the the protocol standards like DC API and just sort of like help demonstrate how all of this can work with an ecosystem and then for those who are interested to try and help them get them on board.\
