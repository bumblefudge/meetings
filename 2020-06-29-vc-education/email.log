Topic: US Dept of Education Blockchain in Education Report

Kerri Lemoie:  Project part of phase 1 of Ed Blockchain project
Kerri Lemoie:  What is going in in the ecosystem to inform a 
  challenge, to be launched soon
Kerri Lemoie:  40 Entities/experts interviews, lit review, online 
  research
Kerri Lemoie:  Findings - 70 active initiatives, many in pilot 
  stages, many academic and digital credentials, blockcerts
Joshua Marks: I was supposed to scribe today, but got waylaid. 
  WHo is scribing?
Kerri Lemoie:  Newer efforts using hyper-ledger, portfolios, CVs, 
  prof. evaluations, identity protection, etc.
Kerri Lemoie:  This is a top priority - many understand this is 
  important, and 2nd big theme was life-long-learning
Kerri Lemoie:  3Rd theme - connecting ecosystems
Kerri Lemoie:  Many credentials not being used, need more success 
  in leveraging power of connected ecosystems
Kerri Lemoie:  Underuse of digital credentials...lot of issuing, 
  not use
Kerri Lemoie:  Questions remain - what does it mean to control?
Kerri Lemoie:  Digital divide - 29% dont't have smart phones, 46% 
  don't have computers...need to consider who can't access digital 
  creds.
Kerri Lemoie:  Can we find ways to pilot with groups that don't 
  currently have access
Kerri Lemoie:  Standards still in development...good we are 
  workingnn together to move forward.
Kerri Lemoie:  Privacy by design
Kerri Lemoie:  More adoption in higher ed than in K12 (some 
  transcript uses in high schools)... Question is what value this 
  brings beyond the status quo
Victoria Feng:  How long will it take for usage to take off?
Kerri Lemoie:  Open Badges has been in existence over a decade 
  and is still underutilized... pilots for a couple more years, 
  then not sure
Kerri Lemoie: Directory of efforts: 
  https://usedgov.github.io/blockchain/directory
J. Philipp Schmidt:  Asking about tension between centralized 
  platform business models vs. decentralized models and 
  self-sovereign
J. Philipp Schmidt: Thank you!
Kerri Lemoie:  Business models not yet fully considered for 
  decentralized...pilots often in private networks
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  What problems do solutions solve... 
  interesting that many pilots are in private networks... What was 
  your read on nuance behind "why" using blockchain?
Loïc Jeannin: I'd like to ask a question, what is the process ? 
  :)
Kerri Lemoie:  I think many are looking at centralized models, 
  considering characteristics of blockchain that are useful (e.g. 
  verification), but not enough use cases ....then can consider how
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Recommendation from report: focus on 
  ecosystems
Kerri Lemoie:  Other main use case is to encourage use of 
  standards
Kerri Lemoie:  Greenlight is  a private network that is working 
  well because it improves processes for students, e.g to apply for 
  college
Kerri Lemoie:  In Open Badges we said "It's not about the badge" 
  , about how it is used
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Q about Dalas Comm. College and Greenlight
Kerri Lemoie:  Joe May (sp?) started with seeing challenges for 
  students to apply for multiple colleges
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Interesting to see use case around student 
  needs
