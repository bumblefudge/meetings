[2020-06-29T15:08:37.525Z]	<kimhd>	Topic: US Dept of Education Blockchain in Education Report
[2020-06-29T15:09:12.855Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Project part of phase 1 of Ed Blockchain project
[2020-06-29T15:09:45.706Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: What is going in in the ecosystem to inform a challenge, to be launched soon
[2020-06-29T15:10:27.447Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: 40 entities/experts interviews, lit review, online research
[2020-06-29T15:11:12.033Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Findings - 70 active initiatives, many in pilot stages, many academic and digital credentials, blockcerts
[2020-06-29T15:11:42.291Z]	<Joshua_Marks>	I was supposed to scribe today, but got waylaid. WHo is scribing?
[2020-06-29T15:12:02.154Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Newer efforts using hyper-ledger, portfolios, CVs, prof. evaluations, identity protection, etc.
[2020-06-29T15:12:08.286Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-06-29T15:13:18.189Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: This is a top priority - many understand this is important, and 2nd big theme was life-long-learning
[2020-06-29T15:13:49.386Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: 3rd theme - connecting ecosystems
[2020-06-29T15:14:48.966Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Many credentials not being used, need more success in leveraging power of connected ecosystems
[2020-06-29T15:15:30.973Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Underuse of digital credentials...lot of issuing, not use
[2020-06-29T15:16:01.205Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Questions remain - what does it mean to control?
[2020-06-29T15:16:54.486Z]	<Victoria_xdemic>	Q+ what is school's biggest concern to issue/accept blochanin digital credentials?
[2020-06-29T15:17:03.568Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Digital divide - 29% dont't have smart phones, 46% don't have computers...need to consider who can't access digital creds.
[2020-06-29T15:17:36.998Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Can we find ways to pilot with groups that don't currently have access
[2020-06-29T15:18:13.713Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Standards still in development...good we are workingnn together to move forward.
[2020-06-29T15:18:23.334Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Privacy by design
[2020-06-29T15:18:34.926Z]	<kimhd>	ack Victoria_xdemic
[2020-06-29T15:20:52.225Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: More adoption in higher ed than in K12 (some transcript uses in high schools)... Question is what value this brings beyond the status quo

[2020-06-29T15:22:32.406Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Open Badges has been in existence over a decade and is still underutilized... pilots for a couple more years, then not sure

[2020-06-29T15:25:17.047Z]	<kimhd>	ack kimhd
[2020-06-29T15:25:21.994Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Business models not yet fully considered for decentralized...pilots often in private networks
[2020-06-29T15:27:17.675Z]	<JimGoodell>	KimHD: What problems do solutions solve... interesting that many pilots are in private networks... What was your read on nuance behind "why" using blockchain?
[2020-06-29T15:28:04.812Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-06-29T15:28:39.969Z]	<loic>	I'd like to ask a question, what is the process ? :)
[2020-06-29T15:28:45.906Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: I think many are looking at centralized models, considering characteristics of blockchain that are useful (e.g. verification), but not enough use cases ....then can consider how
[2020-06-29T15:29:16.604Z]	<JimGoodell>	KimHD: recommendation from report: focus on ecosystems
[2020-06-29T15:29:44.350Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: other main use case is to encourage use of standards
[2020-06-29T15:30:25.718Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Greenlight is  a private network that is working well because it improves processes for students, e.g to apply for college
[2020-06-29T15:31:04.029Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: In Open Badges we said "It's not about the badge" , about how it is used
[2020-06-29T15:31:39.686Z]	<JimGoodell>	KimHD: q about Dalas Comm. College and Greenlight
[2020-06-29T15:32:28.325Z]	<JimGoodell>	Kerri Lemoie: Joe May (sp?) started with seeing challenges for students to apply for multiple colleges
