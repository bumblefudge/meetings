<ildiko_mazar_(ntt_data)> Thanks, Simone.
<simone_ravaioli> Hello Céline ! Thanks for joining us...
<simone_ravaioli> Hello Michal ! Great to see you.
<simone_ravaioli> yes, I think it is the transcriber... let's go 
  on.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Céline_Jambon: Just for Learning and the European learning model 
  so the European learning model is the data model that is behind 
  the European credentials for learning.
Céline_Jambon: Um do search through credentials for learning or 
  um a set of Standards but we also um have specific software for 
  the issuing the storing ceiling signing um and sharing of 
  credentials.
Céline_Jambon: Um our broader policy context is the European 
  pillar of social rights and its action plan um and in particular 
  of the first action did that is related to uh Education and 
  Training.
Céline_Jambon: Policy context also covers the European skills 
  agenda that was adopted in 2020.
Céline_Jambon: Um and also the um European education area 
  communication.
Céline_Jambon: Um we also have a different policy document and 
  background directly uh underpinning that the credentials for 
  learning in particular the europas decision which is uh the legal 
  base for the commission to develop this part of the 
  infrastructure.
Céline_Jambon: And uh the European qualifications framework um 
  their looks like qualifications but it also has an Annex that 
  looks directly at um the data field on how to describe uh 
  qualification in the EU.
Céline_Jambon: Um on top of that we have the micro credentials 
  Council recommendation that has a the same approach as the 
  European qualification framework it has an Annex um with data 
  fields on how to describe a micro credential in Europe and those 
  all these uh data fields of the basis for uh creating digital 
  credentials under the European do credentials for learning 
  framework.
Céline_Jambon: Uh finally we can mention a few other documents 
  the digital education action plan um the digital decade as well 
  the European skills competencies and occupations taxonomy and the 
  individual learning account recommendation that refers directly 
  to um this credentials.
Céline_Jambon: In the next slide.
Céline_Jambon: You can see um the borrower context for the 
  European super dangerous for learning um why is the commission 
  interested well first of all it is an increasingly um 
  digitalizing world so we need to have adaptability and to have a 
  flexibility to move away from or on top of paper to uh have a to 
  solution and it is fully aligned with the commission and the EU 
  border digital strategy.
Céline_Jambon: Um for us the key pillar as well is uh security 
  and Trust so we have Temple proof credentials um or rather tempor 
  evident credentials within based on an e that is based on EU uh 
  legislation that ensures that we have more we have a recognition 
  of the electronic seals that we are using and it is also um 
  important for us to uh fight uh diploma means and the fraud in 
  the field of education training credentials.
Céline_Jambon: Recognition so um as the European commission we 
  are looking at ways uh to support uh labor and learning mobility 
  in the union and 1 of the ways uh to support that 1 is um to have 
  recognition and to have a simple way of presenting both knowledge 
  and uh skills and where does the knowledge come from.
Céline_Jambon: We have a standardized presentation it's uh can 
  get easier for recognition body in their assessment of the 
  different skills and knowledge um due to also uh the rendering of 
  the different achievements and it's also transparent On the 
  Origin so we ensure that stakeholders know the source and the 
  authenticity of every credentials thus fostering the trust.
Céline_Jambon: The fourth point is showcasing Knowledge and 
  Skills so there um we have a a high adaptability to labor market 
  uh needs and relevance because we have this focus on learning 
  outcomes and achievements and skills so to go beyond as well um 
  qualifications but to look at skills directly and it's also a 
  lifelong learning approach meaning that uh we do not focus only 
  on formal education but we also consider non-formal education and 
  we look at all the different sectors we look at adult learning in 
  the same way that we look at the vocational education and 
  training at Apprentice ships uh but also at general education.
Céline_Jambon: And finally what is also very important for us is 
  the ownership of data so the recipient of the credential is the 1 
  in control of the wallet and their portfolio so it will Empower 
  them because they have control of all their achievements and also 
  ensures data privacy and security.
Céline_Jambon: All these um landscape of wallets and portfolios 
  um Can facilitate the easier management the sharing and also the 
  verification of the credentials in uh disconnected ecosystem 
  where the owner can share only a presentation of uh the 
  credential so it makes it easier for them to um navigate the 
  different landscape.
Céline_Jambon: Um in the next slide you will see a brief overview 
  of um all the different evolution of the infrastructure since 
  2023 um 2023 was a very big year a milestone in the European 
  credentials for learning um development because we had a major 
  upgrade moving uh towards the latest version of our data model 
  the European learning model and at the same time we upgraded the 
  whole infrastructure into uh Jason um credentials.
Céline_Jambon: In our next release last year we introduced 
  accreditation with um a connection with the European data um the 
  European um data um Quality Assurance register and we also had uh 
  another release looking at uh improving usability and credential 
  visualization.
<simone_ravaioli> DEQAR - 
  https://www.eqar.eu/about/projects/deqar-project/about-deqar/
Céline_Jambon: Finally and this is a bit the core for tonight's 
  presentation is um the latest 2.3 uh update and we are very happy 
  um to present it to you and I will hand over the floor to uh my 
  colleague Justin Cook to do the presentation.
Justin_Cooke: Thank you very much Selene so I will take you 
  through some of the updates that are coming in at EDC 2.3.
Justin_Cooke: Uh if I just go to the next slide okay so um the 
  EDC infrastructure is is made up of a number of components um we 
  have a viewer we have the online credential Builder we have the 
  wallet and verify it.
Justin_Cooke: So focusing on the viewer and the ocp to start 
  with.
Justin_Cooke: We have 1 of the I guess 1 of the biggest changes 
  in the release.
Justin_Cooke: Which is about the uh validity of the signatures in 
  the credentials.
Justin_Cooke: Mimic in the paper world where we expect a diploma 
  to be valid for life.
Justin_Cooke:  we need.
Justin_Cooke: To make sure that any credentials that are issued 
  to the uh to the students and so on uh also valid for life.
Justin_Cooke: And the way we do this is to extend the signature 
  validity of the credentials because typically they are only valid 
  for a number of years.
Justin_Cooke: So this feature is about allowing the uh well 
  basically the viewer will provide information to the user when 
  the upload a credential to tell them if the signature is about to 
  expire.
Justin_Cooke:  and if.
Justin_Cooke: Is about to expire I think it's within 12 months.
Justin_Cooke: Then the system will propose to sign the credential 
  uh sorry extend the signature of the credential by applying a 
  digital time stamp.
Justin_Cooke: And then don't know that credential again.
Justin_Cooke: Those are all the parts to this signature validity 
  which I'll come on to soon.
Justin_Cooke: And then we've got a number of um display oriented 
  um features so allowing additional identifiers to be provided for 
  the credential holder so for example a student ID.
Justin_Cooke: Um some improvements in the way that notes and the 
  documents are viewed in the viewer.
Justin_Cooke: Um so we've got some other um other elements such 
  as uh changes to the default display settings so that certain 
  things are also like expanded rather than collapsed things like 
  this.
Justin_Cooke: Um so moving on to the latter parts of the list um 
  the the other thing I guess worth mentioning at the bottom is 
  that we're now permitting decimal values in some of the fields uh 
  uh numeric in nature so things like durations and volume of 
  learning and and and so on so previously this was only allowing 
  integer values so now we provide uh features for decimal values 
  as well.
Justin_Cooke: Let's moving up moving on to the wallet part of the 
  um infrastructure.
Justin_Cooke: So 1 of the things that was disabled as part of the 
  transition from XML to Json was the downloading of a credential.
Justin_Cooke: No that's been enabled again in version 2.3 so the 
  users can now download the Json credentials from their wallets to 
  their file system if they need to.
Justin_Cooke: And coming back to this whole um signature validity 
  question.
Justin_Cooke:  we've also.
Justin_Cooke: A mechanism by which the wallet will auto check all 
  of the credentials um for expiry um well.
Justin_Cooke: Credentials that are soon to expire basically so 
  that um we can also extend.
Justin_Cooke: The signatures by applying digital's time stamp so 
  this I think applies to credentials that are going to expire 
  within 3 months but this can be configured also.
Justin_Cooke: Another thing that we've allowed uh from the issue 
  of perspective is to configure multiple wallets.
Justin_Cooke: To deliver the credentials to uh with 1 being a 
  default wallet but also providing mechanism to um to send to 
  either not that default wallet or multiple wallets.
Justin_Cooke: Um and the last item on the list here is providing 
  API access so this is mainly for implementers um the 
  infrastructure to provide a mechanism to.
Justin_Cooke: Use existing credential templates through an API by 
  uploading or providing a spreadsheet Excel or CSV file which 
  contains.
Justin_Cooke: The uh recipient information.
Justin_Cooke: To automate the whole credential creation signature 
  and sending process.
Justin_Cooke: And then some miscellaneous updates so we have a 
  mechanism or feature in the uh credential Builder to allow the 
  issuer to specify custom HTML templates to provide a different 
  look and feel for the credentials.
Justin_Cooke: As part of this um update to Jason a cheat sheet 
  has been provided to allow or to provide guidance basically in 
  moving from the the old XPath.
Justin_Cooke: Mechanisms to to the new adjacent mechanisms.
Justin_Cooke: 1 of the things that we discovered um regarding the 
  signature and the ecls were that was that some European ecl 
  providers.
Justin_Cooke: Provide the type information for the seals that are 
  giving out and this was causing some issues for us in the 
  verification process whereas in fact if you check the the main 
  libraries of DSs libraries for these seals they pass.
Justin_Cooke: So we needed to relax this constraint to allow the 
  type label to be left unknown.
Justin_Cooke: And then we have an update to the Esco um 
  classification or version if you like so this is the European 
  skills classification.
Justin_Cooke: We were on version 1.09 we've now moved to 1 dot 1 
  dot 2.
Justin_Cooke: And finally on this list we have are moving some of 
  the controlled list reference data to the European publish 
  locations office.
Justin_Cooke: And then in the future we'll be relying on this 
  information when issuing credentials and verifying credentials to 
  make sure that we.
Justin_Cooke: Populate the credentials such as the schema 
  information with the correct data.
Justin_Cooke: And that's it for 2.3.
Justin_Cooke: And then on the last slide was the little teaser um 
  for EDC 2.4 which is also on its way.
Justin_Cooke: This is mainly focused on technical upgrades 
  there's been some quite significant um.
Justin_Cooke: Rights to the Java platform the user interface 
  framework uh spring and a number of other big things that we had 
  to do um to provide a platform to move the developments forward 
  in the future.
Justin_Cooke: No that's being done as part of 2.4 1 of the 
  additional features if you like uh that we managed to squeeze in 
  there it's 2.4.
Justin_Cooke: Was the a mechanism to opt out of creating a 
  temporary wallet for users who don't have a wallet yet so we have 
  this feature where.
Justin_Cooke: When a credential is issued it's the um the holder 
  doesn't have a wallet that exists already then we will put a 
  temporary 1 which lasts for several months which then the the 
  user then can claim and then link to their your password accounts 
  accordingly.
Justin_Cooke: Uh we have for gdpr reasons we have the mechanism 
  to opt out of um.
Justin_Cooke: Of this feature if needed from the issuing 
  perspective.
Justin_Cooke: And then in terms of timing yeah we expect 2.4 to 
  be released um during the month of May this year.
Justin_Cooke: And that's all I have to say on.
Justin_Cooke: EDC 2.3 2.4.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sure yeah uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh thank you so much um this this is fabulous 
  I think my question was you mentioned there was um uh an API to 
  transport these credentials to and from wallets right I just 
  wanted to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh to ask about that like which which API is 
  it using is there like a link to the docs is it the open ID 
  family of API is that sort of thing.
Justin_Cooke: That's a very good question um so I don't know if 
  anyone can answer that it's on the call at the moment.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay no problem but it should be in the 
  documentation somewhere right.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay sounds good then no worries.
Justin_Cooke: Yeah yeah sure yeah I mean this is all.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Understood understood I.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Got it uh go ahead Simone.
Justin_Cooke: Okay so by default we have a wallet an online 
  wallet which is hosted alongside um a system called europass.
Justin_Cooke: Um so your past users um also basically have a 
  wallet and online wallets in which they the credentials can be 
  stored.
Justin_Cooke: So that's the 1 that's hosted by the commission but 
  there's also the open source version of EDC which um.
Justin_Cooke: Which implementers can can install themselves 
  deploy themselves and create their own instances of an online 
  wallet.
Justin_Cooke: Future we're we'll be looking at integrating with 
  other types of wallets that will be uh part of other initiatives 
  from the from the EU such as the EU EU di wallets.
Justin_Cooke: Last thing that will be coming in the future.
<eric_shepherd> Yes. It was ansered
Simone Ravaoli: 
  https://www.eqar.eu/about/projects/deqar-project/about-deqar/
Céline_Jambon: Uh perhaps I can start and then uh colleagues uh 
  feel free to add so um a car is the European quality assurance 
  register so it's a separate organization it was developed under 
  the bolognia framework to look at uh quality assurance uh.
Céline_Jambon: Or either institutions or programs in higher 
  education now there are also starting to look as well at a micro 
  credentials.
Céline_Jambon: What do you uh have is a database with all the 
  different records of accreditation and what we have in the DCS 
  the possibility to link directly from um the car the reference to 
  the uh record meaning that you can issue credentials in the 
  regular way but you can also issue credentials in an accredited 
  way meaning that we would also check the accreditation record and 
  the match um between the issuer and uh the accreditation.
Céline_Jambon: Um and I'm not an expert in accreditation.
Céline_Jambon: Um but uh basically you have different uh quality 
  assurance in the different member states and then you have this 
  European level.
Céline_Jambon: So it's um.
<simone_ravaioli> This is what I am referring to - 
  https://hub.ebsi.eu/get-started/build/tao
Céline_Jambon: It's not it's more about sharing information.
Céline_Jambon: On the accreditation elements in the records.
Céline_Jambon: Um because usually um the institutions go through 
  the quality assurance in their own member states so they have a 
  an authority that is in charge of the whole process.
https://europa.eu/europass/elm-browser/documentation/rdf/ap/ams/documentation/ams-constraints.html
<laura_paglione> What is the term that folks are using for the 
  agency/ framework? Is it ECAR?
<simone_ravaioli> EQAR
<laura_paglione> Thx. Got it
Céline_Jambon: So in terms of uh adoptions we have so far around 
  um 25,000 credentials that are stored in the europas wallets.
Céline_Jambon: Uh meaning that uh credentials that uh people have 
  kept in the your password so they may be more credentials that 
  have been issued because we do not check the credentials 
  themselves.
Céline_Jambon: Terms of use cases we have quite a different 
  variety of implementers so um we have some that are informal 
  sector with for instance Luxembourg was 1 of the front runner 
  with all their uh vocational education diplomas issued uh using 
  both paper and the Europeans to credentials for learning format.
Céline_Jambon: Um then we have over implementers so we had also 
  the University of split in Croatia.
Céline_Jambon: Um we have other member states that are looking at 
  a bit larger scale implementation.
Céline_Jambon: Jane has a major project called certain difficult 
  where they are um looking to develop their own system but 
  interoperable with the Europeans to credentials for learning.
Céline_Jambon: So we are also um in contact and supporting those 
  uh implementation use case Estonia is also looking for instance 
  as a bit of a broader um digitalization of their learning 
  credentials project.
Céline_Jambon: Um we have also Malta uh looking at all their um 
  secondary education diplomas to be issued using the system.
Céline_Jambon: Then we have a non-formal education credentials 
  there we have um 1 of our biggest um and most recent implementers 
  is going to be um.
Céline_Jambon: EIT so the European innovation technology um.
Céline_Jambon: Organization for you know energy called in our 
  energy so there they are upskilling adults in the field of uh 
  everything related to is.
Céline_Jambon: It will be um all of their uh training will lead 
  to editions of such a credential uh we also have smaller scale um 
  with Asos plus project also using the the system we have the 
  aurasma student Network that has been uh issuing those 
  credentials for um their non-formal training that they give 
  within the context of the association.
Céline_Jambon: So that gives a bit of uh broader picture um now 
  in terms of how we engage uh we are also working on our own 
  strategy and how we want also to keep pushing forward we also 
  rely a lot on the national uh Europa centers that are the centers 
  in the member states and also in the EU uh in the candidate and 
  potential candidate and the EA countries.
<sharon_leu> How have you been testing interoperability of 
  credentials between implementers?
Céline_Jambon: Are on the ground they are in the member states 
  and they know the direct stakeholders they can also uh relay 
  information in national language so they also an important 
  multiplier as well for the 2.
Céline_Jambon: At least for me the question is not super clear on 
  the type of interpretability we're talking about.
<anthony_f._camilleri> We don't standardise transport protocols 
  for credentials, and we don't do stuff like DIDs, so we only do 
  checks on the formats of the credentials themselves.
Sharon Leu:  Sorry I've been sick so my voice is like very 
  terrible right now um I'm just curious like so the different 
  implementers they're Implement they're issuing different 
  credentials have you been um um looking to see if the credentials 
  are portable across the different um wallets that are being used 
  in these different cases or um that you know um people can 
  extract the data with meaning from the credentials as expected 
  and you know all of the different interoperability related 
  questions on verification and things like that.
<anthony_f._camilleri> So all we need for interop, is a valid 
  JSON-LD file that verifies against our RDF-SHACL at this stage.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sorry Anthony in uh in chat mentioned that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All that's needed for interop is like uh rdf 
  shackle validation but I I agree with Sharon about the question 
  though because it's 1 thing to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh to specify a uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A specification a data model even formally 
  specify like with Chaka validation or Json schema and it's 
  another thing to see the credential on a vendor's wallet.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Right and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So like uh Sharon and and some of the other 
  VCU Community has uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Implemented grants and and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Held a series of interoperability plug fests 
  where.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You know we were practically testing okay 
  here's the credential here's the specification now actually 
  displayed in your wallet or transfer it from the issuer to the 
  wallet or from the wallet to the verifier right and I think uh 
  part of what Sharon was asking is have you have you performed any 
  of that testing.
<anthony_f._camilleri> Short answer is no in a public environment 
  - nothing like a plugfest up to this point. We do  integration 
  assistance on a bilateral basis with implementers via our support 
  team.
Céline_Jambon: Well thank you Simone we'll keep that in mind and 
  if we ever decide to pursue that route we'll get in touch thank 
  you.
<simone_ravaioli> Thank you colleagues from EDC !
<naomi> Thank you!
<céline_jambon> Thank you very much for having us. Our support 
  team can be reached at: EMPL-ELM-SUPPORT@ec.europa.eu
<sharon_leu> This is great work. We'll keep you all in the loop 
  for upcoming plugfesting activities!
<eric_shepherd> Thank you. You are doing important work and we 
  appreciate you sharing your achievements.
