Topic: Web3 Onboarding Use Case

Evin: Hey guys how's it going I'm Evan McMullen here from the 
  Disco team super excited to join the conversation I'm here joined 
  with my colleague and co-founder Johnny Howell we've been 
  floating around the edge of the w3c ecosystem for many years but 
  super excited to be here Live In Living Color to join you all 
  today.
<kerri_lemoie> Welcome @Evin & @Jonny!
Simone Ravaoli:  Lovely thanks everyone for for the breaking the 
  eyes and looking forward to hear what you guys are up to anyone 
  else to say hello.
Jonny: Yeah so Evan Evan just mentioned me but Johnny work with 
  Evan on Disco product leading co-founder over there and great to 
  do it.
Simone Ravaoli:  I did Johnny welcome welcome.
Simone Ravaoli:  But if you just don't feel like opening up the 
  mic now there is going to be an opportunity throughout the call 
  to jump in wait please I see someone coming off on video thank 
  you.
Simone Ravaoli:  Yeah no you cannot hear you though.
<jan_muehlig> mic tricks needed
Simone Ravaoli:  Maybe Dixie playing audio tricks on you.
<kerri_lemoie> Hey folks - I'll keep an eye on the transcriber 
  but if you notice anything getting transcribed badly, feel free 
  to make the substitution like: s/Dixie/Jitsi
Simone Ravaoli:  Yeah maybe you want to try to work on that you 
  know happy to just please keep yourself up you know at any point 
  and love to hear from you and welcome anyways yeah.
Simone Ravaoli:  At you you put something in the chat regarding 
  you looking for a community manager you want to up in Mike now we 
  ask and share that directly.
Simone Ravaoli:  All right no apparently so but please folks look 
  in the chat.
Simone Ravaoli:  .
<chris_kelly_(dif)> Sound issues!  :(
<jan_muehlig> hi together, I am Jan, on behalf of ICoBC, very 
  much looking forward to hear about this topic
<chris_kelly_(dif)> Thanks for the shout out
Simone Ravaoli:  If is looking for a community manager that's 
  great opportunity okay okay all right we're through that love to 
  jump into the conversation today we are going to talk about web 
  through him verifiable credentials and and particularly through 
  guess the mines you know eyes and mouths of Johnny and Evan Dave.
Simone Ravaoli:   Ben really.
<don_presant> Hi all, Don from Canada - CanCred.ca and Learning 
  Agents
Simone Ravaoli:  Weaving a strong narrative around verifiable 
  credentials and decentralized identifiers in a way that connects 
  a lot of use cases you know I think when we when we reflect on 
  adoption and the work that we do here you know the option being 
  the ultimate goal we would probably need strategies or just way 
  of articulating the value and I think they're up to something and 
  I don't want to take away any more time from them because I think 
  this is good I would we want to hear from.
Simone Ravaoli:   Them and then also have.
Simone Ravaoli:  Conversation together so heavy now I will just 
  pass a forward to you and take it away.
<kerri_lemoie> One thing worth noting from a CCG infrastructure 
  perspective. Slide & video sharing can because the recording & 
  transcriber to quit so while this is being investigated, we 
  aren't sharing slides in video while presenting.
Evin: Awesome thank you guys so much for having us today and 
  really excited to work with all of you to make verifiable 
  credentials the awesome standard in practice that they are specs 
  in the hypothetical so I know obviously you know many many of you 
  have been working on this for many years John I have have worked 
  on a variety of implementations for verifiable credentials from 
  Enterprise to education which is what we're thinking about 
  together here today so I'll invite.
Evin: Me in a minute to tell.
Evin: Us a little bit more.
Evin: About disco as it will be introduced to the world in early 
  April but we see a really exciting opportunity for verifiable 
  credentials to provide the Firepower from which web 3 in the 
  crypto ecosystem can you know can get its power we're seeing 
  right now that there is a surge of desire to work in the crypto 
  and web three ecosystem and that because there's not a lot of 
  formal education available around.
Evin:  round around that content.
Evin: See many different you know diverse credentialing issuers 
  many organizations that are providing some of this guidance but 
  very few ways for a user an individual to accrue that expertise 
  proofs of their learning and expertise in a rapid manner that 
  allows them to share that expertise in those proofs with a 
  potential employer a decentralized autonomous organization that 
  they want to be part of or some other entity or group creating 
  content.
Evin:  went around this ecosystem and.
Evin: So we think that there is a really exciting chance for us 
  to insert verifiable credentials into this process and to enable 
  the web three education ecosystem the crypto education ecosystem 
  to issue these credentials at a high velocity and to enable users 
  to present them with similar speed and validity and so you know 
  as we talked about like what are the killer use cases what are 
  the use cases with high velocity.
Evin:  city of.
Evin: And for credential issuance and high velocity of demand for 
  credential verification we see this sort of as a perfect storm 
  and so to talk a little bit more about how how disco as a product 
  offering and you know set of apis and sdks will begin to enable 
  this universe I'll hand it over to Johnny to share a little bit 
  more about our product Vision overall and then more specifically 
  how we're thinking about initial use cases.
Jonny: Yeah so thanks Evan so at disco what we're trying to do in 
  the early part of April is launched something that can facilitate 
  the user experience for the end user for interacting with 
  verifiable credentials and did so I know I mean I don't know 
  everybody here but I'm sure many of you have worked on maybe the 
  standards and the protocols and you know that's something that I 
  haven't.
Jonny: I used to work on I used to work.
Jonny: Team.
Jonny: Out you port back in the day where we were working on some 
  of these things before these standards arose and.
Jonny: Now that mean and Nota Bene and you know many others that 
  are working you know building the building out these standards 
  and figuring out a lot of the technical complexity under the hood 
  evident eyes goal here is to bring a user experience layer to 
  this that allows people who you know as as we see the abundance 
  of issuers who are capable of signing verifiable credentials and 
  issuing them to users we want to build a thing a product that 
  allows a user to take custody of those.
Jonny:  these.
Jonny: Use.
Jonny: He's agnostic form so many of the pocs we've worked on and 
  seen in the past usually result in some proprietary app that 
  works with the issuer so the issuer has its own app for the user 
  to store their VC's in and we want to build something that is 
  more under the users control so that's what disco is Disco allows 
  a user to take custody of VCS issued from any number of issuers 
  hopefully we want to expand to allowing lots of different type of 
  VCS.
Jonny:  yes I know that there's you know.
Jonny: Beauty.
Jonny: Based ones json-ld ones and we want to support all those 
  we want to support user taking credentials from you know you know 
  our friends at trinsic or and the evernham ecosystem or we have 
  friends that's you know ontology and orange and then of course in 
  the etherium ecosystem like Spruce and all of those things so 
  we're built to start on ceramic as the storage layer but we want 
  to integrate ID hubs and spruces Kepler and any of the.
Jonny:  others would be great to hear if anybody else is working 
  on.
Jonny: VC credential storage for end users we would love to 
  integrate with you as well but in April we're planning to launch 
  a tool that allows a user to receive these credentials in an 
  inbox so you might use an issuing Library like spruces I did kit 
  or something like that or Verano or something like that to issue 
  credentials and to your user they can take custody of them using 
  a web app which is Disco and we do this by.
Jonny:  by leveraging the.
Jonny: And.
<taylor> Getting a look under the hood. Should be more accessible 
  than many of these calls :)
Jonny: Web three infrastructure which is a theory of wallets that 
  works well with ceramic so you just simply can Target a user's 
  did by targeting their aetherium address using ether did and 
  related also is 3id Method from ceramic that we also support and 
  your user can take they don't need a wallet you know especially 
  wallet they do need a web three wallet to start so something like 
  a metal mask or rainbow or anything that's supported by wallet 
  connect.
Jonny:  t' and the user can receive a credential to their inbox.
Jonny: By default State decrypt it to add it to their public 
  profile and then as they go on their Journey around web three 
  they connect their wallets to all the subsequent apps even web to 
  apps and those apps can call our API and read what credentials 
  are issued to them by whom a lot of this is backed up by using 
  verifiable credentials to a linked account so we don't want you 
  know we're trying as best as possible to encourage people to link 
  human-readable identifiers like Twitter accounts or.
Jonny:  mine's too.
Jonny: The key.
Jonny: The public identifiers that they're going to sign 
  credentials with you know this is either using the dot well-known 
  did configuration document method or just simply placing a 
  verifiable credential proof at the DNS registrar you know as a 
  txt record attached to that this allows you know when you present 
  a user presents a credential to some other third party for that 
  third party to know that it was signed by some human readable 
  entity like you know University dot edu or something like.
Jonny:  that.
Jonny: Also are excited to introduce the ability for end users to 
  sign credentials and issue them to other end users using VIP 712 
  sign typed data method in the etherium world so users will be 
  able to issue credentials so I've worked in the space for you 
  know many years and I haven't assigned very many credentials on 
  my own has a non developer and a design and a designer I don't 
  really use.
Jonny:  is the command line that much and things like that and.
Jonny: There's only been a few products that I've used that allow 
  me to sign with some keys in my control as of right now I know 
  that there are probably some that I don't know about but we are 
  really trying to make that accessible to the early adopters of 
  these Technologies which we see as the web three community and 
  they also have a lot of blockers right now that one of their core 
  tenets of many of these use cases is being decentralized and part 
  of that is the user data being decentralized and so we think it's 
  a you know a very right.
Jonny:  type and fertile.
Jonny: And.
Jonny: Us to start getting very quick feedback loops on the usage 
  of feces so there's lots of things I'm you know maybe we could 
  talk about one of the conversations that we've been talking about 
  recently is you know how do we allow like a dow who does wants to 
  do education how do we allow them to sign you know credentials of 
  proof of knowledge and things like that and that comes with some 
  technical complexities but yeah that's what we plan to launch in 
  April and there's a long-term.
Jonny:  Vision that I'm sure you're all familiar with in terms of 
  you.
Jonny: S.
Jonny: Space selective disclosure and verifiable presentation 
  support being able to store credentials locally on device you 
  know many of these things and happy to dig into any of that but 
  I'll kick it back to you Evan.
Evin: Awesome thank you so much Johnny so you know for today 
  would love to invite any questions that anybody has if your 
  organization's are interested in being able to deploy this 
  technology we would love to chat with you but further beyond that 
  were very interested in ensuring that the right standards make it 
  into the hands of these credential issuers so very excited to to 
  you know continue to Define that path for.
Evin:  for our partners.
Evin: Ecosystem of the a player that are in a position to be 
  issuing credentials so that we can ensure compliance with the 
  thoughtful decision making of this this particular body you know 
  that there are a number of sort of ad hoc standards entities 
  working to adopt shared standards so that we can express the full 
  portability of these Primitives and so as we you know start to 
  spin up collaborations using our products once they're live in.
Evin:  in a few short weeks we would love to.
Evin: Be able to.
Evin: Contribute to the community started by those on this call 
  and provide some real life use cases where we've got end-users 
  hanging out and you know ready ready to engage these Technologies 
  so I know we've been chatting for quite a long time so happy to 
  you know open for any questions and just generally invite invite 
  conversation on the floor.
Evin: .
Simone Ravaoli:  Thank you have any thank you Johnny great and 
  thank you for joining us today I wanted to break the ice with the 
  question that is around use cases so part of the work that we're 
  doing right now is also collecting different use cases around be 
  seized in education and specifically what use cases do you see 
  connected to web three and education surfacing can you speak to 
  that.
Simone Ravaoli:  .
Evin: Most certainly I know Johnny thinks about this a lot so 
  I'll kick it over to him next but in the web three ecosystem 
  there is not a standard set of formal reputation at Esther's 
  there's not you know there are not a lot of Institutions that 
  confer things like degrees or standardized achievements in the 
  same way that we might you know enjoy transcripts and diplomas 
  from more formalized institutions so there is a.
Evin:  vacuum in terms of the ways that people can.
Evin: Move there.
Evin: Aptitude with the subject matter but there is also a 
  remarkable demand for individuals who can prove such aptitude 
  because there are hundreds probably at this point thousands of 
  companies seeking to seeking to hire folks who have expertise on 
  web three subject matter and who also have Smart contracts 
  deployed that are ready to be able to receive information such as 
  verifiable credentials to be able to execute logic Within.
Evin:  in their own app store.
Evin: Stations so unlike you know higher education and things 
  like diplomas that are that are pretty low velocity pretty hard 
  to earn you know ten of those in the year let's say for as an 
  individual There's an opportunity to both generate you know earn 
  a variety of different proofs of aptitude and there's a lot of 
  Demands to be able to read all of those as well and so in the 
  absence of formal credentialing in the web three space we see an 
  opportunity.
Evin:  Unity for.
Evin: Credentialing you know between the web three education 
  providers and the and the individuals seeking employment in this 
  space as well as the the many different employers who are 
  currently struggling to find people that have the basic knowledge 
  required to participate in their in their organizations and so 
  we're seeing you know as with much of the traditional techies 
  ecosystem in web 3 you know something like 40 to 60%.
Evin:  scent of new hires are social.
Evin: Existing team because there is this massive discoverability 
  problem so because you know Atomic identity and an atomic data 
  allows us to solve that discoverability problem we see this as a 
  great opportunity for dids and VC's to be the transport layer for 
  such qualifying information any further thoughts there and on the 
  unique opportunity in the web three ecosystem right now.
Jonny: Yeah no I think you basically covered it I mean maybe I'm 
  just reiterate a couple things there is just yeah we've seen the 
  giant influx of I mean there's a massive migration having around 
  especially web to devs and other you know tech knowledge workers 
  trying to break into the web three space there is a huge demand I 
  mean our team is hiring we want to hire these people all of our 
  friends in the web three kind of ecosystem.
Jonny: Are you know.
Jonny: Leaf.
Jonny: With a lot of VC cash that are trying to expand our trying 
  to hire like crazy and one of the big things is they want to know 
  does this person have a knowledge of the space and the nuances of 
  working in web three do you know anything about in FTS and dowse 
  etc etc cows have you know had you know are on the rise you know 
  like many other crypto based narratives of the past will see how 
  it evolves in the future but right now dowser looking for people 
  that.
Jonny:  that have experience in.
Jonny: Three.
Jonny: Out of Minton FTS can make generative art can do all of 
  these things and there aren't any formal educational institutions 
  that teach this so there are no formal verifiable credentials 
  that can prove this so that Gap is being filled by bespoke you 
  know institutions that offer courses it mean it looks like you 
  know the type of the web 3 version of things like Coursera and 
  you to me where people just generates content and learning things 
  are good friend Austin Griffith he has speed.
Jonny:  run at the area which is.
Jonny: Little.
Jonny: G to try and get web to developers up to speed on on web 
  three and there are no formal certifications or anything like 
  that there's a couple of entities that some of y'all might be 
  familiar with like C4 our former you know there's our friends at 
  consensus Academy and some attempts here to formalize what an 
  education means and in terms of these topics but it's all very 
  nascent and we're trying to figure out how to allow you know 
  YouTube content.
Jonny:  has that teach solidity and you know off.
Jonny: And Griffin.
Jonny: And these other things like the learn web three Dow how 
  they can issue credentials efficiently and according to a 
  standard in which all of these entities interoperate and are all 
  issuing at least from the same set of schemas for different 
  topics to to allow us to ease the transition of people into the 
  web three space give them an obvious path and steps to take which 
  is hey I'm a web to person I want to move into web 3.
Jonny:  I want to what things do I need.
Jonny: Learn.
Jonny: And how can I get proofs of that so I can easily disclose 
  those credentials in some hiring process and so that's kind of 
  where you know we see disco is being a vehicle through which a 
  user can receive those credentials and then disclose them in the 
  hiring process but right now yeah we need to we as a you know 
  kind of our on our business development side of things where 
  we're reaching out to many of these organizations and having 
  conversations with them and we want to be able to confidently 
  steer them in the right direction.
Jonny:  direction around what how to construct the credentials 
  that they would end up being.
Jonny: Would end.
Jonny: Issue so that's kind of where we are.
Simone Ravaoli:  Thank you very much I think a positive outcome 
  of this chat would be to add one on one or many of these 
  Americans use cases to the list of we're tracking so great Carrie 
  had a question carried over to you thank you.
Kerri Lemoie:  Thanks for being here today this is a super 
  interesting it and Johnny said something about structure and 
  that's kind of a good segue to rid of my questions here many of 
  us here on this called maybe not everyone put if you are familiar 
  with open badges which have been around for quite a long time so 
  these concept of open recognition and being able to recognize 
  outside of side of formalized Education resonates with us really 
  strongly right and so what we've been trying to do is.
Kerri Lemoie:  Aligned standards Lake open badges.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm happy as of.
Kerri Lemoie:  Record which is a similar but it's a multiple 
  credential or sake open badges a single achievement clrs multiple 
  and there are other education achievements to and there's also a 
  networks to finding skilled definitions and all sorts of 
  structure that is coming into play there probably would be coming 
  in even if we didn't have web 3 we're right now we're trying to 
  do is make all of this fit together into verifiable credentials 
  and so what we have a lot in our space is a lot of wallets who 
  are going to be.
Kerri Lemoie:   Very specific to education that are going to know 
  understand how to display.
Kerri Lemoie:  This.
Kerri Lemoie:  This content and you mentioned a meta mask and 
  other web while it's and I was wondering like how you think 
  you're going to approach that and like taking the structure and 
  getting it more globally understood in the way that you're 
  talking about.
Jonny: Yeah so I guess one of our goals and you know where we see 
  the opportunity is to build a system that allows a user to 
  interact with credentials without really needing to adopt any net 
  new infrastructure right so back in the day when I worked on you 
  port we had to have a special you port wallet to do a lot of 
  things and this was a big blocker to adoption at least.
Jonny: Back then and I.
Jonny: Get.
Jonny: Still be now people didn't want to have their meta mask 
  for instance at least in the web three aetherium world and want 
  to have to have a metal mask app and then also jump over to the 
  you poor tap to disclose their credentials so we're trying to 
  make this integrate with the current tools that we see web 
  through users having already and that's our first goal is evm 
  compatible wallets which also include chains outside of the 
  etherium world so.
Jonny:  launch a couple others for instance.
Jonny: So we know that there's been some talk and I have actually 
  not currently up to date with it all about the progress of trying 
  to make open badges compatible with the VC standards it would be 
  great if a etherium wallet so in or some etherium keys according 
  to the way those keys are constructed can sign valid open badges 
  / verifiable credentials and issue them.
Jonny:  to users.
Jonny: We're going to see and to allow etherium users to disclose 
  and do verifiable presentations on those things using those keys 
  that they already have so yeah that's that's kind of forgot your 
  question as I was rambling there but I I think that yes we are 
  totally down with open Badges and it would be great if they are 
  turned into VCS oh yeah.
Jonny:  the other piece I wanted to talk about.
Jonny: Is.
Jonny: I think for us we are at the intersection of a lot of 
  different use cases so not just specifically education so there's 
  you know lots of stuff happening in the entertainment and con 
  Creator space in the web three world so you know music and no 
  other things and ft artists and all of this stuff they want to 
  also take advantage of verifiable credential so we're trying to 
  build a interface that for taking custody and interacting with 
  this type of data that is pretty use case.
Jonny:  Gnostic now one of the big the two big verticals are.
Jonny: Education for US future of work and all of those things 
  and also kind of entertainment media Creator stuff you know fan 
  relationships proof of fandom you know these types of things that 
  people are trying to currently build decentralized communities 
  around so that's why we're trying to build something that is you 
  know that we don't want to be too opinionated on our interface in 
  an hour app about it being for Education explicitly so we need we 
  need to be kind of vanilla in that.
Jonny:  regard.
<kerri_lemoie> One thing we've discussed in VC-EDU is providing 
  info in the credential on how to display it.
Jonny: So yeah that's that's at least our approach so the things 
  whatever comes out of here out of the you know the educational 
  credentials working group we would want it to not be specific to 
  specific at least and its underlying structure and I don't think 
  y'all are probably going to do that but to educational use cases 
  we would want you know any educational credential to be able to 
  sit just alongside and the exact same user interaction patterns 
  that exact same ux to take custody of credentials for other 
  things as well.
Jonny: .
Simone Ravaoli:  Thanks Carrie unless you want to hear your 
  response Nate is on the cube.
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah that's fine you can go thank you.
Simone Ravaoli:  Thanks.
Nate_Otto_(Badgr/CSky): You're attacking carry their who is one 
  of the people deeply involved in the open badges compatibility 
  effort getting that to be C standard as far as timeline there we 
  expect the standard to be pretty much finalized sometime this 
  year and within a few weeks we'll be able to start doing 
  prototype examples of signed credentials which brings me to my 
  question which is if we want to say that one of the important 
  next steps here is to identify what whether we can.
Nate_Otto_(Badgr/CSky): Sign one of these things with an 
  aetherium key do you have.
Nate_Otto_(Badgr/CSky): Good examples to.
Nate_Otto_(Badgr/CSky): To as to what the proof method is that we 
  should use there or some example signed Json so that we can show 
  how that would with one of the two educational use cases within 
  open badges or anything else we talked about here in d.c. edu 
  those two use cases being a skill assertion recipient has the 
  skill or a defined achievement assertion recipient has met the 
  criteria of a particular degree or other achievements.
<kerri_lemoie> Early draft of OBv3 context file: 
  https://github.com/IMSGlobal/openbadges-specification/blob/develop/ob_v3p0/context.json
Jonny: Yeah so I think we'll try and find some links we're really 
  building on some of our team has kind of extended I don't know if 
  it's fully compliant at this stage so maybe we're a little bit 
  ahead of the standards just out of necessity for you know going 
  to mark it on some things and building out some things and so we 
  were building on it with a team called ver Amo what their 
  underlying Library.
Jonny: Reason we're able to.
Jonny: Stan.
Jonny: To use the EIP 712 sign type data standard in in aetherium 
  this allows you to sign structure human readable data which can 
  be formatted as a valid VC and signed with those etherium keys 
  and then you know and I think and it and it works fine for our 
  use case it is not universally compatible yet with me not every 
  type of key it's a it's a specific signature method that.
Jonny:  it allows for for this to work with it.
Jonny: MPS but you know non evm chains is still to be you know 
  figured out spruces did kit I believe there are libraries also 
  allow for this and we might adopt that as well they they were 
  built in originally did this using tasos keys which I think are 
  evm compatible keys I can't be sure I would have to you know look 
  back at the libraries but yeah so right now let me see.
Jonny:  all All Paws were.
Jonny: Ask.
Jonny: Follow up if you if you have something but I'm going to 
  ping my team and see if I can find out right now so I can drop 
  you a link on on the libraries that we're using for that metal 
  mask a siding.
Nate_Otto_(Badgr/CSky): Great thanks so much and as a quick 
  follow-up maybe maybe for Evan what would the user experience be 
  like that you imagine for the signing of a particular I'm 
  credential and where do you see the sort of biggest friction 
  points in terms of building something sensible for onboarding a 
  large number of people to be able to participate in an open 
  educational based recognition.
Evin: Great question I'll actually throw the backs of Johnny and 
  a quick second but the sort of brief takeaway is that user 
  experience will be defining in a how successful everything that 
  occurs after that onboarding is and so disco we are very focused 
  on enabling the sort of smoothest most unintrusive process I 
  guess you might say you know our expectations are.
Evin:  set by Tim Cook.
Evin: And we.
Evin: You know we forget those when we come to to web three or 
  decentralized experiences and so with that in mind I'll hand it 
  over to Johnny to talk a little bit more about you know what that 
  what that process of onboarding looks like and you know what it 
  what it feel will feel like at least to start to start of 
  obtaining these credentials.
Jonny: Yeah so in the past one of the you know back in our 
  experience with in other SSI teams this looks like and I think it 
  still is in a lot of cases it says Hey I've done something in 
  your context you want to send me a credential there's you know 
  there's a lot of times this has been download this app to receive 
  your credential that's been a big blocker and and we've seen it 
  you know firsthand.
Jonny: There's some other workarounds which.
Jonny: Going to.
Jonny: Credential for you until you get a wallet and then you can 
  take custody of it or it uses you know there's been experiments 
  with like chappie and stuff which is like local storage in the 
  browser and you know these not great ux but these like browser 
  dialogues that allow you to interact and see that you've received 
  a credential Etc we're trying a different approach which is we 
  think that while somebody might just show up to disco dot x y z 
  and kit connect wallet and login with or authenticate with meta 
  mask or something like that.
Jonny:  at and have an inbox and start there we think.
Jonny: Of the flow that we're optimizing for is we have a lot of 
  partners that want to issue credentials and though the the first 
  time you X4 somebody interacting with the credential probably 
  happen outside of disco it'll be we have friends that rabbit hole 
  for instance and they kind of do kind of gamified onboarding into 
  web three they ask you to complete some typical web three tasks a 
  like you know do a token swap or you know steak some coins in a 
  contract or a Min ft or something like that all of this is a 
  little cost-prohibitive.
Jonny:  for new users right now but hopefully that those costs 
  come down or they.
Jonny: Floyd.
Jonny: A lot of these.
Jonny: Is kind of modules on to layer two things etcetera Etc 
  anyway putting that aside when the user needs to receive this 
  credential we want the user experience to be one in which hey you 
  have a user you have a verifiable credential we have you can you 
  can get it at disco dot x y z it'll be sitting there in purgatory 
  essentially associated with that user storage and only their keys 
  because.
Jonny:  cuz obviously Rabbit Hole has there.
Jonny: Lick.
Jonny: Identifier and you can encrypt against that and they send 
  it to us to our API we deposit that into some ceramic storage but 
  that might change as we onboard new storage providers one that 
  we're super excited about is privy which has much more you know 
  better privacy-preserving attributes and the user shows up they 
  can follow the link from rabbit hole and now they don't have to 
  download an app but we know that they already have the 
  infrastructure they need which is.
Jonny:  met a mask or something like that and they.
Jonny: Simply.
Jonny: Connect to disco and they will have a notification there 
  that says hey you have a credential waiting for you would you 
  like to add it to your profile and then now we have on-boarded a 
  single user with their first verifiable credential into the space 
  now there's also an alternate path where you do come to disco 
  first and you set up your profile there and we are going to issue 
  some credentials to try and kind of gamify onboarding and we also 
  plan to support a kind of like a Marketplace of like hey I'm here 
  I've got some etherium keys I can take custody of.
Jonny:  feels like an issue.
Jonny: Girls.
Jonny: What should I do right and we want to be able to populate 
  that marketplace with both issuers and relying parties and make 
  that easy for a user to navigate it's very similar to the types 
  of things you see when a layer 2 blockchain launches in the 
  etherium world the very first thing they launched with is a 
  bridge for bridging your assets and then also they launched with 
  a Marketplace of what daps exist and are deployed on this block 
  chain that you can go use right now if you have if you have 
  bridged your assets and so I think we're going to need.
Jonny:  need something very similar there for onboarding users 
  into the verifiable credentials.
Jonny: Rather.
Jonny: Like these disparate unconnected pocs we need a place we 
  need a Marketplace of like I can do more than just the one thing 
  I showed up for where do I do the third fourth fifth sixth 
  seventh thing so that's how we're approaching it right now.
Simone Ravaoli:  One else has a question I feel but I don't want 
  to take up all this our time all right Taylor take it oh thanks.
Simone Ravaoli: +1 To the compelling and accessible narrative
Taylor: Yeah hey thanks thanks a million good to hear from you 
  Evan and Johnny as always I think this is this is broader but I'm 
  curious and giving credit where credit is due I think you guys 
  have some of the most sort of accessible narratives and language 
  around just just making this real and and you know giving Folks 
  at on-ramp to actually think about moving this direction so 
  curious just to yeah get thoughts on like I mean I think there's 
  still a huge just knowledge Gap obviously.
Taylor: The minute we.
Taylor: Except.
Taylor: Of a community like this just discussing this stuff gets 
  really tricky so and part of our role at learning economy is to 
  hopefully you know make some of this a little more accessible so 
  yeah I would love to just kind of here or Riff on ideas around 
  you know different analogies and ways in which you discuss this 
  that that seems to be bridging gaps in knowledge gaps I think 
  that's almost as important as getting some of the tech right is 
  to make sure we have you know easy version.
Taylor:  Ian's of this that folks can sink their teeth into so 
  yeah Evan.
Taylor: In.
Taylor: You've got you've just got a magic touch with with 
  language to make some of this seem very approachable for folks so 
  yeah any good analogies anyways you know what's resonated with 
  other folks that are not necessarily you know in this world or 
  you know web three natives.
<chris_kelly_(dif)> +1!
Evin: Taylor you're the best always so wonderful to be able to 
  jam with you and I think you know you are spot on like in the 
  early 1960s Marshall mcluhan taught us that the medium is the 
  message and our takeaway from 2022 is that the meme is the 
  message we need analogies metaphors tangible examples that people 
  can reach for to help them understand the relationship between 
  these New Primitives and the role that they can play in their 
  actual lives outside the protocol.
Evin:  and so one thing you know I'm sure maybe it maybe Johnny.
Evin: Frances.
Evin: Different.
<simone_ravaioli> we should associate one meme to every use case 
  :-)
Evin: I think that's really surprising to me is that folks who 
  are not web three native understand the concept of verifiable 
  credentials very swiftly it hits right away if your framework is 
  of assumption does not start at a public blockchain now for those 
  who do come from the web three ecosystem I've found that relating 
  verifiable credentials to n FTS so contrasting them from another 
  known primitive has been really successful.
Evin:  useful so you know nft is our.
Evin: Launch.
<sharon_leu> But what about people who aren't even digitally 
  native? What is their onboarding experience?
Evin: Immutable intended to be transferable verifiable 
  credentials are private off chain revocable or can be set to 
  expire then subject to you know sharing in a course with a 
  consent and participation of the subject and so looking at 
  verifiable credentials as sort of an off chain encrypted payload 
  that can be presented and curated in the same way as in nft but 
  is specifically for more non-transferable traits that that that 
  hits.
Evin:  pretty well in perhaps.
<nate_otto_(badgr/csky)> Backpack: coming full circle to Open 
  Badges circa 2011
Evin: Terms I have started to refer to the combination of 
  decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials as a data 
  backpack your data backpack for the metaverse allowing you to be 
  an ownership and control of what comes with you allowing you to 
  you know choose from your backpack and disclose the information 
  that you want to share and that when you leave like items that 
  would carry you carry around in your backpack when you leave 
  those items come with you this assets come with you in addition.
Evin:  to that.
Evin: How.
Evin: Like hardcore nerds we have on this call though I feel like 
  I probably got a few of you here you might be familiar with live 
  action role playing or LARPing and so this sort of gamified 
  experience in real life kind of playing out playing out battles 
  with foam swords is also very similar to the experience that we 
  have in digital video games where you know as you're playing 
  through a video game you might have a satchel a loot bag a Loot 
  Crate.
Evin:  great somewhere that you can start to.
Evin: Here.
Simone Ravaoli: +1 To the BackPack metaphor
Evin: The valuable assets that you encounter as you play the game 
  as you go along and so at this Co we're saying that you know life 
  is a giant LARP a giant live action role play but without a loot 
  bag without somewhere for you to carry around the awesome data 
  that you're creating you create it and then you just have to 
  leave it in the context where it was produced you know subjecting 
  that data to centralized storage or Worse publication and a 
  public Ledger and so so in the same way that we can enjoy the 
  poor.
Evin:  debility.
Evin: On.
Evin: In tokens assets and cryptocurrencies we should be able to 
  enjoy similar portability for the rest of our data and that's 
  what a data backpack that's what I did and BC combo allows us to 
  enjoy as users Johnny I know that you're also very very deep in 
  the memes anything that that has hit that's not heading different 
  ways that we've started to think about this.
Jonny: Yeah so we have a form on our website right now that has a 
  field in it you use it to sign up for you know more information 
  on Disco it's you know we have a pretty basic site right now 
  until we get closer to our launch in April but in that form 
  there's a field that says share your metaverse dream right and 
  we've had a thousand responses just in the past month so far and 
  I've monitored them all I've read them all and the data backpack 
  comes.
Jonny:  up a lot.
Jonny: Like.
Jonny: That is the skeuomorphic thing that people seem at least 
  in the language that we floated has that that is seeming to stick 
  I totally agree with Evan know that you know it's something that 
  I've tried myself is of course since we are embedded in like the 
  very deep web 3 community and aetherium people and are at those 
  conferences and those are typically the people we're talking to 
  in Ft is the obvious reference point off chain and FTS like that 
  for people that are understand and FTS you see off chain and FTA.
Jonny:  and they maybe have a couple questions but at least they 
  have.
Jonny: You know they.
Jonny: It gets a little closer the thing that I've always talked 
  about with other people that seems to resonate in some user 
  interviews if they're familiar with crypto again this kind of is 
  a pretext for it which is lots of people are coming to understand 
  the way that in which Bitcoin or etherium allow you to do 
  digitally what you can do kind of physically which is the 
  transfer of you know cash you know hand-to-hand cash right like 
  aetherium and Bitcoin or you know trying to make.
Jonny:  that possible in.
<kerri_lemoie> @Evin & @Jonny - do you have a link to a slide 
  deck you can share?
Jonny: Ace we have the same type thing when we ever we use our 
  license at like let's say a bar right they scan your license a 
  physical object or you drop it in one of those little boxes that 
  that scan it or they use their light on it or whatever and none 
  of these things require the relying party or the bar in this 
  instance or the bouncer to call the Department of State or the 
  DMV or anything like that to know whether or not this credential 
  is real and so in this.
Jonny:  the same way that we've taken the physical interaction.
Jonny: And made it digital without needing a middle person we 
  want to do the same thing for all the other things that might be 
  in your wallet outside of your financial assets so that's been 
  something that when people call me and ask me to you know explain 
  disco to them like my friends you know back home that you know 
  I've heard about it that's the my go-to thing and that seems to 
  really close the gap and they're like oh you know that makes a 
  lot of sense I get how they already are kind of familiar with how 
  the.
Jonny:  the the promise of the crypto asset stuff and we're 
  simply saying this.
Jonny: An.
Jonny: Log but for all of the other things that would be in your 
  wallet so that's been relatively useful.
Simone Ravaoli:  Thank you Johnny thank you we have a question 
  from Sharon so what about people that are not digital native 
  what's your onboarding experience.
Evin: Great questions so of course you know we can't boil the 
  ocean and serve all people at all times just from Day Zero so to 
  begin as we work out the Kinks of you know deploying this this 
  ecosystem of capability our first set of users is existing web 
  three native wallet holders so folks who are already managing key 
  pairs already comfortable with the material compatible wallet 
  from there will be scaling up to incorporate other web 3 base 
  chain.
Evin:  seems like Bitcoin and Solana and once we feel.
Evin: Assured in the user experience that we are delivering being 
  you know on on par with the kinds of app and DEP experiences that 
  we would expect with Excellence then we will begin exploring 
  things like custodial options that will allow you to sign in with 
  a more a more basic identifiers looking username and password 
  however we think that the merits of you know having public 
  signing keys that that are you know on chain and able to execute 
  more.
Evin:  more than just signing off chain data we think putting 
  those in the hands of users.
Evin: Is critically important so our hope is that the user 
  experience and onboarding journey for what every will mature as 
  does discos and that you know we can meet somewhere in the middle 
  certainly a better a better user flow than we have today however 
  in thinking about those custodian experiences those experiences 
  that are relevant for users who may not be managing the existing 
  key pair or actually working with a variety of luxury web to 
  retail vendors retail brands that.
Evin:  that do not have web three meat of users but are excited.
Evin: Proofs of purchase receipts as verifiable credentials so 
  through working through that use case I think we'll get to a much 
  clearer definition of what an outstanding user flow can look like 
  but because we're not starting with a custodial option that will 
  definitely be something we explore a little bit later Johnny is 
  our sort of user experience and design wizard any further 
  thoughts on on how in the future we'll be exploring custodial 
  options.
Jonny: Yes oh I mean your point is well-taken onboarding non you 
  know web native people specially non even web three people is 
  quite the hurdle one that we've engaged with a lot you know we've 
  we've worked on you know in other SSI teams you know worked on 
  you know Refugee identity and citizen identity and a lot of these 
  things and key man.
Jonny: Mint is a.
Jonny: You however I guess from are just our road in terms of 
  adoption we think we can get our first I don't know million users 
  from people that already have you know that are already cut 
  studying their own Keys rights and so that's why we think right 
  now is a time that we can actually get a critical mass build a 
  business without having to engage with that problem yet and we 
  think you know when we worked on those problems.
Jonny:  the feedback.
Jonny: Bullseye.
Jonny: A lot of that stuff in the in the in the the 
  infrastructure that was available was just not the feedback 
  Cycles weren't fast enough and the maturation of the ux of many 
  of these wallets that we were asking these users to download 
  weren't great so we're taking a more stepwise approach where 
  we're trying to get credentials into the hands of people that 
  have shown that they are early adopters first and iterate there 
  it's kind of.
Jonny:  based on.
Jonny: Personally for me it's very much based on Clayton 
  christensen's disruption theory for back in the 90s where you 
  know the the assertion in that book is that one of the best ways 
  to to facilitate the emergence of a disruptive technology is to 
  look at small Niche audiences first and iterate very very quickly 
  there and so that's that's where we see the most fertile ground 
  for iteration without these other blockers but.
Jonny:  to the point.
Jonny: Of how do we finally cross that Chasm yeah I think that 
  there are some interesting work done by our friends at Spruce 
  with session Keys which are kind of like a femoral signing keys 
  that are that can be dids that allow you to log in maybe via a 
  regular oauth method and generate keys that are for that session 
  to be able to interact with credentials and do certain things and 
  then they are gone but there is a.
Jonny:  proof that.
Jonny: Um to show that any credential signed in the past by some 
  keys that are no longer existent we're still valid at the time 
  could be a bridge into making the experience feel like you're not 
  doing full on private Key Management back in the day at you port 
  we worked on some of the early research around social recovery 
  and even went as far as to do off chain social recovery using 
  Shamir.
Jonny:  and you know rather than like a smart contract based.
Jonny: Same thing and you know this was an attempt that I'd 
  really love to see disco or any other teams I bring it up in the 
  you know the diff calls as well like what is the current state of 
  the art and social recovery like has anybody really fully tried 
  to deploy the sergeant does it but they do it with the smart 
  contract which was our early design at you port but there's some 
  there's some problems with privacy and collusion and everything 
  there so I'd really love to see us do more experiments with that.
Jonny:  key recovery if we have.
Jonny: Fire.
Jonny: That are linked to human readable other human readable 
  identifiers like what we're trying to do a disco in which public 
  key can be verifiably linked to a Twitter account and domain and 
  all of these things I think we can actually create a good ux 
  around social or distributed recovery and that might help ease 
  the burden of actually getting somebody from zero to self 
  Sovereign and then finally you know.
Jonny:  there's there's.
Jonny: Did the D.C.'s offer the ability especially against just 
  dudes on their own offer the ability for us to rotate the 
  controlling keys of an identifier and so we could see that disco 
  custody being a did for the user and then when they are ready to 
  off-board out of discos management though they can still use our 
  interface for interacting with their data but they can rotate to 
  say they install metal mask and then they can they can make that 
  transfer happen you know revoking or.
Jonny:  essentially rotating.
Jonny: Out.
Jonny: Cisco managed keys to some keys that they manage when 
  there are ready and so that is a pattern that is likely going to 
  be on our radar for you know testing and implementation near the 
  end of this year.
<chris_kelly_(dif)> What a great session! Thanks Evin & Jonny
Simone Ravaoli:  All right awesome thanks again Johnny and Evan 
  we are coming up at the end of you know our session together and 
  I did put myself in the queue because I have a question that I 
  wanted to keep for last but just possibly more as a teaser for 
  something that we want to address more in the future and this is 
  the difference between n ftes and verifiable credentials so could 
  you in just a rapid-fire maybe give us you know what are the 
  three main differences between the twos.
Simone Ravaoli:  In like three minutes and then the call for 
  everyone.
Simone Ravaoli:  That we want to.
Simone Ravaoli:  Like more info about this conversation we have 
  already started and so we may have another similar session like 
  this where we just focus on this have been and Johnny just to 
  close out thank you.
Evin: Sure yeah one of my favorite things is a rapid-fire 
  comparison between did zandor between be seized and FTS so nft s 
  as we know are globally available public immutable transferable 
  assets when they're not transferable they diminish the autonomy 
  of their users by enabling for a token ID to be immutably mapped 
  to their public address without their consent and participation 
  it's verifiable credentials as we know are kind of the opposite 
  side.
Evin:  side of that coin they are.
Evin: Goodbye.
<kerri_lemoie> We won't get to use cases today. Doc here: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O98lt85PS8ozyMtKQMPdZPLnzpNI30bEgYH1Dq-C-IQ/edit#
Evin: False they can be revoked or be set to expire though they 
  can contain any data payload like an NF T is you are I can point 
  to anything they are non-transferable once they are issued and so 
  like a diploma once they're written about you they will always be 
  written about you even though the Json file can itself be 
  transferred the content cannot be migrated to describe a 
  different party they are revocable or can be set to expire and 
  can be disclosed.
Evin:  and whatever.
Evin: The subject prefers whether in plain text or you know it's 
  something like predicate disclosure that allows you to 
  interrogate a specific field without revealing that plain text I 
  think those are kind of the high points that I like to hit in 
  that comparison I always like to remind folks that did sign and 
  keys are also can also be rotated and so we have just greater 
  flexibility there than we do for your standard public identifier 
  Johnny is where sign of any other.
Evin:  any other comparisons that we'd like to draw here.
Jonny: Yeah I mean I think that there is a bit of a at least a 
  narrative arms race happening between in ftes and VCS so you know 
  first thing we point out and if T is transferable well then in Ft 
  Advocates come back with non-transferable enough teeth and we say 
  okay well then there you know the data is public and you're 
  putting Pi on chain well then they say will have the nft point to 
  some off chain resource and that will be in zero not you know 
  like a using a ZK scheme and it'll be you know private then we.
Jonny: Okay well you can't rotate away from.
Jonny: I was.
Jonny: If you need to route you know use new keys because you 
  know maybe your wallet at you think it might have been 
  compromised well did there will be implemented a standard that 
  allows the transferable the transfer of that nft only if some 
  other address can prove that there's a mutual ownership between 
  the first address in the next address so there's a bit of this 
  like I think and then you know then there's the conversations 
  around forward encryption guarantees into the future and then you 
  get into a conversation.
Jonny:  ation about Quantum.
Jonny: Distant you know encryption and these things so I think 
  that that's like where we are I think at a meta level for for us 
  we just think that the mft approach feels like a hack it feels 
  like we are taking something that was built for some other 
  purpose and trying to make it fit into the shape we want it to 
  where we have something that is in purpose-built to solve the 
  problem that you know other teams are trying to solve within FTS 
  now that doesn't mean.
Jonny:  in these seas are going.
Jonny: Does.
Jonny: Obviously mean that these are going to win of course Evan 
  and I think they will and we're going to you know help make we do 
  believe fundamentally that it should be these verses or you know 
  team should be using VCS rather than in FTS but yeah there is a 
  bit of a you know if you get if you start talking to somebody who 
  really is working on the nft side of this there are a lot of 
  theoretical answers for solving these problems and that's correct 
  that's the current state of the conversation as.
Jonny:  I've had it so far.
Simone Ravaoli:  Awesome I think there is probably you know one 
  thing that we can learn from and if T is as in the fast kind of 
  adoption or hype that has created maybe leading to adoption you 
  know so maybe it's a question around how they connect to your 
  identity and how expressive you could be with that so this is 
  again I kept this for last because I know we can go down this 
  rabbit hole for a long time we start to collect some feedbacks in 
  conversations even within the credentials committee.
Simone Ravaoli:  To group and that could be the base of something 
  that.
Simone Ravaoli:  Maybe we can.
Evin: That sounds great.
Simone Ravaoli:  Share with the public that helps to elevate or 
  inform the level of the conversation so you know happy if you 
  want to contribute to and this clearly is for everyone as well 
  here.
<chris_kelly_(dif)> :clap:
Jonny: One one one last comment I'll make than you know where 
  over time is that I think what in ft's have done that we have 
  maybe not focus too much on but we want to focus on It Disco is 
  the skeuomorphic nature of an ft's they feel like ownable objects 
  you can see them on screen you can show them to other people they 
  have a they sit in a box that feels tangible right and one of the 
  things.
Jonny: I think that that has why it's.
Jonny: Very.
Jonny: People.
<simone_ravaioli> like OpenBadges ... ;-)
Jonny: Sexualize VCS when they are simply Json blobs stored in 
  your apps storage or something like that and I think I know that 
  open Badges and things like this have tried to create these like 
  objects that you can see on screen that people can feel something 
  about and I think that that just what in FTS have done really 
  well they can display them in a gallery online as things that 
  they own right and this is the cognitive bridge I think.
Jonny:  we have to like.
Jonny: Really lean into with with VCS if we're going to compete 
  against that and ft narrative.
<taylor> Need function of VCs with culture of NFTs
Simone Ravaoli:  Lovely I like how we ended on that note I think 
  we've seen can hints of the genetic code of open badges coming 
  back into this conversation whether it's the backpack whether 
  it's you know this Cube morphic nature of this kind of 
  credentials and it's good thing that part of the work.
Simone Ravaoli:  We're doing here.
<evin> Thank you all so much for having us! Looking forward to 
  working together :)
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks!!
Jonny: Great thanks for asking.
Simone Ravaoli:  Lee also informing the next version of open 
  badges which is going to be a very viable credentials and that's 
  really like a clear outcome that we have here so well thanks for 
  sharing your story glad to be on this journey together again good 
  luck with this girl I guess see on the dance floor and look for 
  looking forward to have you back here again tell us some updates 
  or maybe diving to the end of T versus verifiable initials 
  question all right so.
<chris_kelly_(dif)> thanks all!
Simone Ravaoli:   So yeah awesome awesome.
Simone Ravaoli:  I'm sorry.
<kerri_lemoie> I'll follow up with an email.
Simone Ravaoli:  I guess we took a few minutes to go over time we 
  were supposed to briefly review the use cases carry as drop the 
  link in the chat but it's the same link would pick that up next 
  week and lovely awesome thanks again having thanks again Johnny 
  thank you everyone see you next week.
Kerri Lemoie:  I think so.
Kerri Lemoie:  And somebody don't forget to turn off the 
  recording.
Kerri Lemoie:  Excellent thank you.
