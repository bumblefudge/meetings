<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="information">Evin: About disco as it will be introduced to the world in early April but we see a really exciting opportunity for verifiable credentials to provide the Firepower from which web 3 in the crypto ecosystem can you know can get its power we&apos;re seeing right now that there is a surge of desire to work in the crypto and web three ecosystem and that because there&apos;s not a lot of formal education available around. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="information">Evin: See many different you know diverse credentialing issuers many organizations that are providing some of this guidance but very few ways for a user an individual to accrue that expertise proofs of their learning and expertise in a rapid manner that allows them to share that expertise in those proofs with a potential employer a decentralized autonomous organization that they want to be part of or some other entity or group creating content. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="information">Evin: So we think that there is a really exciting chance for us to insert verifiable credentials into this process and to enable the web three education ecosystem the crypto education ecosystem to issue these credentials at a high velocity and to enable users to present them with similar speed and validity and so you know as we talked about like what are the killer use cases what are the use cases with high velocity. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="information">Evin: And for credential issuance and high velocity of demand for credential verification we see this sort of as a perfect storm and so to talk a little bit more about how how disco as a product offering and you know set of apis and sdks will begin to enable this universe I&apos;ll hand it over to Johnny to share a little bit more about our product Vision overall and then more specifically how we&apos;re thinking about initial use cases. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
