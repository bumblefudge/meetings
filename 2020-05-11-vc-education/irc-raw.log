[2020-05-11T15:41:06.167Z]	<Joshua_Marks>	WIll the deck be available?
[2020-05-11T15:41:24.721Z]	<kimhd>	it has a "download" link

[2020-05-11T15:41:31.707Z]	<chriswinc>	... how long should the verification within the presentation be trusted, subject to revocation?
[2020-05-11T15:42:00.481Z]	<HansPongratz>	present+
[2020-05-11T15:42:38.317Z]	<chriswinc>	anthonycamilleri: Validity of credential 2-3 years based on certificate. Presentation is valid for as long as the person wants to share it - tied to expiry date they set.
[2020-05-11T15:43:04.709Z]	<chriswinc>	ottonomy: how does this work over the 40 year goal?
[2020-05-11T15:44:12.406Z]	<chriswinc>	anthonycamilleri: there is a maximum of 7 year validity, this requires XML. They would like recipients to be able to download and store for 40 years.
[2020-05-11T15:45:03.518Z]	<chriswinc>	... eIDAS constrains the length but this is being worked on as well

[2020-05-11T15:46:03.023Z]	<by_caballero>	qualified?
[2020-05-11T15:46:06.310Z]	<by_caballero>	substantial?
[2020-05-11T15:46:18.180Z]	<by_caballero>	these are the terms used most commonly for the eIDAS levels of assurance
[2020-05-11T15:46:24.811Z]	<chriswinc>	kimhd: Applying SSI to eIDAS link above
[2020-05-11T15:46:29.927Z]	<by_caballero>	also signed versus sealed :D
[2020-05-11T15:46:57.616Z]	<chriswinc>	... what implications does this have on credential repositories? Pass-through or long-term storage?
[2020-05-11T15:47:41.278Z]	<chriswinc>	anthonycamilleri: very active research into SSI within eIDAS, would be surprised if this came in a binding way within 5 years.
[2020-05-11T15:47:49.404Z]	<by_caballero>	<breaks out into tears at the estimate of having to wait 5 years for eIDAS updates>
[2020-05-11T15:48:28.056Z]	<chriswinc>	... EDCI viewer can only be used online now, looking into offline usage
[2020-05-11T15:49:19.502Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-05-11T15:49:19.845Z]	<chriswinc>	kimhd: agree with the SSI eDIAS time estimate.
[2020-05-11T15:49:23.162Z]	<kimhd>	ack kimhd
[2020-05-11T15:49:30.543Z]	<kimhd>	ack by_caballero
[2020-05-11T15:49:43.484Z]	<chriswinc>	by_caballero: inaudible
[2020-05-11T15:50:04.827Z]	<ottonomy>	by_caballero's connection was very good right up until the beginning of the question. Alas!
[2020-05-11T15:50:30.671Z]	<by_caballero>	blarg
[2020-05-11T15:51:09.887Z]	<by_caballero>	I just wanted to hear more about the revocation infrastructure-- 1 per issuer? 1 for all of europe? something in between? any specifics?
[2020-05-11T15:52:10.624Z]	<chriswinc>	kimhd: I like that you started with the Data Model. Maybe we can start with Data Models that include XML. What are your highest priority items?
[2020-05-11T15:52:48.018Z]	<chriswinc>	anthonycamilleri: Data Model is high priority, would appreciate namespace for VCs that are XML
[2020-05-11T15:52:58.165Z]	<chriswinc>	kimhd: please clarify "namespace"
[2020-05-11T15:53:16.247Z]	<chriswinc>	anthonycamilleri: clarification that XML is an official VC
[2020-05-11T15:53:27.842Z]	<chriswinc>	... would be helpful
[2020-05-11T15:53:43.876Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-05-11T15:53:50.807Z]	<chriswinc>	question from by_caballero
[2020-05-11T15:54:04.083Z]	<chriswinc>	... revocation above
[2020-05-11T15:54:13.363Z]	<by_caballero>	you're in good company when it comes to that particular embarassment!
[2020-05-11T15:54:44.924Z]	<chriswinc>	anthonycamilleri: will launch revocation structure this summer. EU will maintain its own revocation list for Europass, will also allow member states to have their own revocation lists
[2020-05-11T15:55:06.900Z]	<chriswinc>	... for example, a court could publish a revocation list
[2020-05-11T15:55:36.731Z]	<chriswinc>	... issuers can themselves point to a revocation list within the credential
[2020-05-11T15:55:40.607Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-05-11T15:57:07.449Z]	<chriswinc>	kimhd: Within VC data model, the URI is being used as an identifier. How are you approaching identity with this implementation? DID-web...
[2020-05-11T15:57:50.289Z]	<chriswinc>	anthonycamilleri: Current version - eIDAS provides a scheme for identifiers for legal and natural persons
[2020-05-11T15:58:42.900Z]	<chriswinc>	... relevant data for each person type published in URI (not dereferencable)
[2020-05-11T15:59:20.464Z]	<chriswinc>	... would like to be able to offer DIDs that are linked to eIDAS
[2020-05-11T15:59:59.741Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-05-11T16:00:03.596Z]	<chriswinc>	kimhd: outreach is compelling though this approach
[2020-05-11T16:00:08.901Z]	<by_caballero>	thank you so much!
[2020-05-11T16:00:11.996Z]	<larinyo>	Hi Kim (and all) - relevant link on how to link SSI-VC with the eIdas trust framework is available at https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge
[2020-05-11T16:00:31.797Z]	<Joshua_Marks>	Thank you
[2020-05-11T16:00:37.742Z]	<chriswinc>	... Will follow up on the possible work item. Thank you Anthony!
