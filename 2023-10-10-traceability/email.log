Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Benjamin Collins:  Cats recording we have the CG but we also have 
  the auto transcriber.
Benjamin Collins:  Do you want to have a in scrap or do you want 
  to let the machine do its evil thing.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  I think we should I can Skype if you'd like 
  me to.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi is scribing.
Benjamin Collins:  It's the right one.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  We'll do a shortened call today, going 
  through PRs
Benjamin Collins: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/pulls
Benjamin Collins: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/pull/597
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc
Chris Abernethy:  Vocab or Interop?
Chris Abernethy:  Adds a negative conformance test, that makes 
  sure that if you try to issue a credential with a duplicate key, 
  a 400 should be returned
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Actually passing this test is quite 
  difficult as body-parser and most json parsing libraries end up 
  silently dropping all duplicate terms excep tthe last one
Chris Abernethy:  That wasn't clear on the issue, maybe we should 
  modify it to allow 400 or simply use last duplicate key
Chris Abernethy:  Noting that on the PR
Benjamin Collins: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/pull/600
Benjamin Collins:  Moving to PR 600 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/pull/600
Orie Steele:  This updates current state, but is not in line with 
  latest changes. Its fine as is because it fixes an error
Orie Steele:  Left a suggested change, once applied should be 
  changed
Benjamin Collins: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/pull/886
Benjamin Collins:  Not merging on call, will merge out of band
Benjamin Collins:  This PR removes shipping stop that is no 
  logner in use, seems straight forward
Chris Abernethy:  There are two additions to the openapi.yaml, is 
  it intended in this PR?
Benjamin Collins: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/blob/main/docs/openapi/components/schemas/credentials/DCSAShippingInstructionCredential.yml
Benjamin Collins: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/blob/main/docs/openapi/components/schemas/credentials/DigitalProductPassportDataCarrierCredential.yml
Orie Steele:  Seems someone didn't commit those autogenerated 
  updates, a previous PR was merged without those changes happening
Benjamin Collins:  Attached the two credentials lookslike it just 
  slipped in previous PR.
Benjamin Collins: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab/pull/888
Benjamin Collins:  Next one is straightforward it just changes 
  one file, where the ID was incorrect
Benjamin Collins:  If theres anything on interop we can go 
  through that too
Benjamin Collins:  Ending meeting now
