[2021-09-28T20:13:12.324Z]	<mprorock>	big thanks to Eric and Joe on this
[2021-09-28T20:13:15.932Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: i've noticed in last half hour theres a thing missing i'll get to
[2021-09-28T20:13:41.150Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: each of the participants who are in a different trust domain have different colours
[2021-09-28T20:13:56.241Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: messages that cross these boundaries need authz
[2021-09-28T20:14:15.156Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: often these are "i only accept access from localhost"
[2021-09-28T20:14:36.319Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: we are identifying where we need to talk about authz
[2021-09-28T20:16:11.212Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: emerging definition for service and app. the distinction between server, app and role. roles: holder, verifier, issuer. different components: app is software or service that gives vc-enabling capability (often SaaS)
[2021-09-28T20:16:25.319Z]	<Michael_Herman_(Trusted_Digital_Web)>	Role -> Actor
[2021-09-28T20:16:52.981Z]	<Michael_Herman_(Trusted_Digital_Web)>	Roles are not actors in most formal modeling metamodels
[2021-09-28T20:16:55.690Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... service is only accessable by the app
[2021-09-28T20:17:15.549Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	I like this direction...
[2021-09-28T20:17:27.597Z]	<Michael_Herman_(Trusted_Digital_Web)>	Actors are assigned to Roles but Actors are the only entities that perform actions.
[2021-09-28T20:17:29.814Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... we have previously conflated the role and app and this is separated now
[2021-09-28T20:17:53.065Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	ack michael
[2021-09-28T20:17:53.523Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	it seems like the Verifier Storage Service doesn't add much to the diagram. (plus, many verifiers won't be storing the VC, etc)

[2021-09-28T20:18:20.845Z]	<Brian_Richter>	michael: role could be changed to actor? formal document should use formal definitions
[2021-09-28T20:18:26.265Z]	<Orie>	> holder
A role an entity might perform by possessing one or more verifiable credentials and generating verifiable presentations from them. Example holders include students, employees, and customers.
[2021-09-28T20:18:55.897Z]	<Michael_Herman_(Trusted_Digital_Web)>	These are personas
[2021-09-28T20:19:07.481Z]	<Brian_Richter>	david chadwick: in the model we've got we differentiate between application layer and VC layer. when we talk about app that could be browser on mobile phone or 3rd party banking app which talks to holder app. on relying party side we have service provider which will talk to the service
[2021-09-28T20:19:09.707Z]	<mprorock>	orie is quoting the spec here https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders

[2021-09-28T20:20:17.580Z]	<Juan_(Spherity_GmbH)>	might be a good topic for the VC-GUIDE :D
[2021-09-28T20:20:19.330Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: we're using the term "role" since it's in the vc data model
[2021-09-28T20:20:31.705Z]	<Juan_(Spherity_GmbH)>	(and/or for issues for VC spec v2)
[2021-09-28T20:20:38.955Z]	<Brent>	so, the "holder role" label should be understood to mean "an actor in a holder role?"
[2021-09-28T20:20:39.782Z]	<agropper>	q+
[2021-09-28T20:20:42.269Z]	<Brian_Richter>	michael: i don't disagree with that wording but in this diagram you need to depict an actor

[2021-09-28T20:20:54.713Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: we are indicating this role is the actor ie. holder
[2021-09-28T20:21:17.270Z]	<Brian_Richter>	dmitri: would it simplify the diagram to remove verifier storage service?

[2021-09-28T20:21:34.349Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: it would but the storage service and revocation service are both underrepresented right now

[2021-09-28T20:23:12.768Z]	<Brian_Richter>	adrian: i understand the role of holder and issuer are separate roles but from authz perspective they could be combined in some instances. when we have distinction between device bound identity and biometric bound identity the opportunity arises for combining issuer and holder as theres no need for device bound identity
[2021-09-28T20:23:33.613Z]	<Michael_Herman_(Trusted_Digital_Web)>	q-
[2021-09-28T20:23:36.355Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... when liveness is required that can also fit into authz protocol

[2021-09-28T20:24:15.030Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... where the resource owner needs to be in control of authz policies instead of storage that is where my perspective is
[2021-09-28T20:24:31.056Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: slight shift in language might help me understand
[2021-09-28T20:25:18.678Z]	<Orie>	this picture does not include Issuer... it assumes that the holder already has a VC... we don't care how that happened.
[2021-09-28T20:25:37.092Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... any entity may be in any role at any time. that flexibility is innate. any of these services could be monolithic. reality is for our API important things are where do we provide APIs that can have substitutability

[2021-09-28T20:27:09.128Z]	<mprorock>	with a big caveat that we are talking system to system use cases here
[2021-09-28T20:27:38.016Z]	<Brian_Richter>	adrian: i understand substitutability give challenges across trust domains. when discussing issues around delegation it would be helpful to our conversation if we considered when substitutability is important from a human rights vs vendor lock in
[2021-09-28T20:27:43.365Z]	<Orie>	i'm not sure why we are allowing the unrelated conversations to persist in this work...its confusing and harmful.

[2021-09-28T20:29:34.734Z]	<Orie>	Imagine a CRON Job that shares data between 2 web servers...
[2021-09-28T20:29:39.286Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	q+ to note that 1-6 feels like "Start Workflow" use case.
[2021-09-28T20:29:51.198Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... 1. holder starts up their app, 2. app decides we need to send a VP, 3. notifies verifier data ready
[2021-09-28T20:30:02.049Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... 4 evaluates what to do w/ that
[2021-09-28T20:30:16.023Z]	<Brian_Richter>	5. constructs a data package (domain and challenge)
[2021-09-28T20:30:41.439Z]	<mprorock>	+1 manu - that is a pretty good way of thinking about it
[2021-09-28T20:30:42.761Z]	<Brian_Richter>	Holder gets VC
[2021-09-28T20:30:54.739Z]	<Brian_Richter>	(from storage service)
[2021-09-28T20:31:31.145Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... app needs some notion of its own keys to invoke their actions
[2021-09-28T20:31:40.251Z]	<Orie>	not sure why we are talking about other CCG work items like web KMS... that work item is not required.
[2021-09-28T20:31:47.033Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... signs vp, sends to verfier app
[2021-09-28T20:32:00.209Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... verifier app talks to it's verifier service
[2021-09-28T20:32:18.326Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... verification comes back, verifier app evaluates business rules

[2021-09-28T20:32:37.423Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... stores the VC (may not be relevant but for symmetry)
[2021-09-28T20:32:43.965Z]	<mprorock>	@orie - agreed, basically some key management - not a specific one or protocol
[2021-09-28T20:32:53.705Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... holder app gets message back "we got presentation"
[2021-09-28T20:32:58.922Z]	<Orie>	I like to model this as 2 network requests between 2 web servers, where they are started by a cron job.
[2021-09-28T20:33:03.013Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... holder app records submission
[2021-09-28T20:33:17.385Z]	<Orie>	revocation status is not relevant or needed.
[2021-09-28T20:33:22.749Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... something that came up: who is doing revocation status check? i think should be verifier service
[2021-09-28T20:33:30.093Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	@orie @mprorock -- I believe JoeA was just using WebKMS as an example of key management, not a requirement.
[2021-09-28T20:33:49.629Z]	<Orie>	yes he was, its not required... nor is revocation.
[2021-09-28T20:33:52.082Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... i think we need another loop in here to show who is going to check revocation status

[2021-09-28T20:38:16.235Z]	<Orie>	all the VP flows are similar
[2021-09-28T20:38:29.525Z]	<Orie>	since they all require getting a domain and challenge from the verifier.
[2021-09-28T20:38:30.298Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: one of the shifts here is notification data ready describes data to be required

[2021-09-28T20:39:50.452Z]	<Brian_Richter>	adrian: in supply chain flow, difference between VP and VC is liveness detection a concept or is it assumed that there is none but only detection of holder that is meant to be the difference
[2021-09-28T20:40:08.707Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... you can sign a challenge w/ liveness or just by signing
[2021-09-28T20:40:38.369Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: that is the primary difference, i wish the supply chain had anchored the VP to the current user but that is not how it has been fleshed out

[2021-09-28T20:40:50.281Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: problem domain does not contain liveness detection

[2021-09-28T20:40:59.391Z]	<Orie>	it turns out that APIs exchange data... without people being detected as being alive, or involved.
[2021-09-28T20:41:17.905Z]	<Brian_Richter>	mpro: that is the individual flow
[2021-09-28T20:41:22.449Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	I think it might be worth clarifying that VPs only need challenge & domain when used for authentication. But not really for other purposes.
[2021-09-28T20:41:36.730Z]	<Brian_Richter>	adrian: there is difference between supply chain and general VP use case
[2021-09-28T20:41:45.968Z]	<Brian_Richter>	manu: what are next steps?
[2021-09-28T20:42:16.318Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: there are some iterations. 1. revocation check. 2. refresh check
[2021-09-28T20:42:32.639Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: our flows don't show where those things happen currently
[2021-09-28T20:42:54.266Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... working through an updated CHAPI flow using this language. should give us an architectural diagram
[2021-09-28T20:43:05.730Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... we are close to having something spec ready
[2021-09-28T20:43:23.845Z]	<Brian_Richter>	manu: thanks to people who did this work
[2021-09-28T20:43:47.409Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... is there anything to do w/ CHAPI flow?
[2021-09-28T20:44:22.544Z]	<Orie>	here is the flow with lots of abstraction:

(company 1 service) -> (company 2 service)
(company 1 service)  <- (company 2 service)

// holder has domain and challenge

(company 1 service) -> (company 2 service)
(company 1 service)  <- (company 2 service)

// verifier has VP
[2021-09-28T20:44:30.009Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: same sort of walkthrough and look at differences. how are we going to talk about authz at these levels. often holder authenticates to app using email
[2021-09-28T20:44:47.873Z]	<Brian_Richter>	joe: lets do chapi and that can flow into how are these layers secured
[2021-09-28T20:45:05.347Z]	<Brian_Richter>	manu: PRs is next item
[2021-09-28T20:45:08.066Z]	<mprorock>	traditional enterprise API use cases for VCs is basically what we are dealing with to expand on Orie's comment

[2021-09-28T20:50:38.510Z]	<Brian_Richter>	adrian: i don't think we're ready to talk about this because: 1. we can not reply to a human rights argument using economic reasons. 2. not sure what is impossible, for example UMA we built delegation onto OAuth
[2021-09-28T20:50:54.863Z]	<Justin_Richer>	Orie then you have bad tools 🤷‍♀️
[2021-09-28T20:51:08.880Z]	<Brian_Richter>	... we need to have human rights conversation in regards to delegation
[2021-09-28T20:51:09.540Z]	<mprorock>	that is fine, but let's take that to the mailing list, not this work item for now
[2021-09-28T20:51:21.311Z]	<Justin_Richer>	Also, I adapted it to do just that, since it's open source. It just doesn't allow plugins because of the software design.

[2021-09-28T20:52:33.926Z]	<TallTed>	"very difficult, very expensive" are sufficient arguments against doing a SHOULD. it need not be "impossible"
[2021-09-28T20:52:33.959Z]	<Orie>	ZCAPs are also  not a standard and also not supported by OAS3.0.
