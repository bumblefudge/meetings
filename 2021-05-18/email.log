Topic: Introductions and Reintroductions

Markus Sabadello: Pchampin: I'm W3C fellow, part of the W3C team, 
  been involved in a lot of semantic web standardization, member of 
  several working groups such as JSON-LD 1.1. I've worked with Ivan 
  on charter for the Linked Data Signatures working group.
Wayne Chang:  We have a lot to talk about regarding Linked Data 
  Signatures (LDS) [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]

Topic: Announcements and Reminders

Topic: Review of Community Issues

Wayne Chang:  I believe there have been no community issues that 
  were blocked. I believe outstanding issues have been met, and 
  that we can move on. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]

Topic: Linked Data Signatures

Manu Sporny: Here's the email with the slide deck for today: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021May/0082.html
Manu Sporny:  I sent a slide deck to the community group. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny: Here's a direct archived link to the slide deck: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021May/att-0082/2021-Linked-Data-Security-WG-Charter.pdf
Manu Sporny:  I will be presenting (sharing screen). [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We're reviewing the LDS charter today. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We have been working on RDF canonicalization, LD 
  proofs, etc. in this CG and others. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  This is fundamental underpinning of Verifiable 
  Credentials [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We are doing this in "reverse order". In an ideal 
  world, this would have happened before VCs. But we are on a very 
  good path to get this standardized. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  The work has been done for a while, a draft charter 
  has been created. It went out in a "pre-circulation", before an 
  official vote. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Today we're going over where we are with the 
  charter. We are at the final stages of this pre-review stage 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We have input from a variety of organizations, 
  large and small. We had people from this community weigh in. 
  We'll go over it and answer questions. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Today we cover roadmap, and each work item listed 
  in the charter, and then things that are out of scope. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We have found items that are out of scope that 
  would have resulted in objections to the charter. [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Any other topics people want covered? [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We did a presentation what LDS are a couple of 
  months ago. This current slide deck has that in the appendix, 
  incl. e.g. examples of LD proofs, canonicalization, etc. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Showing roadmap on screen. The shape hasn't changed 
  that much [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We're talking about standardizing three things 
  described in the roadmap, everything else (e.g. specific 
  cryptosuites, BBS+) is out of scope. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We want a strongly focused charter. [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Expectation is that the WG will launch in 
  September. We're now circulating the charter, then we'll get a 
  final review from TAG and other W3C groups, and then there will 
  be a membership vote. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Typically you look at ~25 companies supporting the 
  charter, otherwise there will not be a WG. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Therefore, don't forget to vote for the charter. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Showing three bars on the roadmap slide: RDF 
  Dataset Normalization, Linked Data Signatures, Linked Data 
  Proofs. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We tried to make it very clear what the work items 
  are (showing in green on a slide). Others (shown in gray) are out 
  of scope, but could come later and we need to prepare for it. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  The group should make sure it doesn't accidentally 
  prevent the future work items from happening later. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
<jeffo-stl> Go Markus!
Manu Sporny:  The deliverables for LDS WG are RDF Dataset 
  Canonicalization, RDF Dataset Hash, and Linked Data Integrity & 
  Linked Data Security Vocabulary. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We do have use cases and requirements documents. 
  High-level, not detailed. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Documented use cases that came up during the review 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Charles E. Lehner: 
  https://w3c.github.io/lds-wg-charter/explainer.html
Manu Sporny:  Some use cases: Secret confirmation of the contents 
  of datasets, Annotating datasets with digital signatures, 
  Anchoring datasets to distributed ledgers, Naming blank nodes in 
  RDF datasets, Constrained data transfer, Semantic consistency of 
  multi-part datasets (being able to sign subsets of graphs), 
  Digitally signing ontologies [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Many other use cases exist that are variations of 
  the above [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Wayne Chang:  I was wondering if the following was in scope: 
  Often we want someone to sign something, but there is no 
  canonical way to explain what they are signing. Have you thought 
  about this? [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Markus Sabadello: Pchampin: There were are a lot of questions on 
  the semantic web list about similar questions. I think we agreed 
  that this would be considered out-of-scope. Obviously those 
  issues need to be addressed, but the WG is merely to provide 
  building blocks for this kind of thing. Linked Data Integrity 
  (LDI) Framework would be extensible to express e.g. social 
  meaning or commitment.
Manu Sporny:  Wayne could you explain a specific use cases that 
  elaborates on your questions? [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Wayne Chang:  One example is: there are a lot of users with 
  browser extensions that have private keys. How to get someone to 
  sign something with those keys? We could defined a LD signature 
  suite, but in order to sign it they may face canonicalized RDF 
  which is not user friendly. You still want to provide some sense 
  of what users are signing. We couldn't find anything for doing 
  that. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Effectively that's out of scope, you're at the 
  application layer where you are dealing with customers/users. The 
  WG is working on a lower leverl. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  This is where a number of companies that said this 
  could be a very big discussion, and you don't want the WG to 
  start this discussion. You want to build the foundation first. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Wayne I think there is no proposal on how to do 
  that. How does an individual know what they sign is an old 
  problem. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  You could work on an open source spec or work item, 
  which could become in scope in the future. This is a good example 
  of the kind of concerns companies have had. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  When it comes to the meaning of things to be 
  signed, it can become very complex. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Orie Steele: Signing `@json` :)
Mike Prorock:  This is dealing specifically with signing of RDF. 
  A common thing for us is representing properties and metadata of 
  non-LD in some kind of LD format. We like this, e.g. change 
  detection, tamper resistance. Is the WG going to touch on 
  conversion of tabular and other data? How do we represent that as 
  Linked Data? [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  That is another thing we struggled with. A lot of 
  engagement came from the semantic web community. A number of us 
  fought hard to make sure those things are not considered out of 
  scope. In LD, you can use @json. You can use JCS to put something 
  in a Linked Data payload. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  If you have CVS or tabular data, you have to find a 
  way to express it in LD, e.g. use a text blob. It's not ideal but 
  okay. Just to be clear, that is out of scope. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Real thing that needs to be standardized is RDF 
  canonicalization, let's focus on that rather than canonicalizing 
  other things. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Balance in the charter is about RDF 
  canonicalization, but also consider that there may be other 
  canonicalization mechanisms out there. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
<orie> sounds like yes to JSON, no to other formats that don't 
  have a canonical form.... but don't block it....
<manu_sporny> effectively, yes, Orie.
Mike Prorock:  That helps quite a bit, we get these discussions 
  in the machine learning community. If we can get this 
  standardized, that gives us the means to work on other 
  mechanisms. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Balance in the charter is about not overwhelming 
  the WG, and not preventing future work. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
<wayne_chang> JCS is pretty widely implemented
Manu Sporny:  There is an explainer document that goes with the 
  charter. Talks about the general problems to be addressed. Talks 
  about why we split out hashing from signing, about separation of 
  concerns, out-of-scope items, and use cases. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  When you read the charter, also read the explainer. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Let's talk now about actual deliverables. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Great news is we have 2 co-chairs, Phil Archer and 
  Markus Sabadello [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Dave Longley: +1 Great chair choices
Manu Sporny:  I'm thrilled by those choices. Both have accepted. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Ivan is going to be team contact. Pierre-Antoine is 
  going to be in the group as well. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Markus Sabadello:  I'm equally excited, relatively recently that 
  I was asked to co-chair. Not as deep into the subject as I will 
  be. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
<orie> thank you Markus and Phil!
Markus Sabadello:  This is important work, it was interesting how 
  Manu mentioned how it was done in the wrong order, we've been 
  taking this for granted for a long time, but the reason why this 
  is important is because it's not just for Verifiable Credentials 
  [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
Markus Sabadello:  It's for other datasets as well, we already 
  see other examples in other communities that are using this for 
  things that are not Verifiable Credentials, this is really 
  broader, new trust and security layer for the Web itself, for the 
  semantic web. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
Markus Sabadello:  I'm looking forward to this work and seeing 
  people participate from here. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
Manu Sporny:  Phil is also ex-W3C, now pushing this agenda at 
  GS1. We got a lot of experience coming into the group. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
<wayne_chang> yes, thanks for chairing. ya'll are pushing the 
  ecosystem forward in foundational ways
Manu Sporny:  First deliverable: Technical Report of RDF dataset 
  canonicalization. How do you canonicalize the RDF abstract data 
  structure. There are two inputs to this group, one by Dave 
  Longley and Rachel Arnold, and then a mathematical proof by Aidan 
  Hogan. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  There are two independent proofs that this is a 
  solvable problem, this is a good signal to the group. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  This problem has existed for 20+ years [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Second deliverable: RDF Dataset Hash. Once you have 
  this canonical form, how do you generate a hash? Right now, this 
  is in the LD Proofs specification, but people want us to separate 
  that from the Linked Data Integrity specification. It might be a 
  short work item. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Third and Fourth: Linked Data Integrity and Linked 
  Data Vocabulary. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<mprorock> integrity is way better than proof imho
Manu Sporny:  Linked Data Integrity is basically a new name of 
  Linked Data Signatures and Linked Data Proofs. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  This covers anything from blockchain anchoring, to 
  digital signatures, to proof of work. These are general 
  algorithms for generating and attaching a proof. The RDF 
  vocabulary expressed the types of proofs you are creating. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  It's about how do you express signatures, proofs, 
  etc. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  There was controversy about proof of work. Feedback 
  from larger companies was we shouldn't work on things that "melt 
  the planet". W3C has a position that the web should be 
  sustainable, shouldn't contribute to social and environmental 
  destruction. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Phil Long: +1 To sustainability as a guideline.
Manu Sporny:  There is great concern about proof of work. If this 
  becomes the mechanism to protect integrity, there is concern W3C 
  may be doing active damage to the world. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  This is part of a larger conversation. I think this 
  is one of the first charters where environmental concerns were 
  raised. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Ryan Grant:  The "melt the planet" things is a ridiculous urban 
  legend. The value here is huge. I'm shocked that this is actually 
  being considered by people that are trying to do technical things 
  well. There is a recent report that the functionality is being 
  delivered at half the cost of banking and mining gold. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
<orie> manu, instead of saying big companies don't like PoW... 
  maybe you meant big companies care about the environment and want 
  to signal that in the charter?
Manu Sporny:  This is an active debate, it's interesting that the 
  charter triggered it. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Orie Steele:  I'm not sure what you are alluding to. I get 
  concerned when people mention large concerns. I wouldn't be 
  surprised if folks at large companies are interested in signaling 
  support for diversity and environmental considerations. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
<mprorock> small companies are also a big fan of avoiding excess 
  energy creation, consumption, and sourcing
Manu Sporny:  Someone from Google felt this should be brought up 
  with TAG. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  This isn't going to result in anything significant 
  in the charter. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Orie Steele: For reference, 
  https://sustainability.google/progress/projects/traceability/
<orie> "Supply chain meets blockchain for end-to-end mineral 
  tracking"
Manu Sporny:  The way how this work is structured in a way that 
  makes this avoidable. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Other potential deliverables: A Linked Data 
  Security Registry. Note on additional Linked Data Integrity 
  techniques that are not necessarily relying on the specifications 
  developed by the WG. This could enable other ways of 
  canonicalization that the WG should not prevent. [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Also primer, test suite, implementation guide. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Out of scope: Not going to define new cryptographic 
  signature/encryption algorithms. This should be done by focused 
  organizations. We will just define the usage of that work. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Also out of scope: Authenticity and trust issues 
  that go beyond simple factual data. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
<orie> I would call that "Software supply chain attacks 
  considered out of scope"
Manu Sporny:  The "meaning" of things is an important thing we 
  should consider. Changing semantics can be a problem. But this is 
  already being addressed elsewhere (e.g. always cache JSON-LD 
  context rather than loading it from the network). [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  That's where we are. If there is no more feedback, 
  that is the charter that will go to W3C and be voted on. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Any concerns from this community about anything you 
  saw? [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Wayne Chang:  Can I get further clarification on the relationship 
  between LDS WG and various existing work in IETF such as JCS, 
  JOSE? Are we planning to engage with those? [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Ryan Grant: PoW defense link #1: http://squ.re/BCEI-whitepaper
Manu Sporny:  IETF specs are meant to be referenced directly, and 
  we just use them. Anything that IETF has already defined we will 
  just use as-is. JCS and JOSE are done, so the W3C group can just 
  link to that work. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  To be clear, we are not working on any specific 
  cryptosuites. The WG will be aware of it and will ensure that the 
  foundations happen. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  With things like JOSE, proof of work, etc. there is 
  no expectation that the WG will put significant work into that. 
  Maybe in future iterations of the WG. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Ryan Grant: PoW defense link #2: 
  https://www.coindesk.com/frustrating-maddening-all-consuming-bitcoin-energy-debate
Manu Sporny:  We will work on green boxes (showing slide 4), not 
  on gray boxes. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Wayne Chang:  If someone says "I want to canonicalize JSON by 
  ordering fields, then I will sign via JWT, this works fine for my 
  use cases.". What would you reply that LDS will provide beyond 
  that? [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  So you canonicalize with JCS and sign JWT, at that 
  point you are outside of the LDS specs. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  It is possible to create a LD suite that uses JWS 
  internally, and people have done that. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
<orie> Workday and Consensus have used JCS like that.
<orie> obviously JOSE is also "locked into json"
Manu Sporny:  The biggest problem is that you are locked into 
  JSON, you have to transmit the JSON as-is. That works for a set 
  of use cases, but won't work if you want to use other formats, 
  e.g. do CBOR-LD compression. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  LDS allows you to transform into other data 
  formats, witout having to preserve the initial content that you 
  signed. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<orie> the key difference between "information" and "information 
  serialization"
Manu Sporny:  JOSE approach assumes everybody just uses JSON, 
  which is not true for some use cases. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  You can convert to a different format that can go 
  to RDF dataset and back. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Orie Steele: Only possible because RDF is an abstract data model 
  :)
<dave_longley> LDI (Linked Data Integrity) w/RDF canonicalization 
  doesn't lock your signatures to JSON, you can translate to other 
  syntaxes without losing your signatures (different syntaxes are 
  helpful for different use cases, e.g., expressing data in QR 
  codes) -- that's the difference.
Manu Sporny:  This it not theoretical, there are real use cases 
  today where we are talking about translating VCs from JSON-LD to 
  CBOR-LD and back, without storing payload. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Wayne Chang:  So you are not locked into JSON, you might evolve 
  into a higher being :) [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
