<div class="comment-continuation">... the meeting infra we&apos;re talking about now took a lot of effort and will continue to take effort to maintain</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... how can we resource this in temrs of time and finance?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so chairs can be freed up to focus on other priorities</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the task force is an attempt at an inclusive way to address this</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you&apos;re interested in helping to set up infrastructure or maintain it, this is a way to get involved</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there is some interest so far</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... feel free to learn more on github</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the next announcement is that the nomination period for the W3C technical architecture group</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... some people in this group have self nominated</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s important for us to have our technical concerns and understanding influence the W3C standards devleopment</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... anyone else from this ecosystem who wants to self nominate and step up, it&apos;s very useful to build that connective tissues to the rest of the WGs at the w3c</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and other groups such as ietf etc</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;m not so partial as to who in our community steps up, but I think it&apos;s useful if someone from our community has a voice</div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  I said the piece I needed to on that <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... happy to take questions</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  To speak to what wayne said about the Technical Architecture Group <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for those of you not familiar with waht the w3c TAG does, they effectively set the deign requirements for the entirety of the web</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... what we want the web to become is partly from an architectural perspective the TAGs job</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... people on the TAG are supposed to be there as individuals first</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s not supposed to be representing a compnay, but the people of the Web and what&apos;s best for the Web</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it is very high level architectural position and it has broad ramifications around the work that w3c does</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I wanted to +1 wayne for running and amy for running, I think they would bring what our group does into the thought process around what the future of the web looks like</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... which is a really great thing to do</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the other thing to note is that multiple seats open up, so we could find ourselves in a situation where both wayne and amy are on the TAG and that would be really great for this community</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... all that to say, the people that vote are the w3c members, the AC reps who vote, so be aware that that election is happening</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I believe the timeline is nominations in the next couple of days and a voting period for about a month, and the term starts in February</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Heather Vescent</span>:  Anyone else have any questions or comments on the infrastructure task force? <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... My concern is that, while I appreciate all the efforts, I believe the technical solution creates an obstacle for participation for folks that are not currently participating in this community</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I want to ask that the task force includes not the usual suspects to gather feedback and usage data that it includes people that would like to participate from the fringe, geographic timezones,s different language structures, from different skillsets, that are not just from a technical background</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... but also from design, anthropological, ux, marketing and usability, not just technical folks</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... because I would like to see the importance of having a meeting infra that&apos;s accessible is an improvement in the work we do here</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and to date I still see technical obstacles being raised with our current system</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  I agree <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that there are things that have to do with running the infra that require no ability to write code or even use git and if we&apos;re able to convert more responsibilities toward that that is definitely a win</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for example being able to help with the notes and publishing them and clean them up, that shouldn&apos;t require anyone to enter a commandline if they&apos;re&apos; not used to it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... strive towards creating modes of engagement that don&apos;t require a technical background so the surface are of upholding the community can be spread over more people who are intersted</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you&apos;re interested in contributing, technical or not, comment on github or talk in the mailing list</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Heather Vescent</span>:  I want to alert the community to 2 activities happening in the chair infrastructure <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;re doing some succession planning</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... kim has been one of the most phenomenal chairs, but will be moving on next year</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we want to capture everything and onboard new chairs</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Heather Vescent</span>: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/165">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/165</a> <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there was some documentation but not a lot</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;ve been working on creating a job description and instruciton manual for what chairs do</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is everything the job requires</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... including running minutes, meetings, speakers, the work items, process</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot of these processes have been wrapped up</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;re putting the documentation together</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;re at a point where the chairs are reviewing this but will be sharing it with you</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... having a job description will be very useful when we do have an open call for a new chair</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Heather Vescent</span>: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/164">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/164</a> <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The other thing I want to alert the community to is task for documentation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there&apos;s been a lot of interest in having task forces in the ccg</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... as a sub meeting of the ccg</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;v ehad variosu folks approach us to start task forces</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... all of our task forces to date have evolved out of this meeting</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... seemed like it was appropriate to put together some more formal task force process docs and an faq</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so I&apos;v ebeen working on that</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... to define the taskforce scope, the relationship with the main meetings, responsibilities of minutes etc</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we are looking to formalise that information</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s a draft that the chairs will be reviewing and we&apos;ll share it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you are interested in participatin gor contributing to either the job description, activities that chairs do or task force please get in touch with  me</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;m driving the draft of these</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... any questions?</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Jeff Stephens and Dignari team</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Heather Vescent</span>:  If you joined the wallet meeting a month ago you might have seen some of their work <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... today Jeff and team are going to give an overview of the work they did</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I was really impressed in particular by their work because in my mind it really involves the entire team and ways of thinking about things</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Stephens</span>:  Thank you for the opportunity to join the meeting today <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Dignari was formed in 2013, a woman-owned small business in washington dc</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we provide services like program strategy, data science, analytics, as well as ui/ux and human centered design</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we dabble in a number of areas, a long history in identity management</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we have the technical side as well as the ui/ux side</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... allowed us to join forces</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... here with a couple of my colleagues, I&apos;m jeff stephnes, the chief technology officer</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... alex is going to go through some use cases</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... then we&apos;ll field some questions</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Alex Jackl</span>:  One of the thing swe wanted to do, we decided to give you a presentation in real time <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;ll make available the video that was shared with the community event with svip</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this gives us an opportunity to walk through it together</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and to take some of the feedback we got from that community event and show you ways we&apos;ve updated as a result of that</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we presented this thing at the end of october</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and submitted it in mid october for the DHS digital wallet challenge</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is our branding scheme for the digital wallet</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a colour scheme rendering of your desktop application and mobile application</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the first thing an individual is going to do is to create an account</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you provide basic information, username and passowrd</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this would b where you present your EULA agreement and agree to that</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... once the account is created you have the ability to log in with that username and password and update to use biometric or any identity assurance capability</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there&apos;s also potentially a link down here to that woudl provide disclosures and privacy policies</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... let&apos;s assume jane r user is logging in</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... on the desktop there are 9 identity domains</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the areas where you can group the verifiable credentials that you want to add</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... here&apos;s a rendering of the same information in th emobile app</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in her educational part is a copy of her degree</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in any of these identity domains, the same interface occurs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you click, see any credentials, and there&apos;s a + sign to add additional credentials</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... as we looked at the digital wallet challenge, one of the keys for us was the way you access information is consistent for the user</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... whether it&apos;s your legal identity or education information you&apos;re doing everything the same way</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... even the presentation is similar</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for the DHS digital wallet challenge we were presented with a single use case</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... jane is applying for a job and as aprt of the application the employer has asked for a permanent resident card and her degree</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the first thing that jane has to do is go to the issuers and obtain these verifiable credentials from her educational instutuition and USCIS</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... first thing is to get degree information from her university</div>
<div class="information">&lt;phil&gt; What I don&apos;t see in the categories of credentials are assertions about work such as those emerging from HR Open, e.g., Work History.  Or Salary History. etc. Are the groupings arbitrary, and more can be created?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can see that when she selects adding an education degree to her wallet she can fill out information that lets them look her up</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if she already has a login to the university she can use that</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for further capabilities down the road, if instituations or issues are doing biometric verification that can be incorporated</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for the demo, for jane&apos;s request, we assume she fills out this form and submits the request</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the assumption here is that all of the work that the ccg and w3c has done, the trust mechanisms in place to secure the communication between the holder and issuer and verifier and issuer, are all assumed to be behind the scenes</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it connected with the institution, secured as part of that, did the verification based on the information provided, and once it was deemed fit they provided the credential to her</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... now you can see it&apos;s here to add to the wallet</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and now it&apos;s in the wallet</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the next thing we&apos;re going to do is to provide her permanent resident card</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can see how the mobile and desktop versions work and are consistent</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... now we add another item</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can provide a username and password to login or provide information by a form</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... let&apos;s say she logged in</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the ocnnection is established, they provide all their verification and provide the permanent resident card</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and jane adds it to wallet</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... as part of that use case she was asked to provide both of those</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... from a user experience perspective we really wanted to give the digital wallet interface an ability to create &apos;packages&apos; - that&apos;s your verifiable presentation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... here jane is going to click on packages and create a new one</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and add her permanent resident card</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... then we&apos;ll click on another item and add her education</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... she has multiple pieces of information available, her degree and transcripts</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... sh eobtained all that from the issuer</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;r egoing to assume they only need the degree</div>
<div class="information">&lt;phil&gt; How is the educational credential represented?  Via a CLR? Or are there a set of credential data model standard payloads? Alternately, is this just a image of the diploma?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... when she adds it to th epackage only her degree is added, not her transcripts</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... her package has the permanent resident card and her university credential</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and click create</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one of two things can happen</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... say jane is going to visit the employer for an interview</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... at that point she could save the qr code and retrieve it when she sees the employer for the interview, who can scan it and get the information</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... alternatively, submit remotely</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... from the mobile application you would scan a qr code that&apos;s provided by the employer remotely</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... let&apos;s do that scenario</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... jane is going to submit her digital package to the employer</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... she&apos;s gonna click share, and provide consent to release her permanent resident card and her degree</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... her job application will go from pending to sent</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the last thing to show is the different ways through this ui/ux of managing your verifiable credential or your packages</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you see here there are multiple packages</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... she has a package for a mortgage refinance</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... another for an application for a graduate degree</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... let&apos;s assume she completed the mortgage and no longer needs this package</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... she can delete it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;ll ask to confirm</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and it removes it from the list</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... blurring those two will be troublesome</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... i&apos;ve run into this in different places, it&apos;s getting worse</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s an interesting point - the challenge of these connections to issuers and verifiers, any time we&apos;re connecting with an external entity, from a ui/ux perspective our goal is to make it consistent regardless of how you&apos;re connecting</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... thats&apos; the challenge</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you&apos;re right that certain issues require a username, others require an email</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for us to work with the ccg to figure out how to make that easier, that would be how we as ui/ux designers could provide some help there to bridge that</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... one of the things that jumped out at me was the interaction between the walle tand the issuer</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there are two interaction paradigms in play</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the sovrin/indy interaction paradigm which I think was mocked up</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there&apos;s also the crednetial handler / browser baed interaction paradigm</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... they&apos;re very different</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... had you made a decision to use one path vs the other?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and if you wer enot aware that there was this other interaction paradigm, maybe one of the things we could talk about next time is how that interaction paradigm is different</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for example, the uis that you have have this concept of the individual creating the packages</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... whereas the other has the entity requesting a set of credentials from you</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you don&apos;t need to know what to put together, they ask for as et of things and you decide whether to share</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s very different</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... where are you in that thought process?</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Stephens</span>:  That&apos;s awesome feedback, we want clarity on that, we are not experts, getting these nuanced pieces of tech from the community is valuable <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I didn&apos;t kn othe two interactions but I see what you&apos;re saying</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... driven by the end user or requesitng entity as the two interactions</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we did from the perspective of the individual because it&apos;s a digital wallet</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... where the entity, would they have a similar concept? I&apos;m going to interact with a number of people</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yes and no, use cases where you might <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that&apos;s a sideline thing</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the main thing I was wondering is that there are a set of dhs videos showing testing of all these wallets</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that video is good to look at because it flip sthe paradigm, it shows you the other paradigm</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I get that what you did was individual centric</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the other is organisation centric</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... both legitimate</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if we&apos;re going to do a good job we need to understand both and when you use one over the other</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Alex Jackl</span>:  I didn&apos;t see the other videos, thanks <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;phil&gt; Can someone (Anil) post the link to the wallet videos that Manu referred to?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... from our perspective we went with the concept of providing the optimcal control for the holder</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I think what we&apos;re learning is from a ui/ux we have to provide the capability or guidence to support not only the holder creating the pacakge but the issuer/verifiers having that ability</div>
<div class="information">&lt;heathervescent&gt; This is an opportunity to have clear, explicit use cases.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... from the ui/ux perspective we can create designs to support both</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this could be an opportunity for us in the community to have explicit use cases</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... the fact that you&apos;re demonstration is so thorough in addressing different componants moves us to the point manu made</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I struggled with building wireframes</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... from the subject&apos;s perspective</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a question I have in seeing your demo is I expect that people will not be familiar with this duality that manu has mentioned</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... specificially they wil not understand when qr codes are used other than in an airline boarding situation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... using the qr codes in any other way is going to have to be presumably explained</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is a question.. how we deal with this duality</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... sometimes the qr code is a request and sometimes a presentation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this overlaps with manu&apos;s point</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... then the related point has to do with the form that you showed</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... again, very good that you put it in there becuase it shows the reality of the situation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in that case the user needs to be clear as to whether the information on the form is going directly to the issuer or the verifier</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in the oauth sense you kind of know when you look who you are talking to, what domain you are entering the information to</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... whether you had this problem or understand it as a privacy issue when it comes to introducing these forms into the app</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Jeff Stephens</span>:  It&apos;s true that a lot of these concepts are new and strange to common users <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... seeing the wireframs allows us to ask better questions</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... manu was getting at the question of being ablet o use selective disclosure</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so you can create a presentation containing only the things you want disclosed</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Ted Thibodeau</span>: +1 Selective disclosure <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;nate_otto_(@ottonomy)_badgr/csky&gt; * though make sure to disambiguate selective disclosure of claims from a single credential vs selecting which credentials form a presentation.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so I was sort of expecting to see mechanisms in the UI to take that complex acitivity and make it easy for the individual to pick the stuff they&apos;d like to convey</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I didn&apos;t see that, want to emphasis that seems like an important dimension</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The data modesl we have to choose from, there was no reference to the different sorts of packages that these credentials were bieng conveyed in</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... these things are useful because they have richer ability to convey information about what a person has learned and can do</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... which is a tremendous benefit other than I got a degree or not</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one of the benefits we hope for is to enable the individual to have that expressive ability tod escribe elements of their assertion</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I didn&apos;t see any reference into I got a degree, just an image of a diploma</div>
<div class="information">&lt;tallted&gt; random related concern -- university VC about degree may include year of attainment -- which hints at subject&apos;s *age* which can feed into discrimination issues, so may not be desired as inclusion in disclosure...</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... was curious to know whether that&apos;s in a second phase of consideration or just wans&apos;t the choice of the data model that the different VCs may have, wans&apos;t anywhere referenced int the choice of what i had as a user</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... although you saw the picture of the diploma doesn&apos;t mean the information sent was a picture</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s a delicate balance with what we show to a  user</div>
