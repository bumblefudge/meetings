Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Hi everyone uh welcome to uh this week's w3c ccg 
  meeting uh today we are very excited to have Manu and Dave uh 
  from digital bizarre to lead a discussion on VC ping status list 
  uh I saw that in the past few hours people already have questions 
  so this will be a very exciting conversation.
Harrison_Tang: Uh before we start I just want to uh go over some 
  uh agenda items.
Harrison_Tang: I just want.
Harrison_Tang: Want to make sure that.
Harrison_Tang: To each other.
Harrison_Tang: I think we have been doing that for the last 2 
  years but uh.
Harrison_Tang: Doesn't hurt to have a quick reminder at the 
  beginning of each meeting.
Harrison_Tang: A quick intellectual property you know uh anyone 
  can participate in these calls however all substantive 
  contributions to any ccg work items must be member of the ccg 
  with full IPR agreements signed if you have any questions in 
  regards to that or uh any troubles creating the w3c account uh 
  feel free to just reach out to any of the cultures.
Harrison_Tang:  a quick call note.
Harrison_Tang: Are being automatic.
Harrison_Tang: We try to publish it within the next few days um.
Harrison_Tang:  you know if.
Harrison_Tang: You saw some.
Harrison_Tang: We use GT chat uh to cue the speakers during the 
  call you can type in Q Plus in the comments uh.
Harrison_Tang: In a queue or.
Harrison_Tang: 2 minus to remove.
Harrison_Tang: All right uh I think it's time for the 
  introductions and reintroductions so if you're new to the 
  community or you haven't been active and want to re-engage with 
  the community uh feel free to just uh unmute and introduce 
  yourself.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah just uh some status updates on how the 
  standardization work is going in the verifiable credential 
  working group at the worldwide Web Consortium um.
Harrison_Tang: Let us know.
Manu Sporny:  Uh we are uh we we've now moved the verifiable 
  credentials to 0 specification into the candidate recommendation 
  uh phase that's the phase right before you propose it uh for uh 
  an official vote for it to become a global standard um so uh at 
  this point.
Manu Sporny:  DC data model 2.
Manu Sporny:  Uh ecdsa eddsa are all in the candidate 
  recommendation phase in the next month we are expecting uh VC 
  Jose cozy um uh and uh bit string status list the thing we're 
  talking about today uh to go into candidate recommendation and 
  then shortly thereafter for BBS to go into candidate 
  recommendation um uh once that happens all of the documents that 
  the group has been working on will be in the candidate 
  recommendation phase um people are implementing now there are 
  plenty of um.
Manu Sporny:  A large quite.
Manu Sporny:  Quite a good.
Manu Sporny:  Board I think we have.
Manu Sporny:  Uh companies implementing right now 11 of them are 
  integrated with the test Suites um the test Suites continue to be 
  updated um so if you're an implementer now is a good time to 
  start implementing um and uh as I think folks know we have.
Manu Sporny:  Office hours for implementers um that are held like 
  every other week I don't think Benjamin's here today but Benjamin 
  uh has been heading that up so if you've got any questions 
  concerns with implementing against the verifiable credential 20 
  stuff um they are now office hours that you can show up uh to and 
  ask your questions there um so the good news there is that you 
  know we've got many things moving into the candidate 
  recommendation phase and we have active test Suites and 
  implementers implementing uh the not so great news is we're 
  running out of time for our Charter our Charter ends in June uh 
  there is an expectation that we'll get a charter extension 
  primarily because we've demonstrated that we're making.
Manu Sporny:  That's it for me.
Manu Sporny:   Really good progress uh across the board um.
Geun-Hyung Kim: :Clap:
Harrison_Tang: Thank you man.
Harrison_Tang: By the way if you're curious about what's new on 
  the verified credentials data model version 2 uh we actually 
  invited monu back as well as Brent uh to talk about uh what's new 
  uh next week.
Harrison_Tang: All right any other announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Last call for announcements or reminders.
Kaliya Young:  Um so we've got internet identity Works number 38 
  coming up in April April 16 to.
Kaliya Young:  16 To 18 the digital identity unconference Europe 
  happening in Zurich in the third week of June I believe it's the 
  18th to the 20th and then.
Kaliya Young:  We've got um.
Kaliya Young:  Did unconference Africa happening in Cape Town.
Kaliya Young:  And we're currently deciding on dates for a.
Kaliya Young:  Um our Asian events in Thailand in early 2025 
  between the 2nd and the third week of January so but he has any 
  date conflicts they want to to a wide let us know um I'm 
  proactively reaching out to folks in the region to understand 
  what our key sort of themes and.
Kaliya Young:   Sort of.
Kaliya Young:  Key themes and potential discussion topics will 
  be.
Kaliya Young:  Um so if you have thoughts on that let me know and 
  yeah that's from updates from iaw and.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Clea.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @kaliya lol speaking of date conflicts, any 
  chance not to have fall IIW over halloween? :)
Harrison_Tang: Seems like we have quite a bit of the events 
  coming up.
<manu_sporny> Lots going on in IIW land! :)
Harrison_Tang: Try any other uh last announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Any updates on the work items.
Harrison_Tang: By the way uh so will 1 of our cultures is uh 
  heading uh the initiative to uh.
Harrison_Tang:  uh clean up.
Harrison_Tang: And actually extend.
Harrison_Tang: Map and we will.
<kaliya_identity_woman> @Dmitri - I know it is a conflict - I 
  raised it early on...but it was the only week the Musuem was 
  avaliable.
<dmitri_zagidulin> np <3
<kaliya_identity_woman> fly home Thursday?
<dmitri_zagidulin> yep!
<kaliya_identity_woman> Or we have our own constume party
<dmitri_zagidulin> thaaaats the spirit
Harrison_Tang: More news uh and more announcements to make uh in 
  April sometime in April so we're scheduling sometime in April to 
  kind of present that role mapping if you have any feedback or 
  comments in regards to the ccg road map or in regards to what 
  kind of work items we should be taking on or what we should be 
  working on uh feel free to reach out to any of the cultures but 
  will is actually taking the lead on that.
<kaliya_identity_woman> looking forward to the creative constumes 
  "red line"  or "open issue"
Harrison_Tang: Right last calls for announcements work items 
  introductions.
<manu_sporny> I call "The Ghost of Identity Past"
<dmitri_zagidulin> LOL
<kim_duffy> Teacher's pet~
<manu_sporny> haha
Harrison_Tang: Great let's get to the main agenda so uh again we 
  are very excited to have Manu and Dave here to uh leave a 
  discussion on VC Bering status list uh this is probably the very 
  first time in the last year where the presenter actually share 
  with me the presentation in advance so I want to give a quick 
  shout out to them they're quite prepared uh and uh a quick note 
  uh B string stats list is a way to publish status information 
  like s uh s suspensions or revocations of the VC so.
Harrison_Tang:  I I'll let them kind of.
Harrison_Tang: Explain dive into the first.
Harrison_Tang: Further as well as answering.
Harrison_Tang: That's in the.
Harrison_Tang: Money the stage is yours thank you.
Manu Sporny:  Awesome thanks Harrison uh and thanks for the 
  invite uh to present let me go ahead and share my screen make 
  sure folks can see this.
Manu Sporny:  Um Can folks see that.
<phil_long_(t3)> yes
<harrison_tang> amazing!
Geun-Hyung Kim: :Clap:
Manu Sporny:  Okay um oh and I was able to finally extract the 
  w3c credentials community group banners that we can put it on 
  slide deck so there's a there's a community resource here you can 
  copy and paste this now um if we want to put these on ccg slide 
  decks um it's a very small.
Manu Sporny:   Small thing.
Manu Sporny:  And anyway um.
<dmitri_zagidulin> I want a desk like that guy has, in the 
  slide...
Manu Sporny:  Today we're going to talk a bit about bitstring 
  status list um bitstring status list is uh 1 of the uh status 
  list Technologies uh or really the only status list technology 
  that is being standardized in the verifiable credential working 
  group right now um uh.
Manu Sporny:  Today I think we we'll we'll be covering like.
Manu Sporny:   You know.
Manu Sporny:  Does it do.
Geun-Hyung Kim: +1 Dmitri, desk goals
Manu Sporny:  Uh you know why did we build it what kind of 
  privacy aims did we have when we were building it uh we'll look 
  into a bit uh in in how it uh works like what makes it tick um uh 
  and then we'll have a little bit of discussion like you know a 
  bit string status list is not the end all be all be all status 
  list mechanism for uh VCS it it it it it achieves some good 
  privacy goals but like we can do better and so there's some talk 
  about what the next version.
Manu Sporny:   Might end up looking like um.
Manu Sporny:  But that's what we're going to cover today um feel 
  free.
Manu Sporny:  Jump in any.
Manu Sporny:  Raise your hands keep.
Manu Sporny:  We can do.
Manu Sporny:  As we can.
Manu Sporny:  So I don't think this is.
Manu Sporny:  Um all right uh so let's take a quick look at what 
  this is um.
<bobwyman> Has the transcription stopped?
<phil_long_(t3)> appears it has
<harrison_tang> hm ... it says that the transcriber is still 
  active on my end
<phil_long_(t3)> not seeing it in chat
Manu Sporny:  Uh okay so uh that's what we mean by space 
  efficient we wanted to make sure that the the status um uh list 
  uh even with Millions to tens of millions to billions um stayed 
  uh uh space efficient um.
<phil_long_(t3)> it's baaacck
Manu Sporny:  So verifiable credentials have a credential status 
  field and that lets you publish things um that you might want to 
  update after the holder gets the credential uh meaning like after 
  a holder receives a verifiable credential you might want to do 
  things to that credential like uh revoke it or suspend it or uh a 
  variety of other kind of status flipping um uh things um we 
  wanted um the mechanism the bitstring status list mechanism to be 
  privacy preserving by default um some of the previous ways of 
  doing status lists required the holder of the digital credential 
  or whoever was verified it to do what's called phoning home so 
  they would go out and try and ask the issuer like hey is this 
  credential still valid and that tells the issuer that you know 
  you the holder were using your credential.
Manu Sporny:  And we wanted to make sure that we covered things 
  like suspension and revocation okay so so so some of the design 
  goals here was we wanted to um provide status information for 
  Long Live credentials that was like 1 of the design goals but we 
  wanted to do it in a way that didn't like instantaneously violate 
  an individual's privacy so we want we had some privacy goals that 
  we wanted to design for um uh that would protect protect the 
  individual uh uh primarily from.
Manu Sporny:  Being tracked by the issuer.
Manu Sporny:  We wanted to make it.
Manu Sporny:  Uh in in.
Manu Sporny:  Easy to implement.
Manu Sporny:  The specification is published here at this link at 
  the bottom um.
Manu Sporny:  Standards track Glo.
Manu Sporny:   With the verifier and they get full transparent 
  like they get to see you using the credentials so think about 
  you're using a driver's license to get into a bar you know if you 
  phone home to the issue of the driver's license then the that 
  government agency knows that you're going into bars and when 
  you're going into bars and and things of that nature so that's 
  what we mean by privacy preserving we wanted to stop that from 
  happening uh the other thing was we wanted to wanted it to be 
  space efficient.
Manu Sporny:  Specification um we are almost at the candidate 
  recommendation phase which basically means like we're pretty much 
  done with the design um we we think we're done uh with the design 
  we want people to implement.
Manu Sporny:  Minute we want them to.
Manu Sporny:  Their feedback in.
Manu Sporny:  This thing is being rolled out into production 
  environments um uh.
Manu Sporny:  Very soon now within like the next couple of weeks 
  to months so um.
Manu Sporny:   Um because verifiable credentials um could have 
  like uh thousands of different types sorry you could have 
  millions um of uh credentials issued having a status list uh per 
  um uh having having like a status be big per credential would be 
  like.
Manu Sporny:  So so this thing is you know.
Manu Sporny:  Is on track to.
Manu Sporny:  Via Global stand.
Manu Sporny:   You know a small value like you know 1 byte or 3 
  bytes or 10 bytes multiplied by millions to tens of millions to 
  billions so that wouldn't be um that wouldn't be a good thing um.
Manu Sporny:  Okay that's the high level um let's look a little 
  bit at the privacy considerations the things that we wanted to.
Manu Sporny:  Diagram on the Right comes from the VC data model 
  um.
Manu Sporny:  Specification it kind of shows you the ecosystem 
  like the you know the issuer holder verifier um registry 
  ecosystem and then a number of actions that you can take while 
  you're in the ecosystem and what that action you know who 
  communicates during that action so the the action we're looking 
  at right here is this check status uh might not preserve privacy 
  uh you know repeatable thing highlighted in in red at the center 
  of the diagram here uh this is when a verifier receives a digital 
  credential from a holder and then they go to check the status um 
  from the status list published by the issuer um so a couple of 
  like high level requirements here was that the issuer when when 
  the verifier contacted the issuer and this this is a form of like 
  phoning home right um bad phoning home is when the issuer is when 
  the verifier contacts the issuer and says this is exactly who 
  I'm.
Manu Sporny:   I want to know about.
Manu Sporny:   Um better like.
Manu Sporny:  More privacy Preserve.
Manu Sporny:  Serving is when the verifier.
Manu Sporny:  Contacts the issue.
Manu Sporny:  I need a list.
Manu Sporny:  Of you know uh statuses from you um and the list is 
  fairly large like 100 thousand or whatever so what we wanted was.
Manu Sporny:  To make sure.
Manu Sporny:  To the sub.
Manu Sporny:  The verifier asking.
Manu Sporny:  There has to be some kind of group group privacy uh 
  at play there um the other design goal that we had is like we 
  wanted to eliminate this phone home you know the the the we 
  wanted to eliminate the verifier contacting the issue at all like 
  completely like so the design had to enable that to happen in 
  fact with bitstring status list the holder can provide the 
  verifiable credential and in parallel they can provide the status 
  list the current status list to the verifier so that the verifier 
  never has to contact the issuer now.
Manu Sporny:  Whether or not that's going to play out in 
  practice.
Manu Sporny:  Um is still like to be determined but um in theory 
  if the holder you know contacts the verifier and goes.
Manu Sporny:   Here's my.
Manu Sporny:  You know here's.
Manu Sporny:  Electricians license in here is uh uh proof that 
  this thing has not been revoked as of today the verifier can look 
  at both of those verifiable verifiable credentials and go yep 
  that checks out without having to talk to the issuer at all so 
  the second bullet point here is about making sure that the holder 
  um and the verifier can have an interaction where the verifier 
  doesn't actually need to contact the the issuer at all um that's 
  you know a privacy preserving more privacy preserving um and 
  finally um uh we uh well let's stop there we'll go ahead.
<dave_longley> the key point: the status list itself is expressed 
  in a VC.
Manu Sporny:  There is a valid from and valid until date on the 
  status list credential uh that gives them some idea of like when 
  it was issued so for example like if I hand you you know I I give 
  you my I don't have an electrician's license I give you my 
  electrician's license and I and I give you uh the status list 
  associated with it those are 2 verify credentials and the only 
  thing that you need to get from the issuer is like their did 
  document and their their keys and you can verify that both of 
  those you know are are valid they were they were issued today and 
  if your use case is such that you're like well this is valid of 
  to as of today um or it's valid as of like 3 days ago that's good 
  enough for my use case then you don't need to.
Manu Sporny:   Call back.
Manu Sporny:  To get the status list.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> How does this impact an issuer's 
  ability to see if the credential was used? Thinking in terms of 
  education provider looking to see if an industry credential 
  helped an individual get a job... maybe too specific of a use 
  case for this convo.
<dave_longley> the design here is to enable status checking 
  without the issuer knowing about use of a specific VC
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Adapters but there are some use 
  cases where it might actually be beneficial right from economic 
  impact and um but yeah those are Case by case and.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Would be conversations if 
  somebody's actually implementing VC's in Earnest and they're 
  they're looking at at doing some of that that would be.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Would want to bake that in but I I 
  think yeah totally understand what what the point is here is you 
  don't want to enable that by default so thanks.
Manu Sporny:   Did that make sense.
Manu Sporny:   Yes exactly right yep yep.
<dave_longley> decoupling usage from status checking enables 
  privacy preserving checks -- other use cases could involve some 
  other layer for usage tracking where it makes sense (and with 
  holder consent, etc.)
<bobwyman> Please provide one example of when the issuer has a 
  reasonable interest in knowing when the credential is used.
Manu Sporny:  Is important to measure how these things.
Manu Sporny:   R Virginia.
Manu Sporny:  Are being used in the wild but but there there may 
  be better ways of.
Manu Sporny:  All that kind.
Manu Sporny:   Doing that rather than.
Manu Sporny:  You got to be.
Manu Sporny:  When you do those kinds of things these days um.
Manu Sporny:   Through the technology through the core technology 
  um a better ways meaning like you need to get consent from your 
  community you need to be very clear that you know you are 
  aggregating you know usage if you are going if an issuer is going 
  to collude with a verifier they need to be very transparent about 
  that because if they're not it will come back in a very negative 
  way uh on them um primarily through like uh privacy regulation 
  California consumer Privacy Act G.
Manu Sporny:  So those are the those are kind of the the protect 
  against tracking by the issuer concerns that we had um we also 
  wanted to protect against statistical analysis um I I also want 
  people to pay pay close attention.
Manu Sporny:  We are really we tried.
Manu Sporny:  Really hard to protect.
Manu Sporny:  Gains tracking by.
Manu Sporny:  Uh in a short.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> @bobwyman thinking about specific 
  industry credentials being issued by education providers that 
  lead to job placement.
Manu Sporny:  Uh issuer based.
Manu Sporny:  When 2 verify.
Manu Sporny:  Together and try to collude.
Manu Sporny:  To track you is a much.
Manu Sporny:  Problem it is.
Manu Sporny:  It's such a difficult 1 to to address we can talk 
  about it a bit later but uh I wanted to be transparent about you 
  know the things that we felt we could address and the things that 
  we felt like we couldn't uh easily address um.
Manu Sporny:  Okay protecting against statistical analysis so um 
  we wanted to make sure that you know if we were providing 
  something for uh heard uh sorry group privacy we're using the 
  word group privacy now instead of her privacy um we wanted to 
  make sure that that group privacy actually meant something 
  meaning that if someone were to watch the status list as it 
  changed throughout time would they be able to glean any kind of 
  information from it would they be able to uh understand like who 
  a subset of the population was or where you were in that subset 
  of the population or how that how that group interact you know 
  works in the in the real world so um the way you do that is you 
  you watch the list and then you run statistical analysis uh on it 
  um so for example if you had a list uh let's say you had a list a 
  status list that's a hundred thousand items uh a large we we 
  have.
Manu Sporny:   Minimum sizes and 100 thousand.
Manu Sporny:  And you don't go smaller than 100 thousand um the 
  spec.
Manu Sporny:  So that you do not.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> @bobwyman ... the value prop for 
  learning providers offering training programs to individuals 
  looking to upskill and earn more
Manu Sporny:  Um so so if you started uh allocating indexes.
Manu Sporny:  Where the first VC gets the first index you know 
  gets the first uh bit the second VC gets the second bit the third 
  VC gets the third bit and so on and so forth and you were to just 
  like bulk um revoke a set of credentials or you were to kind of 
  like revoke a certain credentials um in the set someone looking 
  at that looking at the giant list the giant array of of bits 
  would notice that like bits of above 25,000 are just quiet 
  they're always zero right they they never change and that would 
  allow statistically you would basically say oh this group is less 
  than 25,000 individuals right um uh and you could watch for 
  patterns in that where like oh the front of the list has a lot 
  more revoke revocations than the back of the list and over time 
  it looks like these credentials are being revoked you know 6 
  months after they're they're being issued and if you know the 
  type of.
Manu Sporny:   Credential then you can start kind of profiling 
  you know the group.
Manu Sporny:  So we wanted to make sure that.
Manu Sporny:  Status changes leak is little information as 
  possible which means that effectively what that means is like do 
  your index allocation randomly use a use a cryptographically you 
  know uh uh cryptographic random number generator and every time 
  you issue a credential you pick a totally random Place uh in 
  there that you um issue a credential out of there are other 
  tactics like uh use um use uh decoy values in here where some of 
  them are not real randomly flip uh decoy bits when you flip real 
  bits there's all kinds of uh Innovation that can happen here that 
  that helps preserve privacy uh the spec currently just says do it 
  randomly it doesn't say do all those other things because we 
  didn't feel comfortable.
Manu Sporny:  Kind of an an emerging uh field um how you how you 
  do privacy protection correctly um in in something like this but 
  doing random index allocation is is pretty good to start with um 
  uh that's that's kind of the the the bare minimum and um.
Manu Sporny:   And then.
Manu Sporny:  Else that you do on.
Manu Sporny:  Top of it.
Manu Sporny:  All right uh I there were a couple of other goals 
  here um you know we we wanted to make sure that it was also 
  fairly easy and straightforward to implement there are all kinds 
  of like super uh Advanced zero knowledge proof uh mechanisms to 
  do zkp based like uh credential status and and things like that 
  the the problem with many of those um uh Solutions is that they 
  they haven't had a tremendous amount of analysis done on them uh 
  by um frankly by like the National Institute of Standards or the 
  European um Etsy uh which is the The Nest equivalent in the 
  European Union um when these things are deployed and they're 
  deployed at scale and they're deployed for doing things like 
  foundational uh identity uh driver's licenses citizenship cards 
  employment authorization documents things like that um it is very 
  diff it is nearly impossible to convince um.
Manu Sporny:   Nest to use.
Manu Sporny:  Something as a.
Manu Sporny:  Thing that you depend on that hasn't been vetted by 
  them before and so we needed to 1 of the 1 of the constraints we 
  had is we needed to design something where we didn't have to 
  prove that the cryptography or the math was new or novel or 
  anything like that right we we had to use boring old stuff that 
  had been around since like the 60s and 70s um to to make sure 
  that we would we would be able to use this in um.
Manu Sporny:  Cutting Edge use cases as well as.
Manu Sporny:   State government.
Manu Sporny:  Throughout the the world so that was kind of 
  another design goal here is 1 make the Implement make 
  implementations fairly easy and straightforward um and then also 
  don't use.
Manu Sporny:   Super fancy.
Manu Sporny:  That would never be.
Manu Sporny:  State or a or a state government because those are 
  the entities that are issuing some of these high value digital 
  credentials.
Manu Sporny:  Should have put a.
Manu Sporny:  Slide on that.
Manu Sporny:  But I did not.
Manu Sporny:  Okay um how it works um any any questions on on 
  kind of the the goals here before I move on like you know these 
  are the these are kind of like the Privacy goals implementation 
  goals we had uh anyone can anyone think of something that I 
  didn't mention here or.
Manu Sporny:  Other things you're wondering about whether or not 
  we thought about.
Manu Sporny:  All right if not I'll keep going.
Manu Sporny:  How it works okay.
Manu Sporny:  So this is how it works from an issuance 
  perspective and it it's it's super it's it's super simple it's 
  like really really straightforward right um fundamentally you've 
  got to verifiable credential on the left and this is like a a a 
  degree like an example degree credential it's a Bachelor of 
  Science in arts um and it's issued and when it's issued there is 
  this uh credential status.
Manu Sporny:  That's added to it so it's this green this thing in 
  green that is the information that goes in the VC that tells you 
  which 1 of these bits and this bit string status list um this 
  credential is associated with so when a verifier gets this 
  information they they see like oh it's got a credential status in 
  oh it's a revocation list so um in the position in the list is 
  94567 right and here's the here's the link here's the URL uh to 
  the list uh down at the bottom status credential and so the 
  verifier has all the information that they need to pull that 
  information to get the status list and understand which bit is 
  associated with this credential and the purpose of that bit um 
  and that's it that's that's the only extra information that's 
  added to a a verifiable credential um uh to say what its 
  Association you know where where it's revocation list is.
Manu Sporny:   So that's on the left on.
Manu Sporny:  The right here this.
Manu Sporny:  Boxes here that's the.
Manu Sporny:  Status list is.
Manu Sporny:  List of bits uh the lowest bit you know uh is is on 
  the left and the highest bit is on the right and this says 16 
  kilobytes which is about 131000 entries um you know you can just 
  wave your hands and say it's like it's over 100,000 entries right 
  um now uh this thing uncompressed is 16 kilobytes in size which 
  is Tiny by the I mean that's like.
Manu Sporny:   Super tiny.
Manu Sporny:  Like all of us.
Manu Sporny:  You know watch video online that is like a 
  millisecond of whatever show or movie you're watching right so 
  these These are super tiny um uh in size and we can compress them 
  uh using what's called zlib compression this is a type of 
  compression that's been around.
Manu Sporny:  I don't know is late 70s early 80s it's been around 
  for a really long time um.
Manu Sporny:  That uh basically takes bits that are the same like 
  see all these green values and it compresses them down into like 
  a super small value so if you have a run of like uh let's say you 
  have a run of like a thousand bits and they're all zero.
Manu Sporny:  What the compression will do is say it would use 
  like it's very tiny number like just a just a bite or 2 to say 
  the next thousand bits are all zero right in in that effectively 
  will compress this down you know if you only have a handful of 
  credentials that are revoked um that'll compress the list way 
  down from 16 kilobytes to 16,000 uh bites down to like 135 bites.
Manu Sporny:   So these things.
Manu Sporny:  Things are super.
Manu Sporny:  Uh if we you know if most of the credentials 
  haven't been revoked or if like most of the credentials have been 
  revoked their very space efficient where they're not space 
  efficient is when you have like a total mixture of revoked and 
  unrevoked things that don't have you know long runs of zeros or 
  ones in the list and at that point you know the compression 
  algorithms like I can't help you like it's you know you you end 
  up in that case random noise is the worst thing to compress uh 
  you end up with like around uh 16 kilobytes in size uh sometimes 
  a bit more if it's true truly random noise um.
Manu Sporny:  But all that.
Manu Sporny:  If our goal here is like group privacy of 100,000 
  individuals we can get that in the worst case with 16 kilobytes.
Manu Sporny:   Or in the.
Manu Sporny:  Super tiny um very space-efficient uh and if we do 
  you know random uh you know allocation um uh that's even better 
  so we meet you know our we meet our size um uh requirements in 
  our privacy requirements um uh using this mechanism.
Manu Sporny:  So that's that's it like that that's that's how 
  issuance works the issuer is like I'm going to put a credential 
  status on this thing for revocation I'm going to use this bit to 
  specify the revocation index for this verifiable credential and 
  then and then that's it and it and it creates that um the veriff 
  the issuer will sign the thing on the left it'll do a digital 
  signature on the thing on the left and it'll do a digital 
  signature on the thing on the right which looks just like a a 
  verifiable credential okay so that's issuance let me pause there 
  for a half second see if there are any questions on on issuance.
Manu Sporny:  Okay no questions uh hopefully that means it's 
  pretty clear um.
Manu Sporny:  Next thing is verification how does verification 
  work uh right so so this this verifiable credential is given to 
  the holder this is an individual that puts it in like their 
  digital wallet they go and they want to use it somewhere so let's 
  say you know they want to they're they're getting a job and they 
  want to prove that they have a bachelor's degree um from a 
  particular uh University um and that bachelor's degree has a 
  credential status field because maybe you know the university 
  wants to be able to revoke the credential in the very slim chance 
  that they.
Manu Sporny:  For its found later that the.
Manu Sporny:  Okay so verification the holder's got their degree 
  they go to let's say a job site and um uh they hand the 
  verifiable credential that says that they have graduated from a 
  certain University over to the the HR department um the HR 
  department would then look at the credential see that it is a 
  credential status so it would first check the signature on the 
  credential like is this a valid credential that was issued by 
  this University or not.
Manu Sporny:  Should come back.
Manu Sporny:  As verified yes this is a valid credential the 
  digital signature checks out it hasn't been tampered with then 
  the verifier would start validating in in would look at like oh 
  there's a revocation list here I should probably check the 
  revocation list to make sure that the university hasn't revoked 
  the credentials since they first issued it um and then the 
  verifier basically looks at this field here on the left this 
  credential status field and they go like okay I need to get this 
  from somewhere the status list credential is at this URL so 
  status 3 this URL here and then once I get that status list I'm 
  going to expand the bit string and I'm looking for location 94567 
  in that list um.
Manu Sporny:  Demetri here on the cube.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh thanks uh so thank you first of all uh for 
  the presentation I'm a big fan of the verification list in 
  general uh we're implementing it uh over a DCC uh for our issuer.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Ah and verifiers my question is on the cache 
  control right have we as a community given it some thought can 
  we.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Can we allow the issuer to give some hint 
  possibly inside the status credential itself.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The intended cash uh right so I'm the issuer 
  I'm saying you know what I'm not going to revoke more frequently 
  than once a day so verifiers you can cache this for a day.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh is so yes HTTP has cache control headers 
  but for those of us hosting it uh either statically on a website 
  or on something like GitHub Pages by the way don't host it on 
  GitHub Pages because GitHub has rate limited so learn from our 
  mistakes.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But for those of us who don't have direct 
  control over the HTTP response headers.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Had a cache control field to the status 
  credential itself.
<nate_otto> validUntil
Manu Sporny:  Excellent question Demetri yeah this is certainly 
  come up a bit I see Bob and Dave are on the Queue um so let's 
  let's I think Dave's got some uh uh deep thoughts on on this um 
  but yeah it's it's a it's a it's an excellent excellent question 
  uh Dmitri uh go ahead Bob and and then Dave.
Bob Wyman:  Yeah I'm sorry if this is a silly question not well 
  thought out but if the if the recommended list size is like on 
  the order of a 100K or so um does that mean that.
Bob Wyman:  It would make sense for a low volume issuer to go to 
  a third-party uh uh uh list maintainer so that.
Bob Wyman:  That low volume the the low volume of bits would get 
  buried in a in a in a higher volume of of other bits.
Manu Sporny:  You could do that um so yeah uh yeah so just a just 
  to respond really quickly you could do that it's a little more 
  complicated they would have to be some kind of agreement between 
  those 2 organizations in my expectation is that low volume issuer 
  um would just publish the list themselves because it's you know 
  let's say they're only issuing like 50 credentials or 100s um.
Manu Sporny:  It doesn't really matter if the list is 100,000 
  long it'll compress down to like 200 bytes right and so it's not 
  a huge.
Bob Wyman:  For the for the privacy concerns.
Manu Sporny:  Even for the privacy concerns it's kind of like you 
  know it it doesn't impact them they're they're issuing 50 
  credentials um.
Manu Sporny:  To deploy this thing that was probably not going to 
  be a good good approach you can do it it's always optional you 
  can always layer it on but um I'm suggesting that the um.
Manu Sporny:   But their list is 100,000 long and so anyone 
  looking at the list wouldn't be able to know that they're that's 
  all they're ever going to issue.
Manu Sporny:  The organizational coordination that needs to 
  happen um might not be.
Manu Sporny:   Does that make sense.
Manu Sporny:  But that also doesn't mean that you know bit string 
  as a service.
Manu Sporny:  You know can't can't also happen there's nothing 
  preventing that from happening um.
Manu Sporny:  So you can you can do it either way I'm saying and 
  and I think that you know status list as a service is still a bit 
  of a.
Manu Sporny:   Yeah it's not a requirement it can be done but 
  it's not you know we wanted something that's easy to deploy and 
  so if you have to like depend on some other external entity.
Manu Sporny:  You know we we'll see if.
Manu Sporny:  Did that help Bob.
Bob Wyman:  Yeah I think I need to think about this more.
Dave Longley:  Yeah I was um so uh VCS come with a validity 
  period uh built into them um.
Manu Sporny:  Okay um and then Dave I think you were on the Queue 
  to respond to Demetri's question.
<dmitri_zagidulin> maybe we just rename ttl to cacheControl?
Dave Longley:  Using the valid until invalid from fields and what 
  we've found uh we're current there's currently a field uh called 
  time to live TTL that is in the specification uh we're not sure 
  if if people will Implement using it and that was sort of an 
  attempt to put caching into the credential itself but we found 
  that that might create some conflict um and some false 
  expectations with an issuer so we were a little we were a little 
  worried that um if you know I'm specific this is specifically for 
  cases where you don't have control of ratio be cache headers as 
  you said to metrie we're a little bit worried with using time to 
  live um in credentials because a an issuer might decide to Mark a 
  credential as having a very long validity period but put a short 
  time to live in it um and that might create a false expectation 
  that that some verifier will make sure to actually check the time 
  to live and not the validity period only on the credential on top 
  of that because these.
Dave Longley:   These credentials.
<dmitri_zagidulin> (to imply http semantics)
Dave Longley:  By the holder and.
Dave Longley:  There's no information that's signed about when 
  the holder fetched it so the holder could always say no I got it 
  within the time to live don't worry about that um and so.
Bob Wyman:  Okay so you're saying bit string as a service is not.
Bob Wyman:   Is not a big requirement okay I need to think about 
  that.
Dave Longley:  We think putting those those that sort of caching 
  information is probably not leads to a number of problems and we 
  actually don't think that we actually think that the use case 
  that you're talking about where you want to have for an issuer 
  put these credentials out and have a validity period of about a 
  day can already be solved by just using valid from and valid 
  until in fact what they can do is uh publish these credentials on 
  demand or as status changes with a validity period of about 24 
  hours um and then let people just do their own caching on that 
  basis even if they don't have access to changing HTTP cache 
  headers by having that medium length validity period and poh and 
  doing publishing on demand I think you can accomplish the use 
  case that you're talking about.
Manu Sporny:  Go go ahead to Demetri.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh I understood thank you uh so so 3 thoughts 
  well 1 is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I I can totally see the potential confusion 
  where the validity period is a month but the time to live is a 
  day.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   And the verify.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Buyer also doesn't.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Know when that time to live started from 
  you're right.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Renaming the field to Cache control might be 
  slightly easier but again verifier doesn't know when uh when that 
  period started.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Gives issuer more information that may that we 
  may want to uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To provide but makes sense thank you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh it makes sense that we can use 
  shorter-lived credentials so that that from valid until becomes 
  the cache control that makes sense I I would caution against the 
  uh issuing them on demand because that just kicks the phone home 
  problem over 1 level right uh the the on demand part.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah and it's excellent question to me I mean I I 
  it sounds to me like you know currently we're basically saying 
  just depend on the valid from valid until for the um the status 
  list credential like that is your you know that that is a cache 
  control that you can depend on um and then if you can if you do 
  have control over the HTTP headers set the headers to the same 
  time frame uh so that if people are using HTTP caching uh headers 
  you know it's a line with the the values in the in the status 
  list um the other thing also to keep in mind is is remember we 
  wanted.
<bobwyman> In some cases, an ability to detect that an issuer is 
  active would, in itself, provide valuable information. In such 
  cases, the issuer might want to obscure its activity within a 
  larger set of statuses.
Manu Sporny:  To enable the holder to be able to deliver the 
  status list credential themselves and so if you have like a 
  month-long validity period for the status list if a verifier gets 
  that like and it's a month-long status list they're going to 
  almost certainly go out to the verifier and try to get the latest 
  1 because they're going to they're going to look at it and 
  they're going to go A month's too long I can't be sure you know 
  um I want information as of today they go and they fetch the 
  thing and it turns out it's the same it's the same list right um 
  uh so so maybe you know the right solution here is to have daily 
  or weekly status list credential um uh signatures and your 
  validity dates you know have stick to that range and.
Manu Sporny:   That that that address.
Manu Sporny:  Dresses I believe all of the use cases we've.
Manu Sporny:  Uh found um.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @bobwyman - we were thinking of that approach 
  as well, at DCC, to offer bitstring hosting for a pool of issuers
Manu Sporny:   Go ahead.
Manu Sporny:  I think you were on the Queue there for a little 
  bit.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks uh so I guess my other question and I 
  think a lot of us on the call uh might be interested in that is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So what's next in terms of uh other 
  revocations backs uh what are the design challenges that we're 
  exploring uh what has there been demand for Etc.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah excellent question so I've got a a slide at 
  the end um where I'll get to that so let let me get through the 
  verification I think that's the very next slide or 2 2 down um 
  okay so just to cover what verification you know the verifier 
  gets the credential they look they they get the status list they 
  check the bit if it's you know if it's a revocation status list 
  if the bits 1 it's revoked.
Manu Sporny:  Zero it's not.
Manu Sporny:  Okay so this is kind of leading up to to um 
  Demetri's question.
<dmitri_zagidulin> clear
Manu Sporny:  Uh did we actually address our requirements um so 
  you know because of the design and the way it works the issuer 
  doesn't get to see which individual status is being checked uh 
  individual privacy is preserved as long as the issuer is not a 
  bad actor um uh I'll get into what being a bad actor means later 
  uh the The Observers list so if there's somebody watching the 
  status list change over time um we use uh Randomness and dummy 
  values um uh and so because we do that you know group privacy 
  continues to be preserved again as long as the issuer isn't a bad 
  actor and is trying to like signal things to the outside world by 
  bunching a bunch of issues you know to a certain part of the list 
  um.
Manu Sporny:   From a storage perspective so.
Manu Sporny:  Efficiencies that she achieved because you can't 
  get you know.
Manu Sporny:  Much smaller than a single bit.
Manu Sporny:  Um of story.
Manu Sporny:  This um status list um and then the 1 of the most 
  important things is this ability to deliver the status list for 
  the holder to be able to deliver the status list instead of the 
  verifier needing to go and get it directly from the issuer now 
  this asterisk here is you know we say as long as the issue is not 
  a bad actor because if the issuer is a bad actor they can do 
  something they can do things to violate the individual's privacy 
  for example using 1 status list for every single VC that they 
  issue then when the um verifier comes to check the list there's a 
  1-to-1 mapping between the list and the the issued credential so 
  if the issuer is a bad actor you you really can't do much you 
  know they they have to they have to be bought into the Privacy 
  preserving characteristics and and employ them now you can 
  observe issuers cheating in this way as long as you you know get 
  a a decent number of holders together you get like for example 
  you get a.
Manu Sporny:   You get a thousand hold.
Manu Sporny:  Together and those.
Manu Sporny:  Holders are like we all have.
Manu Sporny:  IDs for our.
Manu Sporny:  That is a signal that the issuer is tracking us 
  right in digital wallets can do this kind of analysis um.
Manu Sporny:  With consent of the individual of course uh to try 
  and protect the individual to basically warn the individual like 
  hey you're electrician's license has a has a tracking cookie in 
  it um you may not want to use this or every time you use this you 
  know the issuer is going to know you're using this.
Manu Sporny:   So those kinds of things can you know um be done 
  to to catch a Bad actors uh go ahead Harrison.
Manu Sporny:  Either is possible.
Manu Sporny:  Either is possible.
Manu Sporny:  What we don't know yet is.
Manu Sporny:  If the digital wallets are going to build in the 
  support for.
Manu Sporny:  Delivering the status lists themselves um and 
  counting on that happening was something that we couldn't do 
  because we couldn't get a straight answer from the wallet 
  providers because the wallet providers were like well yeah sure 
  like if other wallets do it maybe we'll do it too and it's like 
  okay well we can't really build a global standard on on you know.
Manu Sporny:  People waiting around to see what would happen so 
  so we wanted to build it in a way where it was guaranteed you'd 
  be able to get the list but there's a step up from a privacy 
  perspective that wallets could do um if we could convince the the 
  wallet vendors to to do that kind of delivery and the verifiers 
  also have to support it like it's a more complex protocol where 
  the verifier accepts the status list not from the original issue 
  or themselves um but yeah both both approaches are are possible 
  go ahead Demetri.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah I wanted to add that it seems that 
  getting the status list from remote is preferable because.
<dmitri_zagidulin> we're doing that already
Manu Sporny:  You know a large actor that does do exactly what 
  you said which is you know use 2 totally different did keys to 
  sign 2 totally different things and then you have to have a trust 
  list and so on and so forth so um we're putting options uh on the 
  on the T oh Demetri saying they they do that already right so so 
  I mean so so what we're doing is we're putting options on the 
  table um that we don't think are dangerous um from a privacy 
  perspective and then we're going to see.
Manu Sporny:  What we can nudge the ecosystem uh towards uh but 
  this last slide gets into Demitri's you know question which is.
<dmitri_zagidulin> I think this may be partly addressed with a 
  more extensive Known Issuer list
Manu Sporny:  Could we do better and the answer the short answer 
  is yes of course we can do better right there there are these 
  these these others are knowledge proof based schemes that allow 
  you to do uh unlink um revocation um based on ckps uh a non-red 
  V2 has done some really good work in this area they're looking at 
  something called Allosaurus mechanism um in the the key Point 
  here is that the the verifiable credential to data model is 
  designed to be extensible right we are starting off with this 
  because we think it it it does some good things from a privacy 
  perspective um but we know that this is not the end solution like 
  we are going to want to move to these other things um as long as 
  they are proven to be secure as long as you know nation states 
  and state governments are willing to use them like there are a 
  number of things that have to happen in the space for us to move 
  to a different.
Manu Sporny:  But the good news here is that like we have the 
  architecture to to move to the next thing without it being super 
  disruptive on on what we deploy today um.
Manu Sporny:   So that.
Manu Sporny:  That's kind of it and I note that we're we're very 
  much uh at at the end of our time here um so back over to you uh 
  Harrison.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you man thanks a lot any last questions for 
  money.
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks, Manu!
Harrison_Tang: Great thanks for a great presentation and a great 
  discussion uh I think this concludes uh this week's ctg meeting 
  thanks a lot.
