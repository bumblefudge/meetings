  group to update the VC Spec. [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Kaliya Young: I was just going to say that this week there is a 
  conference on that folks might be interested in RightsCon.org
Orie Steele: ... The spec, became a global standard a while ago, 
  this group is responsible for maintence... fixing bugs, updating 
  prose, publishing pre-standards... we can signal to the world 
  what other things we want to do...
Kaliya Young:  Sorry about that, i wasn't eyeing the queue as 
  closely as i would've liked [scribe assist by Wayne Chang]

Orie Steele: See link.
Orie Steele: ... The group needs to comment on the document.... 
  it feels complete, last call for objections
Wayne Chang: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/134
Wayne Chang:  Thanks for the update, next another work item 
  update... [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Markus Sabadello:  Did resolution one of the oldest work items, 
  originally we were developing a seperate spec for did resolution 
  to be paired with did core data model and syntax... [scribe 
  assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... We wanted a spec that defined resolution... 
  resolution and dereferencing... scope has changed a bit since the 
  last DID WG F2F.... DID Core now covers parts of resolution.
Orie Steele: ... Did wg has added some parts of resolution to did 
  core... there is a section that defines inputs and outputs....
Orie Steele: ... We are also discussing representation of meta 
  data... the scope has shifted a bit...
Orie Steele: ... Did resolution spec work has slowed, but we have 
  updated to sync with developments in did wg
Orie Steele: ... For example how metadata is represented.
Orie Steele: ... Now we distinguish between resolution meta data, 
  and did document meta data...
Orie Steele: ... Matrix params have been removed, did params use 
  query strings...
Orie Steele: ... Did resolution spec will still be useful, but 
  some of it is now present in did core.
Orie Steele: ... Did resolution also covers resolver 
  architectures, hosted service vs local.... how is fragment 
  handled... can a resolver act a proxy for other resolvers.... how 
  is that reflected in meta data
Orie Steele: ... Trust in the resolver, architecture questsions, 
  how are did parameters being processed, etc.... did resolution 
  spec will continue to address these concerns
Orie Steele: ... Did core wg only covers the abstract interface.
Orie Steele: ... We have regular calls, switched to bi-weekly
Orie Steele: .... Link to the meeting page will be in IRC, happy 
  to answer questions

Topic: GLEIF

Wayne Chang: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Jul/att-0100/2020-07-28_Accelerating-Digital-Identity-with-the_LEI-W3C-CCG_v1.0_draft.pdf
Wayne Chang:  Speakers are carla and chistof, GLEIF standards for 
  global legal identifier foundaton... eager to hear their use 
  case, [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Carla Casilli:  Thanks for the opportunity, we are relatively 
  new. we manage the LEI, and we are looking at how this is related 
  to VC issuance and verifiacation. [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Will be providing some background, why LEI was 
  created, what it addresses, then cover the opportunity
Orie Steele: ... Christoff will cover the mechanics
Orie Steele: ... Then we will look at specific use cases.
Orie Steele: ... What is an LEI?
Orie Steele: ... Originated in the last financial crisis 2008... 
  global regulaters sought an indentifier for legal entities as we 
  saw finance firms failing
Orie Steele: ... The industry has some standards, but identifying 
  who was legally responsible... everyone had different systems... 
  made regulators job hard, for example when lehman went down...
Orie Steele: ... Also they missed the dependecy lehman had on 
  AIG... and the gauruntees / exposure for lehman.
Orie Steele: ... The industry was asked to engauge with 
  regulators, and LEI was born as an ISO standards
Carla Casilli:  You will see on slide 4, ISO17442 [scribe assist 
  by Orie Steele]
Carla Casilli:  The code is stood up by reference data, legal 
  form, address... as well as relationships [scribe assist by Orie 
  Steele]
Orie Steele: ... All capped in the global system, which GLEIF 
  manages
Orie Steele: Gleif.org
Orie Steele: ... Free access for all users
Carla Casilli:  An LEI is assigned once, it stays with it for 
  life [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Historical data persists... historical data is 
  retained.
Orie Steele: ... Uniquely tied to financial services... but its 
  also used to identify firms, trusts, foundations, or individuals 
  activing in a business capacity
Orie Steele: ... We looked at how LEI can be useful in a digital 
  world for proving identity and digital transactions
Orie Steele: ... We looked at embeding the LEI to identify a 
  person at an org in a role, in standard X509
Orie Steele: ... Intially sovrin, evernym helped look at how LEI 
  could be leveraged in VCs
Orie Steele: ... We took the same use case, for regulatory filing 
  with a legal entity
Orie Steele: ... Like a financial report... tested with PoCs on 
  ethereum and hyperledger indy
Orie Steele: ... People act on behalf of an organization... 
  although these credentials are designed with schemas... we 
  designed these for public discoversability of employee 
  credentials
Orie Steele: ... For example, who is the CEO of org...
Orie Steele: ... We are doing more standards work with ISO to 
  cover langauges and roles ...
Orie Steele: ... GLEF stephan wolf, CEO of GLEIF, for example
Orie Steele: ... We put this credential in a wallet, and anchor 
  it to a blockchain
Orie Steele: ... We have the credentials in organization wallets, 
  person can engage in regulatory filings.
Orie Steele: ... We could expand these assignments for VCs in day 
  to day business as well.
Orie Steele: ... Slide 11, digitial identity chain of trust... we 
  take an identifer from a trusted network like sovrin, we take 
  that number, evaluate an certify LEIs, and VCs containing LEIs
Orie Steele: ... Also interested in extending to 3rd parties
Orie Steele: ... The digitial LEI will then issue another ... 
  (sorry)
Orie Steele: ... The org, person, the role... is the focus of the 
  credential
Orie Steele: ... We have an issuance chain, but also a 
  verification chain of trust all the way back to GLEIF
Orie Steele: Christoff: can everyon here me?
Orie Steele: ... Staring on slide 12... lets look at person 
  representing entity can benefit form VCs
Orie Steele: ... GLEF manages root of chain of trust, the LEI 
  issuers... next to that Digital LEI issuer, which fills out the 
  issuance to legal entities
Orie Steele: ... There are 2 roles, but they can be held by the 
  same organization
Orie Steele: ... 2 Roles can be combined but don't have to
Orie Steele: ... LEI user consumes LEIs and VC content
Orie Steele: ... Moving to slide 14
Orie Steele: ... Our PoC on sovrin... gleif receives s vc which 
  enables issuance, a digital lei issurer credential.
Orie Steele: ... Gives them certifiaction that they are part of 
  the system...
Orie Steele: ... The LEI issuer to an entity... paving the way 
  for a VC...
Orie Steele: ... Legal entity that has an LEI, cna request from 
  the digital lei issue a VC
Moses Ma: Carla and Christof, this is great work, do you have 
  contact information you can share? I'd like to ask a few specific 
  questions offline?
Orie Steele: ... Slide 18.... part fo this request is the digital 
  lei issuer requesting information for GLEIF system
Orie Steele: ... Verification and validation, 3rd party checks, 
  all important
Orie Steele: ... Moving on slide 19... Digital LEI issuer, can 
  issue to the legal entity... equiped with this, the legal entity 
  can now issue credentials to employees
Orie Steele: ... For internal or external use
Orie Steele: ... What are the benefits?
Orie Steele: ... If a person acting in a role of an entity, as a 
  credential which is linked to the entity, lots of powerful stuff 
  can be simplified.
Orie Steele: ... Purchasing related to businesses can be 
  supported by these VCs, onboarding, KYC....
Orie Steele: ... When you do business, you need to know and trust 
  your counter party
Orie Steele: ... Slie 21... specific public roles, like director 
  or officer of legal entity
Orie Steele: ... Usually these persons are already publically 
  discoveralbe
Orie Steele: .... A legal entity can report back the public 
  discoverable roles
Orie Steele: ... Digital lei issuer, can put this into global 
  public central registries
Orie Steele: ... Public information does not contain PII, or 
  company...
Orie Steele: ... You would see there is a CEO, not the name
Orie Steele: ... Data subjects must agree to disclosure
Orie Steele: ... Slide 24, global register
Orie Steele: ... Slide 25 covers use cases, business transactions 
  and regulatory reporting.
Orie Steele: ... In our PoC we covered real companies and 
  regulators
Orie Steele: ... Slide 26: on the GLEIF website, the complete LEI 
  data pool, we can add reported publically discoverable roles
Orie Steele: ... For example, CEO and financial analyst
Orie Steele: ... Allows a user to request more into, which allows 
  for additional discolsure... whihc leads back to the chain of 
  trust.
Orie Steele: ... We can heck the user, entity, issuer chain is 
  verified
Orie Steele: ... Slide 27 covers technical architecture, it was 
  easy... we created fully functional PoC.
Orie Steele: ... See issuance, request for verification, 
  leveraged exisitng building blocks, sovrin, hyperledger indy, we 
  leveraged VON network and BC GOV hyperledger indy based system 
  for state certificated
Orie Steele: ... We had help from everynm to put the bits 
  together
Orie Steele: ... Small integration layer, and application layer.
Orie Steele: ... We don't focus much on mobile apps, we focused 
  on desktop applications for the corportate use case.
Carla Casilli:  Thanks christoff.... so for use cases.. [scribe 
  assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... We summarized the ones we are seeingg, and 
  future PoCs
Orie Steele: ... 1. Focused on filers / reporter to regulators... 
  feedback from regulators was the use case could be expanded to 
  3rd party filers
Orie Steele: ... And auditors.. the flow would be extended.
Orie Steele: ... We see big potential into client onboarding and 
  kyc
Orie Steele: ... Trusted proof of who can sign / commit an 
  organization, as a client for onboarding...
Orie Steele: ... Further on, bring additional trust to KYC
Orie Steele: ... We also see huge applications for import / 
  export customs process for supply chain
Orie Steele: ... Both international and domestic supply chain 
  transactions with embedded LEIs
Orie Steele: ... Especially useful for working with VCs, 
  connected to the financial services... very helpfulf or supply 
  chain related payments.
Orie Steele: ... Also appliation for trusted supplier /provider 
  and member networks.
Orie Steele: ... Also payment providers where regulators are part 
  of the ecosystem...
Orie Steele: ... Sanction screening, anti-laundering and 
  counter-terrorism managment... all possible places where LEI 
  might help
Orie Steele: ... Business licenses... linking with international 
  identifiers..
Orie Steele: ... In order to share info and protect data... 
  especially in relation to things like GDPR
Orie Steele: ... Share relevant facts, support ZKPs...
Orie Steele: ... At the discresssion of the holder.
Orie Steele: ... Last oint...credential with LEI can be very 
  powerful.
Orie Steele: ... They can survive even changes to the reference 
  data that supports the LEI
Orie Steele: ...  Very helpful for organization identity
Orie Steele: ... Credential does not need to be revoked, because 
  of changes to reference data.
Carla Casilli:  Questions? [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Wayne Chang:  Lets go the q [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Manu Sporny:  Hey carla an christoff... great background... 
  curious about timeline. [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Seems like VCs are valuable to LEI... any 
  indiation of number of PoC / Pilots / Production systems?
Orie Steele: ... If its still years out, we would love to know 
  whats holding it up, challenges / features...
Carla Casilli:  We are in the middle of evaluating next steps for 
  GLEIF... [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... What role we should play moving forward...
Orie Steele: ... Closest to production is.... use case number 5, 
  payment remittance system.
Orie Steele: ... Its an existing ecosystem thats out there... our 
  PoC just adding an LEI to an existing production system
Orie Steele: ... Of course we are waiting for confirmation from 
  operators.
Orie Steele: ... Can't give you estimates... we keep finding more 
  interest.
Orie Steele: ... We joined Trust over IP as a contributor 
  member... evaluating the LEI as an ecosystem governance framework
Orie Steele: ... LEI as a solution to organizational identity in 
  digital transactions.
Orie Steele: Christoff: tech is not the gating factor, its 
  interoperability, many options in practice...
Orie Steele: ...  We don't want to make choices, we don't want to 
  exclude... so we go with several, or go with one and making it a 
  leading one
Orie Steele: ... This is why governance is important.
Heather Vescent:  Fascinatting space... can you talk about 
  trusted supplier use case, curious about supply chain, 
  auditing... re patagonia, certified fair trade... vs pharma 
  supply chain [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Carla Casilli:  We think it applies to both... [scribe assist by 
  Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... It applies to procurement processes generally
Orie Steele: ... Also useful in supplychain.
Juan Caballero: 
  https://medium.com/spherity/third-party-risk-management-a87a6dcdaf67
Orie Steele: ... We see both
