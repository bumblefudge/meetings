Use case likely dictates whether revocation list includes all issued with status, or only includes list of recoked VCs. Won't be needed in all cases, but may be in some.

+1 that we need further definition to explain how to use the status property

BTW, this is why SAML and OIDC have gone for short lived non-revocable credentials, and google chrome no longer looks up revocation lists for PKCs
Revocation raises a whole bunch of issues that are not easy to resolve and can be sidestepped by having non-revocable VCs.

I would propose a two step process. 1) Verification: check the crypto and revocation i.e. is the VC authentic and active 2) validation: does the VC match the policy rules
22:44
Dmitri Zagidulin
that is the current validation process I believe

Validation is also a multi-step process ðŸ˜ƒ
