Orie Steele: Rofl...
Qq+
Heather Vescent: Not available
Kelly Cooper: This is Kelly, I can scribe
Thanks Kelly
Kelly Cooper: Cooper
Kelly Cooper: I'm here with Rules - Drummond
I am
Kelly Cooper: Introductions: Reintroductions. First time on 
  call... This is the credentials community group of the W3c. 
  Several attendees are working with the C-19 initiative to update 
  on what we are working on. The group is new to the call. Lucy 
  Yang - C-19 Communications Stream.
Jonathan Holt: I can re-introduce myself and my new role
I used such interface about 20 years ago, rusty now. just prompt 
  me when to chime in as co-lead of the CCI Use Case workgroup.
Kelly Cooper: Eric Shiel - New to the call, works in blockchain. 
  Kevin Poulson - through C-19. Not a stranger to the group. 
  Monitors activities - discussions about digital signatures. Here 
  today about C-19 defencer.
Kelly Cooper: As part of introductions - pick one person - 
  Johnathan Holt. Medical professional - working on IP ID DID 
  method. Chief med officer of Consensys Health.
Congratulations Mr. Crunch!
Joe Andrieu: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/announcements/
Yes
Kelly Cooper: Announcements and Reminders. Upcoming event - IIW 
  next week (April 28-30). Kaliya - host IIW virtually. Begin with 
  grand opening circle - as we do IRL. Start at 8:00 PST. Co-create 
  agenda live. Infrastructure, digital with breakout rooms, demo 
  hours, fortuitous with activity going on around C-19 and 
  user-centric ways to move forward in the work.
Kelly Cooper: Kaliya-committed to accessibility. Range of prices 
  - costs $ to run virtually. Welcome everyone to join and 
  collaborate and move industry forward.

Kaliya Young: Registration - 
  https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxx-30-2020a-tickets-79016788341
Kelly Cooper: Gurvinder - intro - Founder CEO Digital Twin Labs - 
  consulting services blockchain. Previous IBM blockchain and cloud 
  unit - enterprise CTO. Has worked with, talked with others on 
  call with MIT Labs, etc.
Kelly Cooper: Adrian - announcement. Placed link to a one-page 
  summary - group is making an effort to demonstrate how people 
  will issue immunity passports - if they knew how to (if tech is 
  in place, not yet). Missing piece of credentials process because 
  the infrastructure that allows these things to interoperate and 
  create network effect probably needs to be done locally, rather 
  than at the nation level. Contact me directly, maybe discuss more 
  at IIW.
Kelly Cooper: Adrian Gropper
Joe Andrieu:

Joe Andrieu: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/114
Orie Steele: Github is sometimes down...
We just heard that on the last W3C call...
Justin Richer: GitHub is having real issues right now, and it's 
  spotty what's up and down
Kelly Cooper: Next up - quick review of action items. 1) New work 
  item proposal #114. Proposed by Anthony Ronning. emailed - 
  specification describes blockchain links as a method of 
  referencing blockchain based transactions in blocks. Former 
  message of pulling up, referencing, JSON based - URI approach to 
  referencing blockchain data. Current list of owners are Anthony 
  and Manu. Open for comments or feedback - suggestions.
Error: (IRC nickname 'anthonyronning' not 
  recognized)[2020-04-21T16:29:34.993Z]	<AnthonyRonning>	here's a 
  spec link https://www.blockcerts.org/blockchain-links/
Since github is down
Kaliya Young: Here is a new paper out today from Harvard's Ethics 
  center who is putting out a series on ethical responses to 
  COVID19. it mentions Verifiable Credentials and DIDs 
  specifically.
Kaliya Young: 
  https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/safracenterforethicswhitepaper8_01.pdf
Kelly Cooper: Formal proposal within wheelhouse, mets 
  requirements.
Kelly Cooper: Kaliya.New paper out by Harvard - mentions 
  credentials, from Center for ethics.
Kelly Cooper: Interesting proposal - concepts look similar to DID 
  methods and ideas on how to point to specific cases on the 
  ledgers. Useful specification - supports.
Yeah absolutely Chris, thank you
Kelly Cooper: Christopher A - want to quickly say team will look 
  at the coding using on DID that has blockchain lock transaction 
  and index lock within the transaction - transactions can have 
  multiple parts. Not saying use - has been vetted, it will tell 
  you where in encoding ther's an error. Could be useful (acronym 
  details missed by scribe)
Christopher Allen: +1
Kelly Cooper: Adding a comment or a label saying approved - will 
  follow up next time.
Kelly Cooper: Is there a repo or do we need to create? Yes, need 
  to create.
https://www.covidcreds.com/ - COVID Credentials Initiatives
Kelly Cooper: Moves from Action Items to Main Topic of the day - 
  several guests. Drummond - initial introductions. Lucy and group 
  are here . Once C-19 situation became serious (for all of us with 
  lockdowns), sort of a spontaneous generation throughout SSI 
  community - digital credentials we have been working on for years 
  - become important component of addressing challenges. Big thanks 
  to Tony Rose - helped get this going. Got people energized. 
  Started this community-organized
Kelly Cooper: Initiative that is now the CCI initiative. Drummond 
  involved with Rules/Governance. One workstream Coordination and 
  Communication - Lucy Yang is the leader of.
https://www.covidcreds.com/
Kelly Cooper: Lucy: Thank you Drummond. Four colleagues - four 
  workstreams of the initiative. Today, update from each workstream 
  and scope. Talk about major progress and some of the top 
  priorities. Any thoughts regarding W3 collaboration. After, 
  welcome W3 site collaboration.
Taylor Kendall:  Sporadic participant on this call. With Learning 
  Economy - around education and employment. Support mechanism. 
  Help with coordination - internal and external facing. Quick 
  high-level on Coordination. Broad overview of mission - promote 
  and legitimize SSI and Digital Identity. VC, as well as a way to 
  mitigate C-19 and reboot public trust. A lot of this started - 
  AMA Bill Gates - eventual time [scribe assist by Kelly Cooper]
Kelly Cooper: Digital certificate - test - vaccine, recovery, 
  etc. Digital Identity.
Kelly Cooper: Hope to promote use of technology and help with 
  reducing misinformation. Local and country solutions - aim to 
  support efforts, VCs, DIDs, technologies to those efforts. 200+ 
  contributors across four core workstreams.
Moses Ma: What are the four workstreams?
Kelly Cooper: Four workstreams: Communication/Coordination, Use 
  Case, Rules/Governance, Tools
Kelly Cooper: Gurvinder: Use Case - 70+ people, typically 40 on 
  call. Subgroups were organized (3), Healthcare (umbrella 
  specialty across entire CCI Initiative), SSI, Value + global 
  market and regulatory compliance.
Kelly Cooper: Calibrate requirements for adopters. Switching to 
  content of use cases: Hypotheses on certain use cases, 
  prioritized/narrowed to 2-3 use cases. Web of Trust, Proof of 
  Immunity by Exposer and Vaccine, Dedicated verified use case.
Kelly Cooper: Michael Corning - Tools workstream. 130 people 
  working - co-lead Paul Knowles. OCA and PC - one challenge - new 
  tech we don't know about due to specialization of SSI. Understand 
  geopolitical technology, then vendors, tools, technologies.
Kelly Cooper: Michael - restart Sisters, OR economy - how much 
  risk do individuals have in particular economic circumstances. 
  Conceptual ideas on Tools team is interesting and useful; 
  however, priority is if economy open too soon, what data 
  management is needed to make rational decisions instead of 
  emotional
Kelly Cooper: Tools - groups in field trying to implement. 
  Dedicated - Verified Use Case error. DELEGATED - Verified Use 
  Case.
Kelly Cooper: Establish a way to have public health authorities 
  delegate to parties and test results are credentials for digital 
  wallet, to go back to work or start transacting business.
Kelly Cooper: Tools/Technologies - working opportunities with W3 
  and DID to discuss tools and technologies - something to work 
  together and structure
Drummond Reed:  Rules/Governance With any credential solution - 
  flipside of the tech is the governance. #1 goal - interoperable 
  verifiable credentials for C-19 use cases. Rules = a primary 
  tool. The group is self-organized led by Kelly and Chris. 
  Volunteers on SGF. 40 volunteers. Early version of outline of 
  first start GF - Principles and Core Policies. Closely 
  coordinated with Use Cases as they come in the queue. And 
  coordinate policy [scribe assist by Kelly Cooper]
Kelly Cooper: Decisions relative to tools and usage. Early 
  emphasis - how do you trust Issuers? One of the first Gov 
  frameworks in Scope - how do Issuers be part of a trust community 
  and use something like a trust list, member directory, etc. How 
  can
Kelly Cooper: They be bottom - up or in different juristictions 
  top - down. One thing emphasized, due to global jurisdictions, 
  internationally represented groups.
Error: (IRC nickname 'drummond_' not 
  recognized)[2020-04-21T16:51:43.891Z]	<drummond_>	Kelly Cooper: 
  the Rules group set up 4 geo co-leads around the world. The only 
  geo missing is South America right now.
...One of the goals of the Rules group is a highly readable 
  outside of identity or digital trust professionals...
...So the group is focused on documenting the relevant use cases 
  and making it understandable to a very wide audience, including 
  regulators.
Note that will need to drop in a few mins to go to another 
  call...
Kelly Cooper: Broader reading audience - CGF Credentials 
  Governance Framework - simple documents with links to Controlled 
  Documents and additional information.
Kelly Cooper: Including DIF, Evernym, etc. Self organizing and 
  organizing initiatives. With Taylor, assemble meeting to make 
  sure we have visibility to coordinate workstreams.
Kelly Cooper: Questions?
Christopher Allen: 
  https://github.com/ChristopherA/Lists-of-High-Signal-Low-Noise-Links/blob/master/ImmunityCredentials-VerifiableClaims-COVID19.md
Kelly Cooper: Christopher A. Collecting information on location 
  privacy, immunity privacy - encourage links to specific proposals 
  and information - will add to this list. Immunity Credentials and 
  Verifiable Claims,
Kelly Cooper: Christopher A. Didn't hear from work items, work on 
  the issues of a risk model, threat analysis, ethics, law, 
  technology problems. Everything in privacy considerations is a 
  starting point for threats but 20% of problem. Unique - mostly we 
  think of threats between issuer and subject. In this case
Kelly Cooper: The Issuer, Subject, Verifiers are potentially 
  overwhelmed by public good or public harm. Much bigger problem, 
  interesting history (Ebola, Yellow Fever, HIV). Not seeing our 
  communities drive this risk model forward. Hoping with 60+ 
  companies in group, will consider.
Unfortunately I must leave the call now, but glad to have this 
  opportunity to talk with CCG.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/tree/master/docs
Thanks Chris for bringing it up! We do have a subgroup working on 
  Privacy, Data Production and other important issues. We have come 
  up with a high-level guideline while dedicated person with each 
  workstream to ensure that being implemented
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Mention this is important work. One thing 
  that is confusing - new organization - every time we add without 
  IP agreements in place, effort to allow joint discussions. 
  Current efforts underway DIF stream focusing on C-19. Also C-19 
  credentials - question may not be reachable. Want to remind the 
  importance of IP protection to contribute comfortably [scribe 
  assist by Kelly Cooper]
Moses Ma:  COVID Defender. Predictive Analytics and AI - What is 
  your time to market for your deliverables? It's a fast moving 
  situation. Good to know if work products are papers or running 
  code and when it will ship? [scribe assist by Kelly Cooper]
Orie Steele: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples/tree/master/docs/covid-19
Taylor Kendall: +1 Kim -- This has come up internally of late and 
  I agree that it's critical to address sooner than later.
Orie Steele: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/c19-vc.com
Kelly Cooper: Participating through Tools workstream Links to 
  share with the community about work happening within CCG and DIF. 
  Demo for using interoperable (call cutting out)... comfortable 
  with credential format. No submarine IP related issues. Example 
  of exact credential format with working, usable materials, for 
  operators to follow = loss in interop. Please contribute to VC 
  examples. CCG Contributor Agreement.
Kelly Cooper: Johnathan Holt - naive to IP protection. Don't hear 
  in CCI - (background noise)
Michael Herman:  Use software available now. StreetCred offered 
  free to tech to work on this problem. Can issue credentials from 
  the portal - biggest problem is connecting - ability to write 
  Sovrin Ledger - health department or whoever holding test 
  results. Challenge - how to validate that code on the street. 
  Options - QRCode - portable. Smart Cards. [scribe assist by Kelly 
  Cooper]
Moses Ma: The issue is integrating with many DOH's, and whether 
  this technology is globally deployable and scalable within a very 
  difficult time frame.
Kelly Cooper: When want to make the ability to share safety with 
  others - smart code in wallet may be most convenient way. Most 
  have smart phone. Side effect of virus may be another device at 
  all times that transmits the information - smart card of 
  immunity. Timing urgent. May not be perfect.
Kelly Cooper: Need to be aware of the details mentioned in 
  meeting - important contribution to initiative.
Joe Andrieu:  Mentioned assuming all have smart phone. Encourage 
  think of billions who don't have cell phones. A lot of work 
  around Stewards and Guardians - someone near with phone? Open 
  possibilities to everyone on the planet. [scribe assist by Kelly 
  Cooper]
Kelly Cooper: Trying to get to people tested
Eric Welton: Also - please respect the situation of verification 
  when the network is problematic - so please *NO* reliance on some 
  global ledger in some far away country.
Orie Steele: ^ Beware that a lot of the assumption around wallet 
  / credential formats only work on certain ledgers.
Moses Ma: How do we contact all of the CovidCred people on the 
  call?
Christopher Allen: Next week meeting?
