Harrison_Tang: Came on you thanks for joining.
Manu Sporny:  Hey Harrison how you doing.
Harrison_Tang: Great cool so let's start this week's wtcg meeting 
  I think some of us at our at the ietf San Francisco so they 
  couldn't make it today but I think we have corn now so today's 
  agenda is that will talk about verifiable credentials rendering 
  method thanks though thanks money and Dimitri for joining but 
  before we get to the main agenda just want to quickly go over.
Harrison_Tang:  some of the elements.
Harrison_Tang: We'll just a quick reminder on the code of ethics 
  and professional conducts just want to make sure everyone is 
  respectful to each others opinions next quick I denote anyone can 
  participate in these calls Hardware all substantive contributions 
  to any CG work items must be members of the ccg with for IP our 
  agreement signed I make sure you have a w3c account and you have 
  encounter any problems just let any of their cultures now.
Harrison_Tang:  at least meeting.
Harrison_Tang: Something went wrong with the recording and we 
  restarted right now on a second.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: All right I think the recordings on now so the 
  meetings are being recorded and it's automatically transcribed we 
  will publish the meetings and recordings and the transcription in 
  the day or two after this meeting we used to teach at to Q 
  speakers doing the call so you can type in Q Plus 2i yourself to 
  the queue or q- to remove and you can do Q question mark to see 
  who is in the queue.
Harrison_Tang:  all right.
Harrison_Tang: Actions were introductions you're new to the 
  community where you are just recently re-engaging with the 
  community please feel free to on you.

Topic: Introductions / Re-introductions

Ed Eykholt:  Oh I thought I'd say hi this is Ed I called I 
  haven't been on this call for quite a while been part of the VC 
  Community generally and using did Saint the cardano blockchain in 
  building a identity wallet for that chain.
<manu_sporny> Welcome, Ed!
Harrison_Tang: Welcome back at.
<manu_sporny> (Welcome back, that is!) :)
Harrison_Tang: Next we have announcements and reminders any 
  announcement.
Harrison_Tang: Hey money please.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah just a couple the first one is the selective 
  disclosure cryptography sweet we sorry let me collect my thoughts 
  we had asked for a demonstration of support from the community 
  for the ecb's a crypto sweet we got.
<manu_sporny> Demonstration of Support for NIST-Compliant 
  Selective Disclosure for Data Integrity Cryptosuites in VCWG: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/2023Jul/0015.html
Manu Sporny:   Not really.
Manu Sporny:  Out for that we have multiple Global standards 
  organizations also supporting the ecdsa for Selective disclosure 
  crypto Suite including gs1 Connexus which does global retail 
  standards us one that does global supply chain standards and one 
  edtech that does global education standards all using verifiable 
  credentials in json-ld and that sort of thing.
Manu Sporny:   So that's.
Manu Sporny:  As a result of that we have put out new features in 
  the ecdsa crypto sweet that the verifiable credentials working 
  group is developing so those links to those kind of pull requests 
  went out last Friday as well so that's just a heads up that 
  that's going on there a lot of that stuff is going to help.
Manu Sporny:   Help me.
Manu Sporny:  As well the the BBS crypto sweet their number of 
  selective disclosure Primitives in there that are just generally 
  useful to a variety of selective disclosure next so that's item 
  one the second item which is also good news is the rdf data set 
  canonicalization working group at the w3c is at a point where 
  their feature complete with the rdf data set canonicalization 
  work which means that we're pretty much.
Manu Sporny:   Much ready to go.
Manu Sporny:  In the can.
Manu Sporny:  Nation with that specification if folks remember 
  that is a specification that this community incubated for many 
  years before handing it over to a working group so they're going 
  into Canada Trek which basically means feature complete done we 
  have no major issues open on the spec so that's also good news.
Manu Sporny:  Good news is that the HTTP signature specification 
  that was incubated in this community for almost a decade probably 
  seven years is in working group last call at ITF so this is work 
  that Justin richer and Annabelle Bachmann have been doing they've 
  been doing fantastic work getting the specification through the 
  ITF process and we're.
Manu Sporny:   Going forward.
Manu Sporny:  No that's tough being an official ITF RFC soon we 
  use this community uses that specification for doing things like 
  invoking authorization capabilities and single shot access to 
  http endpoints that use dids as the authentication mechanism and 
  so and so forth so that's good news good news number 4 is that 
  the multi formats working group a tight.
Manu Sporny:   ETF looks like it's going to.
Manu Sporny:  Community the ccg has incubated multi hash multi 
  key multi base and both multi base and multi cash or in a charter 
  that is going to be proposed to the internet engineering Steering 
  group in two weeks time we are expecting it to be adopted and 
  that will start that works official standardization Journey.
Manu Sporny:  The ITF standards track so that's all super great 
  news right I mean those are all things that were incubated in 
  this community going to ITF going to w3c and you know getting 
  getting their way through the the process okay that's it for 
  updates from me here soon.
Harrison_Tang: Well thanks money a lot of great new so I'll reach 
  out to you and then coordinate with you on getting some of these 
  topics to our future agenda if you don't mind.
Harrison_Tang: Cool alright next we got.
Erica Connell:  Hi Harrison can you hear me.
Erica Connell:  Happy Tuesday I just wanted to make the 
  announcement that rebooting the web of trust 12 will be coming up 
  here in September will be convening in Cologne Germany from 
  September 18th to the 22nd tickets are available on Eventbrite 
  I'll drop the link in the chat that's it thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Great thanks a lot.
<econnell> rwot12.eventbrite.com
Dmitri Zagidulin: https://dwebcamp.coolab.org/
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks Dad to what Erika said the week before 
  rebooting web of trust we have the w3c T back which is the yearly 
  the most recent conference in that's going to be in Seville Spain 
  and then the week before that is going to be the first instance 
  of the D webcam conference in Brazil and I'll paste the link in 
  chat so three conferences back to back.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   And Brazil and Europe.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you any other announcements working binders.
Harrison_Tang: Any update on the work items.
Manu Sporny:  Yes there is a request in to the chairs of the ccg 
  to approve the confidence method specification so I think it's 
  kind of hanging out there and we're blocked at VC W G4 the 
  adoption of that item we have three people that have volunteered 
  to lead that item at this point I believe it's met all of them 
  and so we just need the chairs to take an action so that we can 
  move.
Manu Sporny:   Move that specification over 2.
Manu Sporny:  The ccg so that the URLs resolved so that we can 
  put some specification text into the VC data model spec.
Manu Sporny:  You have a.
Manu Sporny:  Ta I just need to tell the VC working group when 
  that's going to be done do you have an ETA on when that approval 
  might happen.
Harrison_Tang: I will sync up with Mike and Kimberly today or 
  this week and then we'll get a result.
Manu Sporny:  Excellent thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Updates on the work items.
Harrison_Tang: All right so let's get to the mint agenda so I 
  think earlier in April or May we actually approve wanted to the 
  work item verifiable credentials rendering message so the you 
  know today just very excited to have Manu and Dimitri here to 
  present and lead a discussion on this topic so money imagery the 
  floor is yours.
Manu Sporny:  Absolutely thank you so much to me.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Alright thank you so much so welcome everyone 
  we can talk about a really exciting and timely because I think a 
  lot of us VC emblem enters are hitting up against this pain point 
  right now topic which is how do you display verifiable 
  credentials so mono if it's okay with you I can go over the slide 
  deck and you feel free to jump in at any point yeah.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   All right.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Real quick let's let's add some context why 
  are we even talking about this why do we need general-purpose VC 
  display methods as you can probably guess or have already 
  encountered some issuers like universities and governments really 
  care about how their VC's look they really want them to be 
  displayed consistency consistently in wallets now.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In the VC community in a decentralized and 
  there is a sovereign sort of mindset we recognize that there's no 
  way that the issuer's can enforce or guarantee but it would be 
  nice if we had a mechanism where they could at least hint 
  politely ask hey if you don't if you don't care and you can be 
  displaying these credentials here's a template you can use and 
  the thing is for.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That sort of helped that sort of I don't have 
  to figure out how to lay out a diploma a student idea government 
  credential all that stuff as an implementer I'll welcome any help 
  I can get because displaying the verifiable credentials is one of 
  the most common.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Actions that we do with them even more common 
  than issuing in verifying the other reason that it's a really 
  relevant sort of pain point right now is of course going from 
  paper to digital and back so it a lot of use cases for example 
  James Chartrand from McMaster University who I think is here on 
  the call Hazard already ran into the this his Pilots with 
  University.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   The musing verifiable.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For diplomas and so on students are crossing 
  the borders and the Border guards don't know anything about VCS 
  they don't have any special purpose VC verifying software they at 
  best have a phone with a camera and they can scan QR codes and so 
  it's really important for student to be able to present their 
  credential in a way that's possible understandable to regular 
  people ah printed out on paper with.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   A qr-code that can work.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A general person general-purpose way without 
  specialized software.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then of course the other reason is we want 
  VC's to be able to be translated into different modes from visual 
  to audio to tactile to constrained visual environments such as 
  fed cm in the browsers.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So so what do we have like given that we need 
  to display verifiable credentials and there are just a million 
  different verifiable credentials there's a potential Infinity of 
  different types what is an implementer to do so we have a couple 
  of options Option 1 that has been popular in the pre verifiable 
  credentials world in the open badges world is to essentially 
  bake.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   A badge.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Into a static image to PNG for example and 
  embed that PNG in the badge itself right and so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's great in terms of you can get a Pixel 
  Perfect exactly how the issuer wants this thing to be speak to be 
  displayed but of course once you start displaying on different 
  screens you get into the Iran to the same challenges that 
  browsers run into with variously sized images and there's no 
  Universal standard aside from the individual standards like open 
  badges version 2 was doing or.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Or some of the other projects.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The other next two options is are the most 
  common this is 2 & 3 is what 99.9% of the wallets are doing right 
  now so any wallet that you're going to encounter they're doing 
  either 2 or 3 so 2 is you have a lot of if then statements or 
  more likely case statements that says if I encounter a credential 
  and I look and it's type field and I recognize the type of their 
  such as student ID credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I'm going to display this.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Specialized component that I put together that 
  my graphic designers sat down and wrote the react or vue.js or 
  whatever templating language you use.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Somebody at the implementer sat down and made 
  a layout and the wallet the verifier all the other software is 
  just switching off of the type do we know how to handle this 
  thing yes okay let's handle it in that way.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What happens in the most common.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You don't know how to handle a special-purpose 
  credential right we want our walls to be Universal and so chances 
  are guaranteed that you're going to encounter a credential with a 
  new type that you don't know how to layout and so far the only 
  real option that we have is to Loop through all the verifiable 
  potential properties and just list them out right think think of 
  a on ordered ordered list of keys and values.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Of course it helps if the condenser is flat 
  but the moment you have any kind of multiple levels of depth 
  becomes awkward do you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Do you laid out visually with indents do you 
  use dot notation that sort of thing so different implementers do 
  different stuff of course there is hope to be able to augment 
  this notion of just listing all of the fields by guessing at the 
  field types right that this is a string this is a date Etc by 
  other looking at the Json schema if it's specified in a 
  verifiable credential or sometimes looking at the context.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Be amazing the options that we really want to 
  be able to display credentials is again if the issue itself can 
  give us a hint could provide either a pre-baked image or better 
  yet a template a flexible template that works on different screen 
  sizes and so on that we could use.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We've got that going.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We can do all sorts of interesting things like 
  we can compile directories of common templates we can have 
  Community templates for very common verifiable credential display 
  types and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In combination with other ccg work item which 
  is known issuer and verifier lists we could add to that a third 
  thing which is no known template lists or something.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In its current Incarnation began at our W 
  everybody web trust 11 where a number of us on this call came 
  together to to write a paper on rendering verifiable credentials 
  and there's a demo video of how it works in the browser because 
  Charles little Charles laner was very kind to in the blink of an 
  eye put together a demo based on the in progress paper.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   And the paper Incorporated.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In it some of the existing credential 
  rendering proposals such as the to diff proposals while it 
  rendering and credential manifest.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then we also looked at the traceability 
  vocab again work item of this group template work right so we as 
  much as possible we try to unify and support all these existing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Ice packs and proposals and also just provide 
  a general purpose method that is flexible in the future and so 
  just recently the VC render method was adopted as a ccg work item 
  so we're very excited about that okay so what does this look 
  like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Here's of our farm credential familiar to all 
  of us this is the data model V1 but it would look exactly the 
  same in V2 we're adding an optional field called render method 
  and what is it it's an array of method hints so here's a very 
  simple one it says wallet look in the render methods and one of 
  your options is you can display this credential as an SVG.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sure conveniently put together an SVG.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Either fully rendered or a template that you 
  can fill out using.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Data from the verified credential and so it's 
  just the type the location of where you fetch it from the web or 
  better yet from your local cache.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A media type so that the wall it knows what to 
  display when and how to actually lay it out and HTML and react in 
  whatever it's using.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So that's the general types all of the 
  examples your you that you're going to be seeing will have these.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  These two or more Fields so they required the 
  ID and the type so the wall knows what to do with it and then a 
  number of optional Fields such as media type although personally 
  I do think bigger type should be required this part of the future 
  discussion so render method another top level field in the 
  verifiable credential it's optional it provides hints from the 
  issuer on how to display stuff.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Here's a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A little more complicated method taken from 
  the render method spec itself the current work item which is it's 
  got the type it's got the ID where to fetch it you've got a name 
  in case the wallets wants to present several choices to the user 
  it's got a CSS media query so that it knows how to orient it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then it's got the last field at the bottom 
  got a essentially digest hash to secure two Integrity protect the 
  contents of the credential and we're going to get into the 
  various options available there right so it's just a demonstrates 
  that the render method objects themselves the hints are fairly 
  extensible and you can get as detailed or as Bare Bones with them 
  as you would like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Here's another example.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Which is near and dear.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To our hearts over on the VC edu side which is 
  of course PDFs as I mentioned it's a credibly common pain point 
  and use case we have a digital credential we have this Json 
  object we need to turn it into a PDF how do we do that well so 
  one easy way to do that is again for the issuer to provide a PDF 
  template and templating is a common operation in the PDF World 
  Adobe writes about it and has all sorts of tools.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Tools there's.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Various programming languages on how to take a 
  PDF use it as a template and fill it out with Fields right so 
  again similar pattern as before you've got an ID which of where 
  to fetch it we've got the type media type and of course the 
  securing digest and so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Implementing wallet and I want print button on 
  a credential I look to see.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If I already have a hard-coded template then I 
  look to see if there's one in the render method.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And of course if I don't encounter one we're 
  back to guessing and what the layout should be we're back to 
  essentially.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Hang out a flat list of all of the fields in 
  the Json object which I think we can all agree is suboptimal 
  experience print wise.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay so we mentioned the digest hash so of 
  course the one of the most common questions we hear is so how do 
  we trust the template provider because it's a provider has a lot 
  of power if the wall is helpfully use the templates use the 
  rendering hints how do we trust them well.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Four methods included in the verifiable 
  credential itself.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You're relying on the same trust bottle as the 
  issuer.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If you if their signature verifies and 
  optionally the issuer is a known issue or list for you as a 
  verifier you have no reason not to also trust this other field 
  from the from the issue which is the render method right in the 
  future for Community templates we could the question of trust is 
  a little bit harder so we can reuse the exact same mechanism that 
  we do with known verifiers in issuers and then of course we 
  should always keep in mind that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   The displaying application so the wall at 
  the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Can should always feel free to override or 
  ignore the suggested rather render method because we want the 
  user to be in control we want the software developer to be in 
  control also.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So yeah so we have all of the usual mechanisms 
  for ensuring template integrity.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If you're storing the template externally your 
  you can use quote unquote trust Registries or known issue or 
  lists or you can use hash based linking you can use the already 
  mentioned digest multi based or recently the verifiable 
  credential 2.0 working group added a section to the spec called 
  Integrity of related resources which does the same thing it's a 
  it adds.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   A section to the verifiable credential that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Links to resources and provides a digest hash 
  of them.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Course the common question is so what's the 
  difference between these two methods digest multi-piece the 
  smaller so it makes for a more compact credentials but the 
  Integrity of related resources back is included in the base data 
  model verify the credential data model itself so it's going to 
  hopefully see a lot of implementation so those are the two 
  trade-off one smaller but less known other ones more verbose and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   A more standard in that it's part of the 
  specification.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then of course you can always instead of 
  using external Integrity or known lists you can just stuff the 
  entire content the entire template into the verifiable credential 
  itself just like using embedded images for example which is 
  simpler allows you to reuse the credentials own signature for 
  integrity protection but of course substantially increases the 
  size of the credential just like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Same trade-off.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Images in the BC you either hash linking or 
  you're embedding in which case it's going to be huge and 
  sometimes that's okay.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then as I mentioned before for advanced 
  reviews cases week just like with cascading style sheets this is 
  the same sort of principle we can apply a cascading series of 
  overrides where the wallet you can imagine the wallet going down 
  this list each time it wants to figure out how to render it right 
  is there a render method from the issuer or a brand owner.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   We're not going to get into.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That here it's a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Publisher and brand owner is a common topic of 
  conversation and education space.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You either use the render method from the 
  issuer or overriding it with wallet specific preferences you can 
  use trusted directories of templates and who knows maybe we'll 
  get into same thing same way that we have ringtone marketplaces 
  we could have credential display Market places although that 
  sounds nightmarish so I hope you don't get there another Advanced 
  topic that has been brought up.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Up is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Hey if we have this way of rendering 
  credentials could we.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Could we use.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The same technique to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To express a different brand identity for for 
  the issuer so if it's an international company and it's known by 
  this name in the u.s. region and it's known by a different legal 
  name for in the European region you could conceivably render it 
  as with different letterhead with different logos Etc through 
  your render method template.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   The same.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We use in internationalizing and localizing 
  verifiable credentials so again we're running into that in our 
  pilots in the edge of space where we have a Mexican University 
  that wants to issued multilingual credentials in Spanish and 
  English and as always the there's the option of do they just.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Issue two copies of the same credential one in 
  English and then the exact same potential in Spanish that is a 
  valid option and then the you hand both to the user and have the 
  user be able to present in whatever appropriate case whichever 
  one they want so that is always an option but for a lot of use 
  cases it's really convenient for the issue or to have one 
  credential that contains.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Galatians 4.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Multiple languages and fortunately the 
  verifiable credential data model has that mechanism built in you 
  can pull up the their fabric Essentials back and look at the 
  internationalisation localization section where you can see that 
  you can specify default languages you can specify you can 
  override languages per individual claim all sorts of things and 
  of course if you overdo it if you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   You offer the same potential in 20 different 
  languages.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It increases the size and similarly if you are 
  on top of translation are doing different render methods based on 
  regions that can come in at or really interact with translation 
  and just make for a really huge Reese's so it's an advanced topic 
  but I just wanted to add it and this is just an example a mock 
  exam.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   I love that what that would look like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This one uses the disc credential manifest 
  rendering hint based on the disc back but adds the language and 
  the region jurisdiction tag.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So that while I could select.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Which render method to display based on that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Quick side note in the v-spec directory of 
  course it since it's a item.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I'm going to say it's the ccg item but it's 
  not it's the VC working group item well okay so for those who may 
  not be familiar.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Aside from the main VC data model 2.0 spec the 
  new DC working group also has this extension mechanism list of 
  sub specifications and proposals from the community that involve 
  verifiable credentials so there are separate specs for different 
  proof methods there are specs for their detailed specifications 
  for existing VC Fields like status like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Ants and of course.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Channel their fiber credential properties such 
  as the render method so the render method is a perfect example of 
  an item that lives in the VC specification directory again these 
  are just some of the examples of what lives in their side from 
  the proof methods we've got this render method based on the paper 
  and and further work with Community we've got this notion of 
  composable credential using digest multi based and then we have.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   The verifiable issuers and verifier.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That is also a really exciting development in 
  the community and we're going to pause here for funds and money 
  if you want to add anything.
Manu Sporny:  Oh you did such a wonderful job to me treat I have 
  next to nothing to add that was that was fantastic I guess one 
  thing that I wanted to go back to that you had mentioned was kind 
  of accessibility needs so as many of you in the education space 
  or you know if you work with governments know their requirements 
  to make the things you create.
Manu Sporny:  Compliant with people's accessibility means so if 
  people have sight accessibilities or hearing accessibility needs 
  our.
Manu Sporny:  Most useful you know verifiable credential that 
  only has a visual depiction is problematic for someone that can't 
  see and so that's where you would want something like a render 
  method that would render to audio so that if they were to use you 
  know an accessible device to get such a verifiable credential 
  that it would be read out loud to them instead of them just not 
  being able to you know interact with the system.
Manu Sporny:   Bottom so there's.
Manu Sporny:  A lot of Hope and promise I think in the 
  accessibility community that the work that we're doing here in 
  the verifiable credentials Community will one Empower you know 
  people with accessibility needs with with digital credentials 
  that also you know cater to the needs that they have so all that 
  to say governments have requirements around accessibility if.
Manu Sporny:   The issue.
Manu Sporny:  Until they have to be able to say that they're 
  doing it in a way that does not marginalize you know communities 
  in render method is is one of the mechanisms that can be used to 
  kind of achieve that but other than that Dimitri that was 
  fantastic you hit on every major Point associated with this work 
  thanks.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Harrison I think you're up next.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I would imagine a lot of issuers with Brands 
  like they want to have some kind of assurance that you know their 
  credentials and you know basically our display in a consistent 
  manner where a manner that they approve right so like for example 
  I would imagine a hypothetical situations like DMVs don't want 
  like California DMV is don't want their driver license to display 
  in different ways by different.
Harrison_Tang:  my wallet or different presenters.
Harrison_Tang: Is there a way to for the issuers to have that 
  kind of assurance that the presenters and walnuts are displaying 
  these you know verifiable credentials were badges in a consistent 
  manner.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Great question great question I and it sounds 
  like I'm on also wants to give an answer but I'll answer real 
  quick that this is a social and legal problem and not a technical 
  one because there's no technical way to enforce even in theory 
  consistent display because that's essentially a form of DRM 
  there's no way to absolutely guarantee it but there are much like 
  with DRM there are certainly legal.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Highly encouraged on the one end and punished 
  on the other and so then it becomes a notion of the issuer's 
  regulate or convince software providers to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  When you encounter a credential from me and 
  maybe we can add different types or watermarks to the render 
  method property when you encounter this credential you better 
  display it as such right so when when doing the negotiation of 
  which wallet too.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Issue the credential to and requiring the 
  various wallet data stations because we certainly don't want to 
  issue based on.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  While provider companies know we want while 
  it's to be able to give generica at a stations so that's one 
  mechanism that issuers could use to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To enforce that Manu where you have a leaky to 
  answer the question go ahead.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah yeah I mean yes but +12 everything you said 
  Dimitri there's a really interesting Dynamic that's happening 
  here in render method is kind of that the one of the it's kind of 
  like the tip of the iceberg right it's the easiest to kind of try 
  and in tackled so what Dimitri was saying we are company engages 
  with state and federal governments.
Manu Sporny:   It's in.
Manu Sporny:  Very concerned about their citizen credentials 
  being displayed in a way that they do not approve of the other 
  thing that they're concerned about is that when their credential 
  is displayed they're concerned that the person looking at the 
  display is not actually going to be believed it's a valid 
  credential right so so one they're very very concerned about the 
  brand and image of you know the state being upheld when the.
Manu Sporny:   NG is displayed and they're also concerned that 
  when the.
Manu Sporny:  Blade is the person looking at it going to believe 
  it if it's a legitimate ID right so those are I mean that is very 
  much going into like the current thinking of you know States and 
  governments in large organizations issuing credentials they 
  they're you know they're their marketing and branding teams want 
  strong control over how the thing is rendered but at the same 
  time in this is this is kind of the thing that fights counter to 
  it.
Manu Sporny:   It they want open the ecosystems they want like 
  open wall.
Manu Sporny:  Them's and so you know the conversation like it 
  kind of goes like this it's like you know the government says hey 
  we want an open Wallet ecosystem and we're like great you know 
  the VC you know ecosystem is an open can be an open Wallet 
  ecosystem but then the next statement is but we really want to 
  make sure that when somebody renders our credential it looks 
  exactly like this and then we're kind of like well you and have 
  an open Wallet ecosystem but you can't simultaneously.
Manu Sporny:   Obviously also.
Manu Sporny:  And then and then you know the large organizations 
  are like oh well then we're going to vet our writers and only 
  allow certain wallet providers to hold our credentials and at 
  that point we were like okay well you're not quite an open Wallet 
  ecosystem of that point right if you if you lock it down to only 
  a few you know wallet providers now the counter did that is 
  exactly what Dimitri said it's make it so that the wallets can 
  provide at a station's General out of stations not like.
Manu Sporny:   Like I am you know a wallet from giant big.
Manu Sporny:  X and therefore you can trust you no trust me that 
  I'm going to do the right thing with the credential so render 
  method is like right in the middle of that there's this push and 
  pull on open Wallet ecosystems but still being able to you know 
  render things in a certain way that same push and pull has to do 
  with like key management and Security in when you're allowed to 
  like share the credential and so on so forth so this is all.
Manu Sporny:   Like kind of tip of the.
Manu Sporny:  That we're dealing with in the in the digital 
  community so that's it you know it's a it's a great you know 
  question Harrison I think we're all still trying to figure out 
  you know what the right balance is I think many of us do not want 
  to sacrifice and open Wallet ecosystem you know that's the 
  primary you know we're talking about self so I'm an identity 
  we're talking about individuals having the right to own their 
  data once you start imposing limits on that individual about 
  which wallets.
Manu Sporny:   That they can use your now down a slippery slope 
  to.
Manu Sporny:  Big Tech providers potentially nudging people 
  towards their solution which is not you know as open as the as 
  the an open Wallet ecosystem that's it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks Mondo and just to add to that real 
  quick so we're the other thing to keep in mind is that we already 
  live in this world in a lot of aspects information look at the 
  browser the user always can change the CSS of any website even if 
  it's a government website even if it's a if it's Coca-Cola or 
  some other brand that really cares about their branding I can as 
  a user pull up their site change the color scheme.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Has the fonts to Papyrus I know.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I think I.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah there's no.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's no technological way to prevent me 
  from doing that unless you get into horrible DRM territory but of 
  course in real credentials this becomes a lot more relevant and 
  so yeah that's what it stations are for.
Harrison_Tang: Thanks Phil you're next.
Phil_L_(P1): Yeah thanks to great presentation mono and and 
  Dimitri this is kind of following on your your section of more 
  advanced topics and I'm curious about the use cases where the 
  display actually wants to combine information from different 
  credentials into a common display of some sort I know that you 
  know adobe's working on that and and there are other approaches 
  to considering how to do that but I wonder if you given that.
<manu_sporny> "Great presentation" was definitely all Dmitri :) 
  -- I'm just a semi-useless appendage attempting to support Dmitri 
  here.
Phil_L_(P1): She can talk a little bit about what is what is 
  being done out there either by Adobe or others who do you think 
  would be relevant thanks.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh what a great question so I'll touch on 
  Adobe separately Mana do you think it makes sense to provide an 
  example from the a drip irrigation world.
Manu Sporny:  Sure and if so in what way maybe you could start 
  off Dimitri and then I could I can pull up.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah yeah so so so we have an example of 
  exactly this fill in a traffic in true age credentials where the 
  credentials are composable that there is a there's an outer 
  container credential that hash links to smaller different 
  credentials that there's an overall container that links to a 
  person's picture.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To their age category.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And so essentially if the triage system wanted 
  a consistent way of here is how you take these three credentials 
  and compose them together visually that's that's definitely 
  something that they could put in a template.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Staple that template to zoo container 
  credential and use that now like you said it's definitely a 
  advanced usage Mana go ahead.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah that's exactly right Dimitri I think Phil you 
  know one of the one of the challenges here with like mult 
  rendering of multi credentials is that if you're pulling the data 
  from outside of the credential like like for example as Dimitri 
  said if you hash linked to stuff that rendering language will be 
  more complex right I mean it it will need to understand how to 
  pull in all these.
Manu Sporny:   He's different credentials and.
Manu Sporny:  I'm kind of form it is it is absolutely doable like 
  that is that it's a doable thing but it is technically 
  complicated so if you were to look at something that for too kind 
  of as to provide it easier example to implement if you were 
  looking for something that had a had like a top-level credential 
  subject and then a whole bunch of other credentials embedded in 
  that credential where all of the data was local you know it was 
  signed you know hash like but it was all.
Manu Sporny:   Local that type of rendering is much easier to 
  accomplish.
Manu Sporny:  I think we're very much early days when it comes to 
  like rendering of complex compound credentials in you know 
  there's there's quite a bit of work that that needs to be done 
  there I think probably the first set of like quick wins is going 
  to be in the some of the simpler use cases so foreign to give you 
  an example Dmitry was talking about you know the true age program 
  the true age program utilizes a compound credential so it's.
Manu Sporny:   Got this outermost.
Manu Sporny:  For that's got you know an individual's picture but 
  that individuals picture it never it never leaves their wallet 
  the true age program never sees like the the you know the photo 
  of the person the only thing the true age program you know gets 
  is like a driver's license number which is then immediately 
  tokenized in like ee encrypted and locked away and what you're 
  left with is are these random numbers the the tokens the true age 
  tokens which are.
Manu Sporny:   Rendered as cue.
Manu Sporny:  Right so the oh that the individual has you know in 
  their digital wallet is this compound can credential that 
  contains a bunch of different things that can be a bunch of 
  different random numbers 90 B random numbers that can be rendered 
  as a QR code which is a verifiable credential so one of the one 
  of the big challenges with version 1 of true age that's that's 
  out there today is that we told the wallets that they have to 
  render the QR code like.
Manu Sporny:   They have to take the binary and converting.
Manu Sporny:  You see bore LD and then as a QR code and that was 
  before render method existed you know today if we had to do it 
  again we would have just used render method and say hey here's a 
  peers of PNG that you need to show on the screen so when they go 
  to display it the wallet doesn't have to have all this 
  complicated logic about you know how to how to transform to see 
  more LD and how to take that to a QR code instead just say oh 
  I've got a render method here I'm just going to render this as an 
  image.
Manu Sporny:   Each right so that's an example of like the way we 
  used to kind of address this problem.
<dmitri_zagidulin> link to the slides: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O3nOA1K8HcwJAKVdqO0AVF1hOkL1xPJOiWuxeoVrJlk
Manu Sporny:  And if render method you know gets traction and and 
  you know people start using it we would have a much simpler way 
  to try and address the problem but going back to your compound 
  credential problem I think that's still a hard problem like we're 
  very early days and trying to figure out how that could work.
Phil_L_(P1): Dimitri do you want to expand on what is going on 
  elsewhere there.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh yeah so I think the only other thing that I 
  would add to that is this notion of compound credentials is so 
  it's it's deployed into age and it's an item of great interest in 
  the education space because we have these CLR V2 we have this 
  comprehensive learner record which is a kitchen sink for laundry 
  list of all your achievements as a student in one big compound 
  there.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Bible credentials it doesn't use hash links 
  it embeds all the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Rolls into one outer one and again that's a 
  lot of the wallets are going to be wrestling with how do we 
  display that.
Phil_L_(P1): And in the forecast for the possibilities for using 
  something from the PDF world to accomplish some of this.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh okay yeah so let's say we've got we've got 
  a few minutes let's talk about the big EF world but ma no go 
  ahead we got the cue.
Manu Sporny:  I was I was gonna say you know render method the 
  way it's the way that it's it's contemplated right now is kind of 
  like attached to the verifiable credential right but Dimitri also 
  highlighted some really interesting that we could maybe decouple 
  it from the verifiable credential like have rendering templates 
  for presentations or have a rendering like a rendering template 
  for a CL R V2 would.
Manu Sporny:   Be simultaneously.
Manu Sporny:  The easy and difficult to do because because 
  rendering you know like if we took like an SVG thing like it's 
  not programmatic like you know a CLR has like a bunch of 
  different classes in it and you know if you wanted some kind of 
  generalized rendering mechanism I don't I don't think it would be 
  easy to do for for cl are in kind of like a generative way right 
  but if we take a step back and look at render method as like this 
  is.
Manu Sporny:   Is a design pattern.
Manu Sporny:  In maybe what we can do is just in time render 
  templates that would take in a CL R V2 in create programmatically 
  create an SVG that could be used to render a CL R V2 or render a 
  presentation like let's say somebody shows up with like you know 
  they're they're getting a job and they show up with like driver's 
  license and utility bill to demonstrate that there are person 
  that exists that's recognized by you know government and.
Manu Sporny:   Leti companies in they show up with a couple of 
  open badges.
Manu Sporny:  Create a render template that takes all of that 
  information and then renders it to the screen like if that is a 
  common set of things that people provide your organization your 
  software developers and designers might say oh we're going to 
  create a render template for this particular type of presentation 
  again early days who knows you know where that's going to go but 
  it's certainly a possibility.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Harrison go go ahead you're on the queue.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah quick question on this cl cl are like is it 
  does this compound presentation just show a bunch of credentials 
  like as it is or it doesn't attempt to kind of merge all the 
  different like elements you know so for example is the elements 
  for of age like shows I mean different credentials is it trying 
  to merge and do conflict resolutions.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Great question well so yeah nobody knows 
  because literally that question a bunch of developers are in 
  board rooms right now arguing about how to do that so how did 
  there's no standard yet it's every wallet implementers is trying 
  to figure out how to do this.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thanks.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay so let's say a few words about PDFs so 
  does the general pattern verifiable credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  On how do you secure external binaries so we 
  know how to secure with a Json object and having found XML 
  objects but what about how do I secure a PDF or a PNG or I don't 
  know word doc.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Ways to do that I can either.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is your regular verifiable credential familiar 
  Json object and hash linked to the binary resource that's 
  fundamental option one and then fundamental option two is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If the binary file has a separate metadata 
  option I can.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I can hash link the contents of the of the PDF 
  and put it in the separate PDF metadata.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That everybody a file has and so Adobe has a 
  way of doing that it's called C2 PA it's something something 
  content protection Alliance and it's a way to say here's how you 
  hash the contents of a PDF here are the metadata fields that you 
  can use for this so could you theoretically.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Embed a verifiable credential in the metadata 
  of the PDF yes I don't think anybody's done that yet Adobe 
  themselves is building in the tooling for the cgpa into PDF 
  viewer Photoshop all these different things I don't think they're 
  using verifiable credentials that I think they're they're using 
  their own digital signatures.
Phil_L_(P1): They actually have a verifiable credential 
  subsection for how to do it that way and I'll put it in the 
  technical specs are taking the technical spec Doc in the chat.
<phil_l_(p1)> c2pa technical spec 
  https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Excellent yeah but that's a that's a slightly 
  different problem it's not a different problem it's just a 
  complementary way of doing it so you can either issue a 
  standalone verifiable credential and use the render method 2 
  points to a PDF which is the printed version of that or you can 
  do the opposite which is if your PDF and then embed a verifiable 
  credential into its metadata so those are the yin and yang.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I'm dealing with PDFs and other binary objects 
  any other quick questions I've got two minutes till the top of 
  the hour.
Harrison_Tang: No I think we're good so thanks Dimitri thanks 
  money for a great presentation today.
Dmitri Zagidulin: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O3nOA1K8HcwJAKVdqO0AVF1hOkL1xPJOiWuxeoVrJlk
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks everyone cheers Harrison here's the 
  here's the link to the slides if you want to mail it out.
Harrison_Tang: I would do that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  On the agenda or whatever okay cool.
Harrison_Tang: Great I will do that thanks then the tree and yeah 
  I think this concludes this week's GG meaning so thanks for it 
  thanks everyone for attending.
