Patrick St-Louis:  What is the way to address which crypto suites 
  to use
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Issue 506, discussion ongoing. VCDM 1.1 
  deals with signing with jws was done a specifically, blocked by 
  migrating to VCDM 2.0, which should be stable and head to LTR 
  sometime soon. What we resolved to is once VCDM 2.0 is 
  ready/published we will migrate. TLDR, we are sticking with 2018 
  until migration.
