<div onmouseout="$('#link-2').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-2').show()" id="2" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  On the agenda today is just an agenda review which is what we&apos;re doing right now introductions and reintroductions if we need any we will then move on to relevant Community updates spend five minutes on that look at to pull requests around workflow apis and hope to try to at least have a tiny bit of discussion there put 30 minutes to it but we can move on from it if. <a id="link-2" style="display:none;" href="#2">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-3').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-3').show()" id="3" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don&apos;t want to dwell on that and then finally we&apos;ll be doing some issue processing as time allows and then any other business folks one are there any updates or changes to the agenda anybody want to talk about anything else today? <a id="link-3" style="display:none;" href="#3">✪</a></div>

<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Relevant Community Updates</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-6').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-6').show()" id="6" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Okay no introductions are reintroductions relevant Community updates does anybody have anything that the group should know about with respect to VC API or protocols or anything in general happening in the in the API space around verifiable credentials. <a id="link-6" style="display:none;" href="#6">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-7').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-7').show()" id="7" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  All right no updates there just forgot to mention that the verifiable credential 11 spec the final date to vote on that is today if you have not voted in favor of publishing it as an updated wreck please please do so it doesn&apos;t have a lot of boats on it and for those of you that can see the votes you&apos;ll see some very interesting commentary by a very big company. <a id="link-7" style="display:none;" href="#7">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-8').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-8').show()" id="8" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  It&apos;s on a good track it&apos;s just, anyway take a look -- <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/vc-11-2021-corrections/results">https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/vc-11-2021-corrections/results</a> <a id="link-8" style="display:none;" href="#8">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()" id="10" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I guess it&apos;s worth mentioning that interrupts going to be a big part of this year with respect to kind of be Capi in some of the other stuff that we&apos;re doing in other spaces in I expect us to probably have an interop discussion not next week but the following week just to cover cover some interrupt things. <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Pull Requests</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Dimitri I shared a link in the ccg minute sorry I don&apos;t have it in front of me right now but you should be able to find it in the Raw logs public logs there. <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;manu_sporny&gt; Define Workflow APIs - <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api/pull/255">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api/pull/255</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Right on to pull request so the first pull request is about the workflow apis so just to remind everyone on the last call we talked in the fair amount of detail about the non-normative workflow API things it just you know the messages. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   You know going back and forth. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Around credential refresh and how that could be generalized this PR pull 255 covers actually let me go ahead and share my screen here. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  This PR covers a realization of that API so it actually defines it so PR 255 basically takes the non-normative text that we had last time moves it into a new section on workflows it adds two endpoints and defines them in open API specification. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  It identifies that we&apos;re talking about generalizations to the exacting to the existing VC API and then it provides two diagrams one of them is the generic VCA Pi flow this kind of back and forth showing how the workflow calls are made so you basically request to start a workflow a verifiable. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Issuer/Verifier can request  information for from you in a way of interacting and then you respond back to that with a verifiable presentation with the things that for example the issuer asked for or the verifier asked for and then once the receiving app that you sure the verifier processes the information they let you know. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  How it went so they&apos;ll either give you a new verifiable credential if you&apos;re refreshing or they&apos;ll say hey thanks I got that data looks good to me or they&apos;ll kick back an error or they&apos;ll say hey I need more information with you within additional interaction request there so there&apos;s a generalized flow in the spec now in that generalized flow is the exact same thing that we have proposed in the refresh spec. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Refresh is a specialization of the generalized flow in the in the VC API PR that&apos;s here let&apos;s see let me see if I can get a preview so the new section is here under workflows. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There are two endpoints workflows the name and start and then workflows in an active workflow ID and presentations so you either start a workflow and then you&apos;re asked to give it some data and you post the data at the presentations and point in these two are just kind of like works-in-progress the naming whether or not this is a design pattern or an actual endpoint URL still to be determined the interaction thing, here is the same one that you saw in the previous screen. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  And then it&apos;s just got a whole bunch of you know it has the examples of the thing that we talked about last time it also talks about the start workflow here and it&apos;s got you know Json schema on validating it and Response Center codes and things of that nature so that&apos;s that PR 255 let me pause. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Any questions or concerns I see Mike&apos;s provided some feedback Marcus you provided some feedback and enough you&apos;ll want to elaborate on that here. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Go ahead Justin. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  There we go so my main question with this is that if that hey I need to get the user involved thing and a Marxist comment I think it was starts to touch on this can be abstracted in tough to be able to act as a jumping off point for a variety of different systems because this it it very much feels like WWW-Authenticate header style thing. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  You&apos;re basically saying I can&apos;t fulfill this request but here&apos;s the information that you need in order to go do some to do a different protocol to fulfill the request that you want right because it is it is about API access and that is an API response and this I think from my perspective is where Adrian&apos;s questions of meshing with things like GNAP really come into play where things like you know did come messaging and stuff really come into play is is in that part of the step. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yes that is absolutely correct in what you just said is where the next PR picks up so the next PR talks about interaction and bootstrapping and other protocols and you know I can&apos;t do anything with you here you need to go over there style interaction so that is not. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The pr here is just kind of a general kind of structure but I think your comments Justin apply more to like interact if interact comes back and says I need you to go somewhere else and do something else I think that&apos;s where the majority of your comments apply if you just you know if all if all the response then you can just respond. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Clean that you know that could be the end of it. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  So I would actually like to push back on that and ask why that is a different thing because in both cases you are telling the client here&apos;s something that I need from you. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah and so maybe it&apos;s not a different thing. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  And that&apos;s as so that&apos;s basically that&apos;s how we&apos;re treating it in cap and which is where so which is where I think that there are some similarities in the pattern here whether or not there&apos;s overlap and then abstraction in the protocol I think you know remains we figured out but this similarity is that I&apos;m seeing in the pattern are are around that type of thing where sometimes. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  You talk to somebody else and go do a whole other protocol and then get back to you with something sometimes you just want them to answer a question that you&apos;re asking directly give me a verifiable presentation that answers. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  This query or what have you. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Justin Richer</span>:  But they&apos;re materially very similar there&apos;s semantically identical things where even though the process for fulfillment is very different. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yep yep so I think we need to kind of as a group drill into that and see if there&apos;s stuff here we can simplify or if there&apos;s overlap where we can remove you know unnecessary differentiation and things of that nature Adrian you&apos;re on the queue. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Adrian Gropper</span>:  That was quick so having spent about a decade in the UMA context and then watching the healthcare people go and invent something called you&apos;d App instead of adopting Boomer or looking forward to good nap I&apos;m very sensitive to what Justin just said so I&apos;ll just leave it at that. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Adrian Gropper</span>:  There with what good app is now fixing that was not fixed before and the the healthcare specific approach I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to catch on even in healthcare but they&apos;re doing it. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;mprorock&gt; &lt;sarcasm&gt;god forbid we recognize that this is a pre-standard, work in progress, commit stuff, then move move forward and improve&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  All right thanks for that input Adrian okay if there are no other comments on this PR please take a look at it and tell us what you think of it that sort of thing the next PR up is in a different repo but this goes to what Justin was. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Was speaking to. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Is you might want to bootstrap into another protocol or they may be another protocol that comes into effect so in the verifiable presentation request spec which a number of vendors are using in this space like the traceability folks digit bizarre uses it there is a section on interaction so last I think it was a week or so ago. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  For mediated presentation, you need a human being to step in and do something or you don&apos;t need a human being to step in and you can just respond through HTTP that takes basically verifiable presentation right so those are the two things that we had before but interaction as we talked about last week has you can provide a whole bunch of different ways of interacting in these are usually known as. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   Has different protocols. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  And so when you say I want to start a workflow in the response comes back to you in it there can be an interaction interact mechanism and it could for example be an open IDC credential provider interact mechanism where it expects you to then bootstrap into an open IDC credential provider approach so this is the work that matter has been working on. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  To respond using open ID Connect credential provider there&apos;s a it says I understand that and you can go here to do that or if you wanted to interact in communicate over did calm so you wanted to switch from VC API into did Cam you have that capability through this Edition and you can list multiple interaction mechanisms so you can respond. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Just through VC API you can respond with open IDC credential provider you can do respond with did calm in the receiving server the issuer for example supports all three protocols or two or whatever you know it is so this PR is meant to demonstrate that we could bootstrap into other protocols. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Through you know verifiable presentation request it tells you how it can interact now clearly the market it&apos;s best for the market if we could agree on one thing you know simpler if it solves all the use cases you know simpler security characteristics less code to go wrong you know all that kind of stuff but what we&apos;re trying to do here is kind of show. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:   All the different wallet. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Two calls that there is a way to go about this where not everyone has to choose to die on their own Hill right it&apos;s a we can at least agree to the mechanism in which we then bootstrap into a separate protocol which you know is is one way that we could go about this so This PR is pretty simple it just adds the oid see credential. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  Hi there can you hear me oh super first time using Safari here okay my question on the flow this is the the holder reaches out to the issuer in the very first call in order to get this message back that says how the issuer can interact correct for all cases. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Varley</span>:  Yep yep no I can see it. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yes yeah that&apos;s correct can you can you see my screen I&apos;ll try and point so on the on the diagram step one is so this is the generic flow but it lets assume holder on the left issue or on the right if holder reaches out to an issuer and says I want to start this workflow the issuer can respond back with that&apos;s great here&apos;s the information I need from you and here&apos;s how you can interact with me in that at that point. <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
