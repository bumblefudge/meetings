<danielle_saunders> trying to use the microphone - I'm Danielle 
  Saunders
Danielle_Saunders: Okay I figured it out sorry about that.
Danielle_Saunders: Morning everyone I just wanted to say hello um 
  Colin asked me to do um a quick um show and tell of something I'm 
  working on so I thought I'd say hello at the top of the call and 
  you'll hear from me soon.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: A awesome thank you.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh hello everybody share my 
  screen.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Is that coming through okay.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Wonderful um well hello everyone.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Um let's see Eric.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Had himself to the queue.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Hey Eric did you want to share 
  something.
Eric_Shepherd: No sorry that was a mistake for Colin sorry.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: All good um well uh my name is 
  Colin Reynolds I work with education Design Lab uh regular some 
  some faces or names uh.
<ildiko_mazar> In the meantime, the 'Housekeeping' survey can be

  Thanks for your contributions.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: The chat today and uh see some 
  other new ones I've been attending these these calls for a few 
  years now usually um learning alongside everyone else and 
  learning from all of you uh so very excited to share some of the 
  work that that I've been up to with education Design Lab uh form 
  way works with learning economy foundation and in the first 15 
  years of my career were spent in uh schools as a classroom 
  teacher and administrator uh of all ages mostly Elementary Middle 
  School um but now have been in this space for the last handful of 
  years um and excited to share some of the projects we've been 
  working on so like to put a little context around it I wanted to 
  give a brief overview of Education Design Lab and the work that 
  we do and then we'll get into some of the projects uh and and 
  then I'll hand it over to Danielle to talk about uh 1 of the the 
  tools that we've created to support some of our partners in this 
  work.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Now if you have any questions feel 
  free to just throw them in the chat uh there's a a slide for Q&A 
  but uh we can just take them as we go as well.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: All right so so we are a national 
  nonprofit based in the United States uh the home base was 
  Washington DC prior to the pandemic and and then the lab became 
  uh a remote company or remote group that works with colleges 
  universities in other organizations including employers and 
  increasingly more work with employers uh around um designing 
  testing and building new models and approaches to solving 
  challenges for uh individuals that need them most we usually talk 
  about uh the new majority Workforce which are typically um.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: First generation college students 
  uh or non non-degree college students but we work alongside very 
  closely with community colleges uh increasingly more estate 
  education groups uh State Workforce boards uh and other 
  organizations to help really kind of build ecosystems of 
  solutions.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So we a lot of the work is done 
  designing uh micro Pathways with post-secondary groups again 
  currently our work is mostly based in the US we have been 
  increasingly learning from many that are on the call here and a 
  lot of the modeling what uh been going on in Europe with the Euro 
  pass and a lot of the other projects um specifically in the way 
  that that the standards are being uh incorporated into Solutions 
  so some of the work we're going to talk about uh explicitly 
  States uh some of the technical standards that we are hoping our 
  partners are are checking for or or requesting as they're looking 
  at credent in and using data to help support their Learners and 
  employers import uh supporting their earners.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh so we'll talk a little bit 
  about some of the how we approach this work with higher education 
  Partners we talk about a digital discoverability strategy um that 
  includes learning an employment records uh other forms of 
  verified credentials um we we also do some work with employers 
  under what's becoming more talked about in the states as skills 
  first to work or skills-based hiring in advancements skills are 
  really becoming uh a very uh common topic for policy makers state 
  boards State education boards um and groups working to try to 
  find ways to get people into jobs without having the 4 year to 
  degree requirement or 2 year degree requirement be the standard 
  so they talk a lot about that work is skills based and skills 
  first and and then I'll share a little bit about a project that 
  we are leading with the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation uh 
  called experience you.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: How we can we can chat a little 
  bit about some of those projects and then want to hand it over to 
  Danielle to talk about the tool that we uh are using most 
  actively to support our higher education Partners in navigating 
  this whole world.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So I threw on the Lear slide I 
  think many here know what a knower is but when we work with our 
  partners we end up finding ourselves in the place of of educating 
  them on uh just what an ler is exactly and what it isn't and how 
  they can think about it inside of a bigger strategy but the the 
  idea of an ler being an employment record is uh increasingly um 
  common in the approach uh to our work and and our partners often 
  come to us and ask for support in building an ler or you know 
  what is and what is in an oer so we really talk about it as a a 
  collection of of All Digital records uh and and the experience 
  you project that I'll share a little bit more about is taking 
  past uh experiences employment and learning and helping to 
  credential them in a way that would allow individuals to bring 
  their past experiences forward into this digital realm because a 
  lot of the work that happens is uh focused on current uh issuance 
  of credentials and and moving forward.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  uh not many organizations.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Ations think about how.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Issue for past experiences to 
  include those in into a learning and employment record.
<laura_paglione> Will you be sharing the slides or the links that 
  are on the slides?
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So in in the work that we do I 
  mentioned it it being more about digital discoverability and a 
  strategy we we keep the humans at the center of all the work that 
  we do so at Design Lab really focuses on human centered and 
  Equity centered design we have a lot of tools and processes for 
  centering the the problem statements and solutions statements 
  with those individuals in in mind so we we've done a a we've done 
  a ton of work across a variety of states in the US um but the 
  common theme Here is that the humans are the focus uh so when we 
  think about a skills-based ecosystem we look at micro credentials 
  and credentials digital badges whatever you want to call them 
  they all have sort of different nuances to them but Micro 
  credentials sit at the core of of the L which should be stored 
  inside a digital wallet where an individual has some ownership 
  and ability to Port those credentials to places that are going to 
  help find help them find Value and opportunity in a skills based 
  ecosystem but it's it's incredibly important.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  in our work.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Center that with the humans that 
  are being impacted by it so it involves a lot of design sessions 
  with employers with higher education partners with Learners with 
  earners and um a combination of all of them together.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So with micro credentials in mind 
  the lab created a set of durable skills micro credentials um that 
  have competencies these are the the 9 main competencies there are 
  sub competencies associated with them and this set of durable 
  skills we also developed a set of learning uh modules and 
  assessments that help to uh basically credential existing 
  experience for individuals so the the tools called X credit uh 
  the X credit assessments that's a whole separate presentation 
  that this group may be interested in uh but the xcredit really 
  helps our partners think about ways that they can uh validate uh 
  these skills and competencies in the context of whatever industry 
  they're working in and so there's a lot of different applications 
  for it in the assessments that have been created are are very 
  rigorous assessments at a research base uh they're they're 
  scenario based so you can imagine an individual going through 
  sort of a a mock problem solution.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Dialogue with another human in a 
  virtual setting uh if you could go as far as you know putting it 
  into a VR Set uh to engage in that as well but that um.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: This is a way that we work with 
  our partners to help talk about and sort of calibrate around what 
  we mean when we say durable skills or soft skills and uh how we 
  can teach those skills explicitly and assess them and award 
  credentials to represent those competencies.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So this I I know is a probably a 
  little overwhelming of a visual but when we talk with our higher 
  education Partners or increasingly more with employers about what 
  we mean when we say digital discoverability and skills visibility 
  what we're really trying to do is help identify skills that 
  individuals are learning in specific contexts and how we can make 
  those skills visible inside of the larger ecosystem for employers 
  to find and for individuals to be able to see I think that's been 
  a a real uh powerful part of the work that we do with with 
  Partners is that.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Go through these process are they 
  collect credentials they get a better sense of the skills that 
  they actually have which helps them navigate their conversations 
  and interview processes and application processes for new jobs 
  but when we work with Partners we we start talking about the 
  skills and we want to make sure that we have identified the 
  skills that are happening and align those uh skills to the 
  learning experiences that are going on whether it's on campus or 
  in a work-based uh learning environment internships 
  apprenticeships what have you or combination of all those things 
  so in order to make those skills visible we need to use well in 
  this case credentials and verified credentials help to document 
  those and attach assessment uh attach evidence so that when they 
  take them in their l in their wallet to a Marketplace they're 
  able to bring those to the surface.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh so this is an example of what 1 
  of those micro Pathways might look like um so this was uh created 
  with the burrow of Manhattan Community College uh we do this work 
  with I think we're actively working with uh about 40 community 
  colleges across the country um again mostly focused around Stars 
  which are those who are skilled through alternative routes so 
  many of these are non-degree programs often non-credit programs 
  as well that are focused on industry certifications High need or 
  in need job positions um inside of specific regions in States so 
  we work with the the both ends of the spectrum so the employers 
  that would be hiring these individuals and the colleges and 
  education institutions which is increasingly moving into high 
  school for some of the dual enrollment programs um as well we run 
  through design sessions to help identify the experiences that 
  individuals need to have you can see the 21st uh.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  Century or Dior.
<sharon_leu> Is BMCC issuing the EMT basic credentials as VCs?
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Are embedded in there as well um 
  so the collection of all of these uh credentials then helps to 
  build an ler that they can take into uh in this case the specific 
  industry but we do these for Industries all all types of 
  different Industries we also do the work with the employers uh to 
  understand what skills are needed and connect those to the skills 
  that are being taught explicitly in these learning programs.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So this is a a sample uh LR 
  infrastructure graphic that that Danielle actually put together 
  it helps to kind of create a better visual for the employers that 
  we're working with and the the education partners that we're 
  working with the idea of an ler is still uh many people get it 
  when it's all laid out but coming in cold to some of these 
  conversations it was really helpful to see a graphic about how 
  all these parts connect.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Who's attended I um ler 
  recommended practices working group over the last 4 years this is 
  sort of inspired by that um that model and the original kind of 
  trust triangle that was put out in in the early days of this work 
  but when we talk with our education Partners or providers here 
  they're the ones who are actually creating and managing a 
  collection of credentials and issuing them um and that education 
  provider can be a college it can be a training program you for us 
  we we've created durable skills that are being issued or by other 
  higher ed institutions or uh training partners.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: We want to help them see that when 
  they issue that credential it should actually be then stored in a 
  digital wallet and an individual should be able to take those 
  credentials and achievements to help build their profile and 
  their resume to share with employers whether that's directly with 
  employers through an applicant check checking system or uh human 
  resource information system or by diving into a talent 
  Marketplace which is a growing concept I think um across the 
  employment landscape.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Those employers receive that right 
  so this I think this group is very well-versed with all of this 
  uh the employers then want to verify that that credential is what 
  um it was issued to be and it has the the evidence and data 
  inside of it to be unpacked to verify that they have those skills 
  that they have um the sort of the skills to do the job that 
  they're being hired for.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  so this.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Credential registry or trust 
  registry uh we don't really get too much into that with the 
  education providers um.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Until we start building a strategy 
  and implementing that strategy in action but uh that can go a lot 
  of different ways as everyone here knows.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So this then tries to help connect 
  the job Seekers qualifications and what would appear in their 
  current resume or application and oar with the job posting that 
  the employers are doing and this is where we increasingly are 
  working with employers to make sure that the job postings they're 
  creating uh I use those skills language and skills uh terminology 
  to identify what it is they're actually looking for and connected 
  to the skills that individuals have um and have earned through 
  their their learning achievements.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So I'll stop there do some 
  resources that I think are helpful to at least keep track of some 
  major ler initiatives and work happening in the states um and 
  these all I can share this deck with everybody and all these are 
  linked to these initiatives um or tools but I'll I'll just give a 
  little pause and see if there's any questions or comments.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): So we have a question in chat from Sharon.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh with regards to the borrow Manhattan are 
  they issuing the Mt basic credentials as verifiable credentials.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Yes so that that's the big part of 
  of our work with them is that we do bring to to light the the 
  different types of credentials and standards that support them 
  and Danielle the tool that she's going to share is a great 
  comparison tool for our partners to see what issuers like what 
  what form they're actually issuing those credentials in I think 
  that's that's part of the challenge that we can make 
  recommendations about.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: What they should be looking for 
  asking for but the reality is many of them have um.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Credential issuing platforms that 
  they are signed on to that don't issue as VCS um and so that gets 
  uh a little messy but yes we we would always recommend that they 
  issue them as verifiable credentials.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh so in in that data structure so 
  that they can.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  be in.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Interoperable and individuals can 
  actually store them in compatible wallets.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Yeah so that the work of the the 
  mikrop pathways that we build uh end up becoming more of a 
  regional regionally focused efforts because we do the design 
  sessions with the higher education groups or the training 
  providers and we do them with the employers we have tools that 
  are surfacing those skills and then making that visible on both 
  sides right so when the employers go through the process and say 
  we have a tool called the T profile that helps to identify the 
  top 3 durable skills and then the top 3 technical or um industry 
  specific skills for that role as as named by employers we surface 
  those and they share those across um the design groups so that 
  the employers are seeing what higher ed prioritizes in their 
  programs and that employer or education provider see what the 
  employers are identifying in their programs or is or what they 
  need to be successful in those job roles.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Um so that that's part of that 
  process then when it actually comes to the.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> all of the components in the 
  pathways use CTDL and CTIDs for data about the pathway components 
  (credentials, courses, programs, competencies)
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Ing strategy and embedding that 
  skills data inside of the credentials that's where the 
  conversation moves with the education providers to say you know 
  how are you how are you going to do this what platform are you 
  going to use what tools are you going to use to actually make 
  that happen and I think I saw Deb Deb's name on here uh Deb 
  Everhart from credential engine credentials uh uh important.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh partner in that process for.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Storing skills data and uh using 
  structured language to make sure that that's represented inside 
  the credentials as well.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> not all of the colleges are 
  publishing their competencies in CTDL, but many are
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Yeah of course so.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh I'm going to fly through 
  experience you a little bit because this tool or this initiative 
  is doing some of the Lear work um at scale with uh some of the 
  partners that are doing things.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  sort of.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: At the systems level right so the 
  examples I just shared with education providers with employers 
  and some of the the regional work we're doing there this 
  initiative um is with the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation it's 
  still focused on Les but it's it's using AI to take uh existing 
  skills data whatever that may be from individuals and translating 
  that into credentials that would then be issued to those 
  individuals so you can imagine um as I go through here I'll just 
  share some of the partners uh some of the work in the projects 
  that they that they created so we are really built on this 
  premise that uh Les are.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Ible for most people so this 
  project really wanted to see how we might use AI to help make 
  lers at scale for people navigating their career and uh Economic 
  Opportunity.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So this this started last year was 
  Phase 1 these are all the uh groups that were participating in 
  this initiative um this was not something that was uh funding 
  each of these teams in their work it was more about finding 
  people who are doing this kind of work or want to engage in this 
  kind of work and um want to dedicate time and effort to sort of a 
  project Sprint to show proof of concept around technical 
  standards so this this 1 um was about building oars with 
  technical standards underneath them this was a very simple 
  graphic for how we went about that.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: But these were the Milestones the 
  technical Milestones that we were asking project teams to build 
  around and you could see uh the the structured Json LD formats of 
  obb 3 crb2 and and the verified credential data model 1.1 that 
  was the base so when when groups were coming to this work saying 
  how how do we structure it these are these are the the formats 
  that you should be working in and then issuing to individuals so 
  that their ler can be both human readable and machine readable.
<ildiko_mazar> @Phil Long, sorry I just noticed you were in the 
  queue. Can we get back to your question later?
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: The application of AI in this work 
  ended up kind of falling into sort of 3 buckets um credential 
  mapping uh scale and competency extraction and then AI agents as 
  assistant so 1 of the projects uh was working with incarcerated 
  people side uh of prisons in the states and they had built a very 
  simple chat agent where um because inmates aren't able to type 
  into keyboards they had to use a voice-based uh chat agent to 
  have an individual talk about some of the experiences they had 
  inside of prisons like if they were working in a kitchen or they 
  were cleaning for years they would share those experiences the 
  chat agent would kind of um respond to them and say hey it sounds 
  like you did these things and you you learned these skills is 
  that true or not and as they were validating uh those experiences 
  through this chat interface they would then create credentials on 
  the back end that that embedded that skills data inside of them 
  so that when they were released from prison.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  they could.
<pl/t3> @Ildiko - my comment was about your question which, I 
  think at this point  we've moved on from so I might jump in later 
  but it's not critical now.  Thanks for asking.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Digital wallet with credentials to 
  go then take to find opportunity um so that's an example of a of 
  an agent assistant that was uh used in this project.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: On all this work was really built 
  around these different personas so that this again goes back to 
  the human centered nature of of Education design Labs work is 
  we're really rallying around the individuals that are going 
  through this process and in this phase at least um for this work 
  groups work talking with and working with individuals and and 
  validating their tools with individuals that are getting ears 
  created for them so they're very much a human uh humans in the 
  design process and working with these teams to create and 
  validate the tools.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So here are some of the the key 
  takeaways I want to focus on the the interoperability of all this 
  work it is possible and I think that was uh you know the question 
  that shared was asking too is you know if you do all this work 
  and it's not in uh an interoperable data format then does it 
  really help them navigate a skills ecosystem or a larger uh 
  digital uh world and you know our our response to that would be 
  no it doesn't if you're issuing credentials but they don't have 
  any portability to them you can't store them in a wallet you 
  can't do anything with them outside of that narrow platform or 
  environment then it really doesn't help them um find new 
  opportunity and really doesn't help them uh even just understand 
  the skills that they have maybe.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh so this deck will get shared 
  these are some low earnings but we got into phase 2 now and 
  that's where I think Simone kind of nudged me to share with this 
  group is that we're expanding on what we learned in Phase 1 and 
  the proof of Concepts there to start doing a longer timeline 
  around field testing so we know that these tools exist we know 
  that groups are doing this work and we're trying to align with uh 
  projects that are using AI or or translating and or translating 
  past experiences into production formats to take with them and 
  again this is all being done uh as a project with the US Chamber 
  of Commerce Foundation under the T3 Innovation Network so that's 
  a a network that the the chamber is overseas um it's this 
  initiative specifically is funded by the bill and the Gates 
  Foundation um but it sits under the T3 Innovation Network and I 
  know Dmitri and others are involved in some of those other 
  working groups and other projects with the T3 Network as well um 
  with.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: The foundation of all of this 
  would be technical standards and in some cases building uh 
  standards to help um Advanced all this work.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So this is the guiding question 
  that we're using for Phase 2 is really we are looking to get 
  these into the hands of individuals at scale so that they can 
  navigate and help to build this this broader ecosystem I think 
  the scale part is really the focus of of phase 2 is that we've 
  seen some groups doing this work and now we'd really like to 
  highlight uh the scaling of their efforts and we we kicked off a 
  couple months ago and this will be running sort of in 2 uh Parts 
  uh 1 through the end of this year and then the second um being at 
  the beginning of next year.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: And we have some some guidelines 
  that we've created for this this work and I'll show that after 
  I'm not going to go through go too far into that now but um if 
  anyone has any questions about any of these I'll make sure that 
  my email address gets in the chat and I would love to chat more 
  about any of this Taylor Hansen is uh the partner at the US 
  chamber Foundation who is helping to lead this work so he and I 
  um work closely on this and many on the call I think are aware of 
  or have have been involved with some groups of participated in uh 
  Phase 1 and are uh participating in Phase 2 so here's the 
  timeline of that work as well.
<pl/t3> Hello everyone!
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: As I mentioned this wasn't a we 
  aren't funding project teams um it's really the a community of 
  practice that's being developed here because we are all kind of 
  navigating this world together um we see that as being a really 
  powerful part of this effort and we've heard that from 
  participants as well is that really being able to connect with 
  others who are doing this work and talk about some of the 
  challenges and successes they're having is really powerful um 
  Phil long is the lead technical uh advisor on this project and 
  was through Phase 1 as well um and through this effort there is 
  uh a real uh powerful opportunity to have this sort of discourse 
  out in the open and have a platform to elevate these 
  conversations uh with others oh I see Phil Phil is on here hey 
  Phil um so he can he can answer any questions about some of the 
  technical stuff and just this project um at large um the other uh 
  platform that we're using is the T3 meeting scheduled to have 
  some of these conversations so uh the T.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh trusted learner network 
  unconference was just in Phoenix about a month ago and there was 
  a T3 day where they updated on the T3 projects and we talked 
  about experience you and there was the announcement of the T3 
  International which uh includes Simone uh as sort of the 
  representative of some of that work so a lot of great things 
  happening in the T3 network uh in the states and really excited 
  that this project gets to be 1 of them.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So I'll pause there and see what 
  other questions we have and then I'll I'll turn it over to 
  Danielle and she she's going to talk more about a tool that she's 
  been the lead on that helps our partners navigate this whole kind 
  of wicked uh world of of credent and wallets and lurs um but yeah 
  any questions or comments people want to share.
PL/T3: On that yes can you hear me.
PL/T3: This good um yeah no the question actually back then was 
  with respect to how is the uh conversation about skills um 
  progressing to be able to identify them both from a from the 
  perspective of identify skills associated with a training um and 
  education that might be coming from formal entities like 
  community colleges and training companies and things as well as 
  internally professional development training that are going on 
  within businesses and mapping those to the to their expression in 
  skills-based credentials and um and the the.
<eric_shepherd> Experience You provided some great high-tech 
  solutions which was very impressive. Are you aware of anyone 
  using Technology to let people uploaded paper 
  qualifications/certificates to be recognized as an LER?
PL/T3: Comment there was really more than a question that um we 
  finally been able to get engaged with the the US Chamber of 
  Commerce is uh Talent pipeline program which brings in 
  individuals in uh mostly medium-sized businesses uh into an 
  academy kind of context to give them professional development 
  around um better practices for running their businesses and 1 of 
  the places that we're now being able to introduce that 
  conversation about skills development and how it's recognized so 
  that was a positive uh um uh advancement if you will of 
  Industries getting connected to this conversation where it's 
  already talked about a lot but doesn't necessarily get rendered 
  well in terms of um their uh effective utilization of it and uh 
  and and of course Danielle can talk more about the skills space 
  hiring and advancement work that she would.
PL/T3:  was leading at.
PL/T3: Um that led to a number of reports that hopefully she 
  could put in chat or something to give you some links to so that 
  was with that is with respect to the um AI Project work on 
  experience you um.
<danielle_saunders> Skills-based hiring report on employer and 
  job candidate use cases: 
  https://www.t3networkhub.org/resources/skills-based-hiring-project-report
PL/T3: Thing that we found that that um was jumped past to some 
  extent in terms of learning uh was that the use of the AI and the 
  like and the ability to integrate it into systems that generated 
  or extracted out skills and the like was relatively 
  straightforward relative to the unfamiliarity that most of the 
  developers and Technical people in the companies uh had with the 
  Json LD expression of this as a uh as a graph and as a 
  consequence um there was more discussion around how to go about 
  translating that information properly into a into a Json LD 
  formatted credential that was computational.
<danielle_saunders> and education provider use cases: 
  https://www.t3networkhub.org/resources/use-cases-for-enabling-the-future-of-skills-based-hiring
PL/T3: And I make 1 other comment which is 1 Project did extract 
  skills from uh courses in uh Case Western reserves uh programs at 
  uh University in the US.
PL/T3: Their mechanism for deriving skills achieve because they 
  only had inferential methods to do it was to look at the 
  recurrence of the statement of skills that were in syllabi about 
  what was supposed to be learned and when they occurred more than 
  3 or 5 3 to 5 times over the course of several semesters then 
  they inferred that there's a reasonable likelihood that that 
  skill might have been in fact learned and used that as their 
  criteria for being able to pull it into a credential which I 
  thought was an interesting workaround to that problem that's it 
  thanks.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: I don't see anyone but.
<eric_shepherd> TY
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Great and I'll I'll be able to 
  respond in the chat now to I'm gonna stop my screen share and 
  pass it over to Danielle um Danielle Saunders to talk about uh 
  all she's involved in so many things so I feel like limiting her 
  to just say she's gonna talk about this thing um is is not there 
  but she's been really helping us with uh creating a a credential 
  wallet comparison tool um and Phil mentioned uh some of the 
  skills based hiring stuff that she's been involved in with the T3 
  Network as well uh but she's been an awesome partner uh so I'll 
  stop screen share and hand it over to Danielle.
Danielle_Saunders: Thanks Colin and I wanted to make sure we uh 
  caught Eric's question I don't know if I saw the answer um.
Danielle_Saunders: Just wanted to make sure we raised it which 
  was about um calling if you are aware of anyone using technology 
  to let people upload paper qualifications to be recognized as 
  Kelly R.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Yeah so the the example project 
  that um Phil share was actually born from transcripts uh so I 
  guess in that term uh if if you use your PDF transcript for that 
  specific use case that's what it was mapping so it was it was 
  parsing out the information from the PDF and then mapping it to 
  um.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So those inferred skills from a a 
  language model that they had actually built on the open syllabus 
  project or built from the open syllabus project so they worked 
  with a couple other universities to build that language model and 
  then and then map again but the starting point was uh a PDF 
  transcript and some of the other projects um I think.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: You know these groups talk about 
  uploading PDFs in and then parsing them for key terms and then 
  potentially attaching skills data for those skilled terms um 
  there was a project or 2 that was that was doing something akin 
  to that.
Danielle_Saunders: It's it's so interesting I'm I'm glad you've 
  been talking about that today call and there's so many different 
  directions to take.
<eric_shepherd> I will also take my question offline
Danielle_Saunders: There's so much work that was done in such a 
  short amount of time um so I'm really glad um that you're able to 
  share.
Danielle_Saunders: More on that today um.
Danielle_Saunders: Yeah so thanks thanks for the intro the warm 
  intro Colin I'm a consultant in skills-based Workforce 
  Development work with um Colin and Naomi on what I'm gonna share 
  with you today at the lab and also uh the chamber working with 
  Phil Long Phil Barker Eric Shepard Demitri who are all here today 
  hello.
<eric_shepherd> :)
Danielle_Saunders: Wanted to uh give you an overview on this 
  wallet comparison tool.
Danielle_Saunders: Which we've been creating for uh higher ed 
  Partners we're working with at the lab.
Danielle_Saunders:  to help.
Danielle_Saunders: Them answer questions around what.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> creynolds@eddesignlab.org for 
  anyone that wants to connect on these projects and more
Danielle_Saunders: Is available in the market for purchase to 
  help us um.
Danielle_Saunders: Communicate what our Learners can do and so 
  there that's it's a multi-part solution infrastructure that is 
  needed which includes issuing platforms wallets of course um 
  Registries which Colin mentioned so it's a complex thing to 
  explain to folks um but lately we've been finding that um getting 
  down to the actual products that are available themselves helps 
  make this more concrete conversation.
Danielle_Saunders: And so um we have a set of uh wallets that 
  we've looked at and kind of cross-checked across a set of 
  principles that are intended to support skills-based hiring 
  interoperability usability and accessibility so that uh people 
  can get an idea of a little bit where the market is.
Danielle_Saunders: Uh so I'm going to share that.
<pl/t3> @Eric The incarcerated people project led by WorkBay used 
  input from both text and audio files to apply AI to for the 
  purposes of extracting skills from those verbal or written 
  descriptions of things they have learned to do.
Danielle_Saunders: In the chat and while I do that uh Colin.
Danielle_Saunders: Uh do you want me to go to the hour or break 
  before the hour for any more business in this meeting.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh you can take it all the way all 
  the way up to the hour I think with with Q&A too as long as as 
  that sound good ittico.
Danielle_Saunders: And Demetri are you in the queue.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17MNwYOTN1iGQRI9rKy9DV-2DjMee-NMpTh-DjNbdOt8/edit#heading=h.7x6z1z25dddj
<danielle_saunders> Here is the wallet solutions comparison
Danielle_Saunders: No worries I'm just sharing my.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.):  was was trying.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Uh find that mute button sorry about that uh.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Yes I had a quick question about 1 of the 
  early slides uh Colin where he showed you mapped uh a number of 
  uh fundamental skills or something like that and I was wondering 
  uh is.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Is that available on the net it was definitely 
  something we would love to take a look at.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Always looking for skills schemas and 
  credential schemas.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Yeah I'll I'll share the whole 
  deck here um and if there are other if there are specific slides 
  or um.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Docs that you want a closer look 
  at I could probably share those with you directly I'm not sure 
  that all of this is available on our website um but there are 
  some samples there and I'd be happy to share more.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): Awesome thank you.
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> My deck: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pD9ri-8acvzCPm_KkiEixIHrbdbCjASQE0HcwFqFMKQ/edit#slide=id.g27017769906_0_2264
Danielle_Saunders: So I see people jumping in the dock thank you.
Danielle_Saunders: This is a live document uh we are continually 
  adding updates as things uh change with these products everything 
  is uh going pretty pretty fast so um again as an overview.
Danielle_Saunders: We wanted to support.
<dmitri_z._(pres.)> @Colin - it's showing as access denied for me
Danielle_Saunders: Skills-based hiring in the mobility of Records 
  so we were inspired by um jmf and Sharon lose a wallet Market 
  scan we came out in 2022 and we are.
Danielle_Saunders: Um fully supporting the use of.
Danielle_Saunders:  the verify.
Danielle_Saunders: Standard so this is part of what we consider 
  essential interoperability.
Danielle_Saunders: Uh and we all kind of skip down real quick to 
  to to these principles we looked at a few categories of things 
  that um a wallet probably should do.
Danielle_Saunders: With a baseline description of a wallet is 
  something that allows you to.
Danielle_Saunders: Store curate and share your records from it 
  and I want to get I want to spend a bit of time uh with you all 
  on that I actually love to have a discussion uh about uh 
  clarifying exactly how we Define a wallet.
Danielle_Saunders: Add a couple of levels um but but in this 
  first past what we came up with are a set uh this was all 
  inspired by um the dcc's work uh in in in their um.
Danielle_Saunders: Uh creation of a list of requirements um for 
  wallets and other sources we also Drew on um to to help uh start 
  to create this kind of lightweight path here uh in which we're 
  looking at um some basic adherence to um guidelines for 
  accessibility but also uh not you know having too much jargon um 
  looking at uh extra things that will help support Equity um and 
  then it just overall usability um kind of using the principle 
  here of if 1 critical uh step is broken that a user needs to 
  complete then it's really not usable um so any any major breakage 
  or anything that's just too difficult um is not very much a 
  usable product for the broad audience that we are looking at uh 
  should be um able to use wallets.
Danielle_Saunders: And then skills-based hiring and advancement 
  this gets into a lot of the fun um intriguing questions unfolding 
  and how we capture and display skills data but at a minimum we 
  want this to be able to um show what skills data is uh contained 
  in records um kind of unpack that a little bit facilitate it in 
  some way if it does more that's even better um and we also expect 
  that uh someone should be able to receive credentials and then 
  curate a set of them.
Danielle_Saunders: A bundle or whatever we want to call it a 
  verifiable pre presentation um and be able to share that and I 
  understand those are different things but they're different 
  options uh be able to share that out to um recipient like an 
  employer.
Danielle_Saunders: Um interoperability uh we wanted to make sure 
  that the wallet allows uh the credentials to most importantly be 
  imported and exported out uh in in kind of a a native format 
  encoding so that there's no loss of data um as it comes in and 
  leaves um so ideally it would be supporting anything that's a 
  verifiable credential uh open badge version 3 crb2 um you know 
  this is what we'd really like to see.
Danielle_Saunders: Um and then of course these uh great um uh 
  privacy and and control features for the the user which put the 
  user really in charge of receiving and sharing um.
Danielle_Saunders: Their records of course self assertions are an 
  important part of this work uh to be able to include things that 
  may not have been received by the learner as a credential but 
  which are important for them to communicate and include in a 
  bundle um and then of course uh verification should be supported 
  which should also include subject verification so this would help 
  you receive uh if you know if you're uh receiving a credential 
  then it should be checked to see if that credential belongs to 
  you.
Danielle_Saunders: And so um there's additional features here 
  which just make things even more exciting and uh um had 
  functionality for the learner to be able to um use their records 
  in new ways use them in a talent Marketplace um there's more here 
  and hopefully as time goes on things in the bonus section will 
  come up into these other sections um as as things that we expect 
  and so I'll scroll up here.
Danielle_Saunders:  and you'll.
Danielle_Saunders: See we've got.
Danielle_Saunders: Got a set of vendors at the top here their 
  product name in teal along this line uh just an overall statement 
  about the wallet and the it's how it uh kind of aligns or does 
  not align to the principles here uh basically how the business 
  model operates who who is being charged um whether it's in 
  production or in development or in Pilot and then a rough 
  assessment of how it meets these criteria uh under the 
  interoperability 1 we look at uh which standards and protocols 
  it's uh using or says it's using.
Danielle_Saunders: Any bonus features and whether we uh did 
  actually were able to look at the wallet.
Danielle_Saunders: And and play around with it.
Danielle_Saunders: Um and it Scrolls to the left so you can 
  scroll or sorry to the right and see more uh wallets and I'll 
  note that not every wallet that you may expect to be on here is 
  on here yet and that gets into the discussion that I'm hoping to 
  have with you all um in the next 10 or so minutes which is.
Danielle_Saunders: The way we're defining wallet.
Danielle_Saunders: And again that minimum definition was around 
  it being able to store share um you kind of store curate and 
  share records uh but when you really get into the specifics I 
  think there are some some cutoff points like ideally it can do 
  all those record types perhaps more but what should it do at 
  minimum right now to be called a wallet.
Danielle_Saunders: Then what would indicate that it's not a 
  wallet that it's significantly below the kind of functionality 
  that we would expect from a wallet to be considered not a wallet 
  because there's such a spectrum.
Danielle_Saunders: Of what is implemented and ready to go now and 
  there's.
Danielle_Saunders: Progress in full implementation of wallet 
  features then would make it easy to say okay these are wallets 
  these are on these are not wallets these are not on it's really 
  quite complicated so um I think this group is fantastic for being 
  able to to discuss this.
Danielle_Saunders: So that's the question I'd love to pose to you 
  all.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): No I think I asked my question before so I'll 
  go ahead.
<pl/t3> @Ildiko what is partial sharing mean to you?
<dmitri_z._(pres.)> I think Ildiko is talking about Selective 
  Disclosure
Danielle_Saunders: Thanks for your questions.
<pl/t3> That's what I'm inferring but ..?
Danielle_Saunders: I'll I'll do them in order so yes Demetri just 
  said partial sharing that makes me think of selective and 
  Progressive disclosure.
Danielle_Saunders: If does that sound right to you where someone 
  is able to either uh uh share only a partial uh part of their 
  record with a relying party or uh share it uh some first and then 
  as a later stage happens more of the record or all of the records 
  later.
Dmitri_Z._(pres.): I think it'll be I think that's a question for 
  you is that what you meant.
Danielle_Saunders: Yeah that's a question for you does that sound 
  like what you're asking about.
Danielle_Saunders: Yes so short answer yes absolutely that would 
  be fantastic we want to see while to be able to support that that 
  would be sharing in part or potentially as a as a derivation also 
  gets into where you might be able to share a computation from 
  your records but not the actual uh data itself for example age as 
  the as the computed like a binary on did you have the right age.
Danielle_Saunders: Um for something.
Danielle_Saunders: Yes I think that would be ideal um.
Danielle_Saunders: Not necessarily a ton of implementation 
  available yet uh we'd love to see more so and the second Point 
  too um on holder can decline that was a really interesting 1 um.
Danielle_Saunders: I think again it's it's all a great discussion 
  but uh if.
Danielle_Saunders: Anyone has really strong opinions about that 
  it would be great to to hear more from you um it seemed like a 
  good uh feature but again you know if you decline to accept it in 
  the wallet then it may expire uh not sorry let me not use that 
  word the issuer May no longer be offering it at a certain time so 
  you may not have access to it right there's lots of interesting 
  implications you don't have to share it even if you do accept it 
  uh love to have a longer conversation on that.
<ildiko_mazar> I suppose the crux of the matter here is that not 
  all credentials are equal.
PL/T3: I jumped in the queue I don't know if anybody else is on 
  there.
Danielle_Saunders: I think I see Susan might be 1 spot before 
  you.
Susan_Stroud: Thank you um I'm Susan stra from Life equipped and 
  I have 2 quick questions hopefully 1 is maybe a comment around um 
  Linux open Wallet foundation and the work that they're doing to 
  create a wallet registry there's a lot of um overlap in terms of 
  some of the things that they're looking for there's some things 
  you guys are looking for that they're not um and there might be a 
  deeper level of review that they're planning to approach so might 
  be interesting to you know understand what synergies may exist 
  there and.
Susan_Stroud:  um what.
Susan_Stroud: Of the things.
Susan_Stroud: That you know is confusing to me is like how you 
  get onto this form what the eligibility intake you know 
  onboarding looks like for the wallets that may want to get onto 
  your list here as compared to you know the process with let's say 
  open Wallet Foundation which is.
Susan_Stroud: Open for anyone to have their wallet assessed so 
  just wanted to.
Susan_Stroud: Understand that process a little bit more and how 
  that collaboration may be coming along.
Danielle_Saunders: I think that would be a great conversation 
  love uh love it if you point me to um who we could talk to on 
  that um if that's you or someone else um love to talk about any 
  uh uh collaboration or or work that we can share um in terms of 
  the process for uh getting onto this list it's really just 
  reaching out.
<pl/t3> I have the email of the some of the OWF team
Danielle_Saunders: To us and there's a form you can uh submit um 
  and and we just work 1-on-1 with the vendors and have an ongoing 
  conversation um it's very much a a back and forth um where we 
  want to.
Danielle_Saunders: Um make it as as collaborative as possible 
  with everyone.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: And I'll add to that uh I sort of 
  have an eye on at least subscribe to the open wall foundations 
  um.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: What sort of essentially and.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Context for the 1 that Danielle 
  and I'm talking about here is for us-based higher education uh 
  providers specifically so I think that's the context at least 
  from which this 1 should be viewed is that the the realities 
  around their Learning Management systems or student information 
  systems and things that are already happening on campus sort of 
  Drive their ability to even think about approaching a wallet many 
  of them feel responsibility to make a wallet recommendation or 
  provide a wallet for their students as opposed to uh the idea 
  that their students would have their own wallet that they're then 
  bringing to the university or education provider so I think that 
  I that context might be helpful at least in determining how this 
  Tool uh supports specific Partners versus like how you mentioned 
  the overall Foundation I think has more of a a Global Perspective 
  and really like a universal adoption and Universal implement.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: To it but like Danielle said there 
  anyone can reach out to us and we'd be happy to have the 
  conversation and add them to the list uh as appropriate and there 
  should be in that that doc um a link yeah I think Daniel 
  highlighted it right there to to complete the form and get that 
  process going with us.
PL/T3: Yeah just a quick comment um the the notion of um 
  receiving the ability of an individual to decline for example a 
  transcript or something or a degree uh assertion from their 
  institution uh at least in the US uh the the student or the 
  learner does not have to accept that that doesn't mean that that 
  the institution hasn't done the work necessary and evaluated that 
  person's uh contributions in their courses in the light to make 
  their award but the but the student um now graduate does not have 
  to accept that if they don't want to.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> thanks all!
PL/T3: And uh and that leads to the second comment with respect 
  to selective disclosure it's very new to most of the folks out 
  there I think and um we've had conversations with Acro which is 
  the registrar and admissions officers associations in the us um 
  about uh signing individual class uh um uh classes that are in or 
  courses that are in a transcript as opposed to signing the 
  overall transcript document um such that an individual might 
  therefore be able to selectively pull out verifiable course uh uh 
  information from a transcript and use that in a verifiable 
  presentation sent to an employer but with the concepts that we 
  would like to ensure that the individuals receiving it know this 
  is a partial representation of that individual's overall 
  transcript and I'll stop there thank you.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Yeah I just want to Echo the 
  thanks to everyone here I mean we I feel like we are even able to 
  have this conversation because of all of the years of of work 
  that this group has done and um all the reports and and projects 
  that have been put out there were really want this to be additive 
  and we're really trying to support education and employer 
  partners that are hearing about ler's hearing about wallets 
  trying to make decisions about systems and tools to to implement 
  so uh appreciate the time to to present some of our work happy to 
  talk about it more with anyone here but just want to say thank 
  you to everyone here for helping uh Advance this work and and 
  bring these conversations together.
Danielle_Saunders: That's a fabulous call out Colin and uh we I 
  know we would love to continue this conversation so um please do 
  reach out I'll put my email in the chat here.
Danielle_Saunders: And Phil yeah.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Phil was added to the Q2.
<danielle_saunders> dmariesaunders@gmail.com
PL/T3: That was an attempt to do a a clap thank you and it 
  clicked in the wrong spot.
Danielle_Saunders: We'll take it thank you all.
Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Awesome thank you.
