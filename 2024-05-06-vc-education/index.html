<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: All right so so we are a national nonprofit based in the United States uh the home base was Washington DC prior to the pandemic and and then the lab became uh a remote company or remote group that works with colleges universities in other organizations including employers and increasingly more work with employers uh around um designing testing and building new models and approaches to solving challenges for uh individuals that need them most we usually talk about uh the new majority Workforce which are typically um. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: First generation college students uh or non non-degree college students but we work alongside very closely with community colleges uh increasingly more estate education groups uh State Workforce boards uh and other organizations to help really kind of build ecosystems of solutions. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So we a lot of the work is done designing uh micro Pathways with post-secondary groups again currently our work is mostly based in the US we have been increasingly learning from many that are on the call here and a lot of the modeling what uh been going on in Europe with the Euro pass and a lot of the other projects um specifically in the way that that the standards are being uh incorporated into Solutions so some of the work we&apos;re going to talk about uh explicitly States uh some of the technical standards that we are hoping our partners are are checking for or or requesting as they&apos;re looking at credent in and using data to help support their Learners and employers import uh supporting their earners. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh so we&apos;ll talk a little bit about some of the how we approach this work with higher education Partners we talk about a digital discoverability strategy um that includes learning an employment records uh other forms of verified credentials um we we also do some work with employers under what&apos;s becoming more talked about in the states as skills first to work or skills-based hiring in advancements skills are really becoming uh a very uh common topic for policy makers state boards State education boards um and groups working to try to find ways to get people into jobs without having the 4 year to degree requirement or 2 year degree requirement be the standard so they talk a lot about that work is skills based and skills first and and then I&apos;ll share a little bit about a project that we are leading with the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation uh called experience you. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: How we can we can chat a little bit about some of those projects and then want to hand it over to Danielle to talk about the tool that we uh are using most actively to support our higher education Partners in navigating this whole world. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So I threw on the Lear slide I think many here know what a knower is but when we work with our partners we end up finding ourselves in the place of of educating them on uh just what an ler is exactly and what it isn&apos;t and how they can think about it inside of a bigger strategy but the the idea of an ler being an employment record is uh increasingly um common in the approach uh to our work and and our partners often come to us and ask for support in building an ler or you know what is and what is in an oer so we really talk about it as a a collection of of All Digital records uh and and the experience you project that I&apos;ll share a little bit more about is taking past uh experiences employment and learning and helping to credential them in a way that would allow individuals to bring their past experiences forward into this digital realm because a lot of the work that happens is uh focused on current uh issuance of credentials and and moving forward. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  uh not many organizations. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Ations think about how. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Issue for past experiences to include those in into a learning and employment record. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;laura_paglione&gt; Will you be sharing the slides or the links that are on the slides?</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So in in the work that we do I mentioned it it being more about digital discoverability and a strategy we we keep the humans at the center of all the work that we do so at Design Lab really focuses on human centered and Equity centered design we have a lot of tools and processes for centering the the problem statements and solutions statements with those individuals in in mind so we we&apos;ve done a a we&apos;ve done a ton of work across a variety of states in the US um but the common theme Here is that the humans are the focus uh so when we think about a skills-based ecosystem we look at micro credentials and credentials digital badges whatever you want to call them they all have sort of different nuances to them but Micro credentials sit at the core of of the L which should be stored inside a digital wallet where an individual has some ownership and ability to Port those credentials to places that are going to help find help them find Value and opportunity in a skills based ecosystem but it&apos;s it&apos;s incredibly important. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  in our work. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Center that with the humans that are being impacted by it so it involves a lot of design sessions with employers with higher education partners with Learners with earners and um a combination of all of them together. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So with micro credentials in mind the lab created a set of durable skills micro credentials um that have competencies these are the the 9 main competencies there are sub competencies associated with them and this set of durable skills we also developed a set of learning uh modules and assessments that help to uh basically credential existing experience for individuals so the the tools called X credit uh the X credit assessments that&apos;s a whole separate presentation that this group may be interested in uh but the xcredit really helps our partners think about ways that they can uh validate uh these skills and competencies in the context of whatever industry they&apos;re working in and so there&apos;s a lot of different applications for it in the assessments that have been created are are very rigorous assessments at a research base uh they&apos;re they&apos;re scenario based so you can imagine an individual going through sort of a a mock problem solution. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Dialogue with another human in a virtual setting uh if you could go as far as you know putting it into a VR Set uh to engage in that as well but that um. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: This is a way that we work with our partners to help talk about and sort of calibrate around what we mean when we say durable skills or soft skills and uh how we can teach those skills explicitly and assess them and award credentials to represent those competencies. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So this I I know is a probably a little overwhelming of a visual but when we talk with our higher education Partners or increasingly more with employers about what we mean when we say digital discoverability and skills visibility what we&apos;re really trying to do is help identify skills that individuals are learning in specific contexts and how we can make those skills visible inside of the larger ecosystem for employers to find and for individuals to be able to see I think that&apos;s been a a real uh powerful part of the work that we do with with Partners is that. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Go through these process are they collect credentials they get a better sense of the skills that they actually have which helps them navigate their conversations and interview processes and application processes for new jobs but when we work with Partners we we start talking about the skills and we want to make sure that we have identified the skills that are happening and align those uh skills to the learning experiences that are going on whether it&apos;s on campus or in a work-based uh learning environment internships apprenticeships what have you or combination of all those things so in order to make those skills visible we need to use well in this case credentials and verified credentials help to document those and attach assessment uh attach evidence so that when they take them in their l in their wallet to a Marketplace they&apos;re able to bring those to the surface. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Uh so this is an example of what 1 of those micro Pathways might look like um so this was uh created with the burrow of Manhattan Community College uh we do this work with I think we&apos;re actively working with uh about 40 community colleges across the country um again mostly focused around Stars which are those who are skilled through alternative routes so many of these are non-degree programs often non-credit programs as well that are focused on industry certifications High need or in need job positions um inside of specific regions in States so we work with the the both ends of the spectrum so the employers that would be hiring these individuals and the colleges and education institutions which is increasingly moving into high school for some of the dual enrollment programs um as well we run through design sessions to help identify the experiences that individuals need to have you can see the 21st uh. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab:  Century or Dior. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Are embedded in there as well um so the collection of all of these uh credentials then helps to build an ler that they can take into uh in this case the specific industry but we do these for Industries all all types of different Industries we also do the work with the employers uh to understand what skills are needed and connect those to the skills that are being taught explicitly in these learning programs. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So this is a a sample uh LR infrastructure graphic that that Danielle actually put together it helps to kind of create a better visual for the employers that we&apos;re working with and the the education partners that we&apos;re working with the idea of an ler is still uh many people get it when it&apos;s all laid out but coming in cold to some of these conversations it was really helpful to see a graphic about how all these parts connect. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Who&apos;s attended I um ler recommended practices working group over the last 4 years this is sort of inspired by that um that model and the original kind of trust triangle that was put out in in the early days of this work but when we talk with our education Partners or providers here they&apos;re the ones who are actually creating and managing a collection of credentials and issuing them um and that education provider can be a college it can be a training program you for us we we&apos;ve created durable skills that are being issued or by other higher ed institutions or uh training partners. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: We want to help them see that when they issue that credential it should actually be then stored in a digital wallet and an individual should be able to take those credentials and achievements to help build their profile and their resume to share with employers whether that&apos;s directly with employers through an applicant check checking system or uh human resource information system or by diving into a talent Marketplace which is a growing concept I think um across the employment landscape. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: Those employers receive that right so this I think this group is very well-versed with all of this uh the employers then want to verify that that credential is what um it was issued to be and it has the the evidence and data inside of it to be unpacked to verify that they have those skills that they have um the sort of the skills to do the job that they&apos;re being hired for. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="information">Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab: So this then tries to help connect the job Seekers qualifications and what would appear in their current resume or application and oar with the job posting that the employers are doing and this is where we increasingly are working with employers to make sure that the job postings they&apos;re creating uh I use those skills language and skills uh terminology to identify what it is they&apos;re actually looking for and connected to the skills that individuals have um and have earned through their their learning achievements. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
