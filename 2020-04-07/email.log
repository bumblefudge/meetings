Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Did resolution calls on thursday - ongoing 
  for a while 1-2 pacific. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kaliya Young: Balazs_Nemethi: responding with the community 
  response to COVID19 work items may be surfacing that address IPR 
  - no clear path on how that can resolve. Delivering a work item 
  that should have iPR but doesn't could be very discouraging even 
  if made with good will. Wanted
Orie Steele: +1 Lets make sure we don't build schemas that people 
  are afraid to use...
Kaliya Young: The word IPR means many different things
Nate Otto:  He was asking about what type of IPR issues are 
  seeking to address. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Nate Otto:  Get release of anyones patents so that issues in the 
  future is addressed [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Orie Steele:  +1 To what Balazs said everyone wants to contribute 
  [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Orie Steele:  We want Medical experts to be involved. [scribe 
  assist by Kaliya Young]
Orie Steele:  We didn't think about the IpR and rights management 
  and then it gets adopted and nuked by a bunch of trolls. IPR 
  stuff sucks the joy out of everything it touches we should be 
  secure that we are not going to get impacted by patent trolls we 
  should have confidence that someone is going [scribe assist by 
  Kaliya Young]
Orie Steele:  Would like to a quick and easy way to protect the 
  community work but have fear that it an unsolved issues [scribe 
  assist by Kaliya Young]
Orie Steele: To be clear, my recommendation to DIF was to work 
  with the CCG, and use it and not the DIF for this protection.
Christopher Allen:  Similar concerns monitoring a number of 
  different projects.  a lot of the companies that are involved 
  have a history of patents and other things. I have become 
  increasingly aware of some land mines in the location area. I do 
  think the W3C should be in a good spot to create a venue that has 
  an IPR protections that are required. Concern the cat is out of 
  the bag. Anti-patents that address the issue. [scribe assist by 
  Kaliya Young]
Christopher Allen:  Should this be addressed here or in some 
  other group in the W3C it is easy to get our deliberations under 
  IPR. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Christopher Allen: +1 Wayne on broader participation
Wayne Vaughn:  Chiming in from the DIF perspective - one of the 
  most important things to me get people in the field involved in 
  the field involved with these processes. Critical to have 
  participation of those in the field directly. Difficult for HNS 
  HHS or .... consolidate the discussion. [scribe assist by Kaliya 
  Young]
Wayne Vaughn:  We need to support those from outside our 
  community to be able to interact with us as technologists. 
  [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Some conversations in DIF happening around 
  this. Two paths to consider - continuing over an e-mail 
  discussion. What is the lightest way forward. CCG or DIF seem 
  easiest. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Orie Steele: Proposal to use: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples, have conversations in a 
  number of places...
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Proposed way forward Balazs and Wayne talk 
  about it. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Balazs@identity.foundation - write me on covid IPR

  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/75
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  They were making real progress but then 
  stalled. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We were hoping to refer to that - we are 
  doing registries crypto suite registries. In beginning of thread 
  - light weight meta registries process. Proposal is to use that 
  as a starting point for how we maintain registries and we will 
  get to that later in the call. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  All we need is for the people who are leads 
  of registries - it seems accurate. [scribe assist by Kaliya 
  Young]

Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Last action item is a proposed code 
  repository [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]

  signatures but it uses standard JOSE libraries - it came up in 
  the verifiable credentials and JOSE signing libraries. [scribe 
  assist by Kaliya Young]
Orie Steele: Some support in did core: 
  https://w3c.github.io/did-core-registries/#jwsverificationkey2020
Orie Steele: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry/#jws
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  What ORIE proposed was the best solution - 
  we propose to bring it into ongoing work items - they are not 
  going to turn into a specification. [scribe assist by Kaliya 
  Young]
Orie Steele:  Key representation is the most valuable part of if. 
  [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]

  [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Took the charter and simplified and 
  modernized. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]

  out the CCG work item process that is a separate document - first 
  paragraph hasn't changed. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  You can make changes in suggestion 
  mode/track changes feel free to add those in [scribe assist by 
  Kaliya Young]

  https://identiverse.com
Joe Andrieu:  Public vote has to be called in two weeks - lasts 
  for two weeks 2/3 is required to past.  Process is now more 
  streamlined. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Joe Andrieu: https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/charter/
Christopher Allen:  I wanted to the document had a long laborious 
  thing about consent...loosely connected to amendments to charter 
  - the reality is that if the community wants to move forward or 
  change to the amendment and there is no principled objection it 
  should be easy to do. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Christopher Allen:  This replaces the harder process... that we 
  had. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  We have been thinking about changing the 
  process [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]

  diagrams to clarify the process. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kaliya Young: I like the diagrams :)
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Key internal workings is around work items 
  and how they happen. We try to shield people from the W3C 
  processes that are sort of the way things need to be. How do we 
  shield people from all this process. new GitHub template that 
  asks for information. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  If you don't like GitHub then reach out to 
  chairs. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]

  understanding more in-depth. it is meant to facilitate the 
  movement of work items through the standardized process. Ongoing 
  community draft. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]

  that it will apply [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Christopher Allen:  These ongoing things never become final 
  reports. we hope that some will become official draft. [scribe 
  assist by Kaliya Young]
Christopher Allen:  The registry requirements have not been 
  defined by the W3C - we are hoping it makes it easy to respond to 
  their changes. They may say that we have to add something to the 
  registries process. [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  What are our goals with this. we need to 
  (sorry was sneezing) [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]
