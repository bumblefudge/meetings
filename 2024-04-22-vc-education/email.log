<ildiko_mazar_(ntt_data)> Hello everyone, welcome to today's 
  Verifiable Credentials for Education task force call. Let's start 
  with the usual IP Note: Anyone can participate in these calls. 
  However, all substantive contributors to any CCG Work Items must 
  be members of the CCG with full IPR agreements signed. Please 
  note that these meetings are recorded. We have a robot 
  transcriber and we also do an audio and a video recording. If you 
  want to speak, please raise your hand, or type ‚Äúq+‚Äù in the chat 
  to add yourself to the queue.
<ildiko_mazar_(ntt_data)> If we have any new people in the call, 
  or somebody who would like to reintroduce themselves, please feel 
  free to take the floor. If nobody wants to take the floor, we can 
  move on to the main agenda topic, that are reflections from the 
  2024 Trusted Learner Network Unconference and the Internet 
  identity workshop.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
<simone_ravaioli> I have tried
<simone_ravaioli> restart
<dmitri_zagidulin> i'll say a few words on trust registries etc
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> thanks for the insights 
  Simone!
<ildiko_mazar_(ntt_data)> @Simone, can you elaborate on the 
  academics' feedback?
<ildiko_mazar_(ntt_data)> Were they appreciating the MC schema 
  mapping or rather suspicious.
<ildiko_mazar_(ntt_data)> Good question about _whether_ we really 
  need the trusted issuer list. In Europe we solve that Gordian 
  knot by requiring an advanced or qualified electronic seal from 
  the issuer, that contains information about the organisation's 
  legal registration.
<sharon_leu> @Ildiko, that is fine for official "institutions" 
  but probably would need explainers for issuers who are not.
<sharon_leu> Kim was THE OG!
<simone_ravaioli> Founding Co-Chair
<simone_ravaioli> I ran across a great IIW recap on LinkedIn, 
  calling out the various threads of Trust Registries in bullets... 
  anyone found it ?
<dmitri_zagidulin> haha thanks Colin, I was totally focusing just 
  on the technical side. (need more coffee :) )
<laura_paglione> Quick reminder that IIW always publishes their 
  proceedings. They are not yet published for the most recent 
  workshop, but all of them can be found here: 
  https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/
<sharon_leu> YAY Interoperability!
<ildiko_mazar_(ntt_data)> @Sharon, indeed by applying the eSeal 
  requirement, the EU restricts who can formally issue a credential 
  - the Issuer here would always have to be a legally registered 
  organisation, however we allow Awarding bodies to be any entity, 
  they just need to mandate a legally registered Agent to seal and 
  issue the credentials on the Awarding body's behalf.
<dmitri_zagidulin> hahahah baby steps, right -- holder identity 
  is really hard! :)
<dmitri_zagidulin> oooh, +1 Nate, more credentials need to be 
  issued at conferences etc!
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> GDN Annual Meeting: 
  https://groningendeclaration.org/gdn-am-2024/
<colin_reynolds,_ed_design_lab> Recap of the T3 Spring Meeting 
  from ASU/TLN: 
  https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/workforce/t3-network-spring-meeting-sets-the-stage-for-more-innovation
<nate_otto> Also this fall in Paris November 6-8 is the 
  open-recognition-focused ePIC Conference 
  https://epic.openrecognition.org/ Call for proposals now open.
<eric_shepherd> I found this interesting from Google Wallet 
  holding driving licenses in Colorado: 
<simone_ravaioli> This is a recap of IIW36 by TOIP - 
  https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/04/28/internet-identity-workshop-36-in-review/
<simone_ravaioli> I realized that recap is from last year - a 
  testimony that Registries have been hot for a while.
<dmitri_zagidulin> yeah! looking forward to the notes from that 
  being published!
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks!
<sharon_leu> @Simone - I wonder what time has taught us about 
  which of those still exists and would win if there were a rematch 
  today.
<kaliya_identity_woman> I also think that the real work on real 
  trust registries and more importantly directories of trust 
  registires - Lucy Yan has done was not as well seen.
<kerri_lemoie> Once we get rolling, we can present to the 
  community and then do updates as we go.
<sharon_leu> What kind of research?
<kerri_lemoie> @Kaliya - will follow up with you & Lucy
