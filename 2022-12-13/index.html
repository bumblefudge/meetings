<div onmouseout="$('#link-129').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-129').show()" id="129" class="comment"><span class="name">David Chadwick</span>:  Yes thank you. Yeah, the work we&#8217;ve been doing in the last 6 months or slightly longer is working with Fraunhofer in Germany. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Fraunhofer had an ESSIF project called Train a couple of years ago and we also had an ESSIF lab project at the same time and we worked with them to integrate Train into verifiable credentials to say how you could trust the issuer by putting a terms of use field into credentials and that allowed the issuer to say I&#8217;m a member of this trust federation and then the verifier could verify by contacting the trust federation to see if the issuer was trusted. And that was great, that was done. And then after the ESSIF project finished, we also showed how we could trust the schema that the issuer&#8217;s using and get the schema back from the trust framework to make sure that the credentials were properly issued and were well formed. And then in the last 6 months, we&#8217;ve added to Train trust in the verifier. So you might.. So why do you need trust in the verifier? Well, the analogy will be a user is on his web browser and he goes to a webpage and that webpage might be a scammer or whatever and it might be a sheep in wolf&#8217;s clothing and TLS is introduced to ensure that the user is definitely connecting to the website and the DSS owner through what&#8217;s called DV public certificate. So the analogy in the verifiable credentials case is that the user goes to some reliant party&#8217;s &#8230; verifier who says I would like to see your personal information in the shape of verifiable credentials and the user needs to be told whether this reliant party &#8230; verifier is actually trustworthy or not on his part of trust framework or if there&#8217;s some unknown entity that might abuse your personal information that you give to them. And so, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been working on building that into our wallet and into the Open ID for verifiable credentials &#8230; protocol. <a id="link-129" style="display:none;" href="#129">✪</a></div>
