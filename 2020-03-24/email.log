Joe Andrieu: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/108
Joe Andrieu:   I think we have processed this.  I want someone 
  with more github that can take a look?

Topic: Action Items

Manu Sporny:  This is still a CCG work item?  I don't know that 
  we have to do a FFA... then the chairs need to acknowledge it as 
  a document in WG
Dan Burnett:   We did this at F2F.
Manu Sporny:   Note it, redirect it then archive.
Joe Andrieu:  I believe we have done all that.
Joe Andrieu:  Not sure you mean by redirect?
Manu Sporny: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-use-cases/
Manu Sporny:   It is done, one second.  the only thing not done, 
  we need to update the spec and description. whoops. that's the 
  right link.  it should point to the new spec.
  ... with a new redirect to the new spec.  should take 10 
  minutes,  unarchive, link then re-archive
Joe Andrieu:  One, update URL at top, two add meta redirect to 
  the CCG use-case to DID WG use case document
Joe Andrieu:  ... In the backend it gets updated to the new one.
Joe Andrieu:   I will work on it.
Joe Andrieu: Github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/105
Orie Steele: The following repos will be orhpaned: 
  https://github.com/w3c-dvcg
Joe Andrieu:   Third issue.  closing digital verification comm 
  group. but we will have some orphaned issues.  Dimitry you got 
  assigned.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   I think we migrated?
Joe Andrieu:  One problem. many of the URL still point to the old 
  one?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Right, right.
Joe Andrieu:  Dmitriz give feedback.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Which org do you need to be admin of?
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I'm seeing if I'm admin, not sure
Orie Steele:  Can i become an admin to do some repo upgrade.  I 
  can't do anything but open issues.  if it was in CCG I could but 
  if I am admin of other WG
Kim Hamilton Duffy: May need DB folks
Joe Andrieu:  Kim can you do it?
Kim Hamilton Duffy: You're admin too Joe
Orie Steele: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-examples
Joe Andrieu: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/111
Joe Andrieu:  Those are the issues we were queued to discuss. 
  next is BC examples. Orie please intro to us.
Orie Steele:   This was created ages ago. idea was to create repo 
  with examples of all the formats.  so implementers can look at 
  real data.
  ... the concept is a repo of VC examples will allow us to check 
  in real world examples that are verifiable with examples that 
  work.
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Done. fyi, going forward, the following 
  people are admins. Christopher, Joe, Manu, Markus, Dave Longley, 
  Orie, David Lehn
Kim Hamilton Duffy: If any one needs access, ping that set of ppl
  ... there was a proposal that genesh would be have a role.  
  needs one more person.  this could be a base point for many other 
  initiatives.
Ganesh Annan: Yes interested!
Ganesh Annan: Having mic issues
Joe Andrieu:  Ok, cool!  Genesh are you around?  interested in 
  being an editor?  Genesh?
Ganesh Annan: S/Genesh/Ganesh/
Orie Steele:  He does have an open PR to make him editor.
Joe Andrieu:  I think, this makes the criteria.  any questions?
Orie Steele:   I just made him code owner. adding examples.
Manu Sporny:   I want to highlight some concerns.  The goal is to 
  add as many examples as possible. There is also some talk about 
  test-suite?  is that part of this?
Orie Steele:   So, TBD.  my intention is to provide some other 
  CCG work items.  problem we just don't have examples out there.  
  use the BC examples and helpful to have everything in one place.
Manu Sporny:   I'm, i'm ... that's fine.  I am concerned about 
  smashing this all together.  ... In the past, it as always 
  required us to pull it out into another repo..   just a note of 
  conern.
Joe Andrieu:  Any other comments?
Joe Andrieu: https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/charter/
Joe Andrieu:   Moving on.  next topic:  the chairs are in process 
  of updating the charter.  there are a couple where we are out of 
  sync.  we want to clean it up.

Topic: CCG Process

Joe Andrieu: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_7noTaKsqN-TBR7VgECpy-H-zS05rNds81GyRw95jE/edit
  ... especially as our roles have migrated to more registry 
  related approach.
  ... there are two parts i'd like to highlight.  one is electing 
  chairs.
Joe Andrieu:   Most of what I am going to walk thru doesn't 
  necessarily have consensus.  but I wanted to have a conversation 
  about this.
Orie Steele: I am ready
Joe Andrieu:  Super powers activate [scribe assist by Orie 
  Steele]
Orie Steele: ...
Orie Steele: ...See the document regarding the current proposal.
Orie Steele: ... Once approved, we will be open for new 
  elections.
Orie Steele: ... In case there are vacancies, remaining chairs 
  may appoint, hold an election or wait.
Orie Steele: ... If no action is taken, seats will be open at the 
  next election.
Orie Steele: ... No limits on relection
Orie Steele: ... So thats out thoughts, see the document.
Manu Sporny:  Sounds good... [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Seems a little more complicated than what we 
  might need... seems generally good
Joe Andrieu:  Feel free to comment on the doc, via the 
  mailinglist or now in IRC or voice [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... We wanted it to be simple, try and use the 
  simplest option first.
Orie Steele: ... Kim? Chris?
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Continuity vs desire to bring in new 
  blood.... [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... We were thinking that chris might give up his 
  seat first...
Orie Steele: ... We dont get paid for this....
Orie Steele: ... If people are excited, we would love to support 
  that
Orie Steele: ... We want to leave room for new leadership
Orie Steele: ChrisA: as kim mentioned, i've been here the 
  longest, and there is interest by others to participate... im 
  still excited, but I will hold my gunpowder, and let someone else 
  run... i may run again... or fill a vacancy
Orie Steele: ... In general our community runs off no principle 
  objections
Orie Steele: ... We suspect many elections won't require a formal 
  vote
Joe Andrieu: S/principle/principled/
Orie Steele: ... There are some edge cases, we want to make 
  simpler, but i can live with it as is
Orie Steele: ... We have something powerful here, community 
  groups can last for a long time, need long term support and 
  leadership
Orie Steele: ... One of our unique advantages is continuity
Joe Andrieu:  Thats how we are approaching the election...

Topic: Removing a Chair

Joe Andrieu:  What are the situations where is would be 
  appropriate to remove a chair? [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Things beyond what the W3C would require?
Orie Steele: ... We have committed to "Code of Ethics and 
  Professional Conduct"
Orie Steele: ... In terms of removing a chair, we are not talking 
  about that...
Orie Steele: ... There are times when people are complaint, but 
  where the group feels that they should still be removed...
Orie Steele: ChrisA: I've been in standards for 30 years... we 
  want to address the 80-20 / 90-10... we feel like the W3C 
  standards address the edge cases...
Orie Steele: ... Most common reasons: absence, not keeping up, 
  letting other chairs do all the work,
Orie Steele: ... Need a mechanism to give them a warning...
Orie Steele: ... There can be cases where the person just 
  disapears, and there is no response...
Orie Steele: ... We have all experienced cases where the 
  leadership is struggling to work together... styles, 
  communicatiions...
Orie Steele: ... Something I wanted us to have: things should not 
  escalate immediatly to the public... we should have direct 
  converstation internally first.
Joe Andrieu:  Lets walk through the bullet points: [scribe assist 
  by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Chairs may be removed from their duties through 
  a no confidence vote...
Orie Steele: ... See the removal of a chair doc here: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/15_7noTaKsqN-TBR7VgECpy-H-zS05rNds81GyRw95jE/edit
Orie Steele: ... Chris thoughts on game theory? only 1 call for 1 
  chair at a time...
Orie Steele: ... Those are the bullet points, please provide 
  feedback
Orie Steele: ChrisA: one of the key things here is...
Orie Steele: ... We want this to resemble the consensus building 
  process our community has... on the other hand there may be good 
  reasons for this...
Orie Steele: ... For complaints about the W3C standards, use that 
  mechanism...
Orie Steele: ... This is for objections to leadership direction, 
  not professional standards and ethics...
Orie Steele: ... There could be legit reasons why a chair, isn't 
  working out...
Orie Steele: ... We want to provide ways for the community to 
  allow negotiation and collaboration
Joe Andrieu:  Questions or feedback? [scribe assist by Orie 
  Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Please use email, comment on google doc....
Orie Steele: ... Expect to see this chartered first, then we will 
  do the election
Manu Sporny: +1 For moving this stuff forward.
Orie Steele: +1
Joe Andrieu:  Hopefully this will last us [scribe assist by Orie 
  Steele]
Orie Steele: ... Again, please provide feedback.
Juan Caballero: Thanks all
